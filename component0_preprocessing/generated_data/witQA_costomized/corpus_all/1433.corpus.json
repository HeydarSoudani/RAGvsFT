        "content": "Little Annie Fanny is a comics series by Harvey Kurtzman and Will Elder. It appeared in 107 two- to seven-page episodes in Playboy magazine from October 1962 to September 1988. Little Annie Fanny is a humorous satire of contemporary American society and its sexual mores. Annie Fanny, the title character, is a statuesque, buxom young blonde woman who innocently finds herself nude in every episode. The series is notable for its painted, luminous color artwork and for being the first full-scale, multi-page comics feature in a major American publication.\nHarvey Kurtzman, a cartoonist, created the series at the culmination of his career. He had launched Mad magazine, worked briefly for Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner and on a series of solo and collaborative projects, then returned to working for Hefner with Little Annie Fanny. Each episode of the comic strip was designed and written by Kurtzman and rendered in oil, tempera, and watercolor by Elder. Hefner edited each episode, often requiring detailed changes to ensure that the series remained true to the magazine's editorial style. Critical reaction was mixed, with most praising the elaborate, fully painted comic, but some dismissing it as falling short of Kurtzman's full potential. The complete series was collected into two volumes in 2000 and 2001 by Dark Horse Comics."

        "content": "Annie Fanny is the feature's lead character. Like other young women in Playboy pictorials, Annie is beautiful, buxom, and often unclothed. She is sexually innocent, oblivious to the worldliness around her. Like her forebear Goodman Beaver, Annie was conceived as a modern Candide, above the story's corruptions and temptations. Unlike Goodman, however, Annie is never shocked or offended; she remains blithe. The authors of Icons of the American Comic Book say Annie \"glides through a changing world with an untiring optimism\" with a \"good-natured lack of desire\". She is insulated from the carnal nature of those around her, who explain the new rules of society to her each episode. Ruthie, Annie's mother hen roommate, appears in the first episode and remains in the strip throughout its run. Wanda Homefree, Annie Fanny's wild and shapely best friend, first appears in an episode-10 beauty contest as Miss Greenwich Village and is often seen at Annie's side throughout the remainder of the series. Ralphie Towzer, Annie's nerdy-but-hip do-gooder boyfriend, has the look of Goodman Beaver (with playwright Arthur Miller's eyeglasses and pipe) and the temperament of a strait-laced, chastising prude. Solly Brass, Annie's huckster agent, is based on actor Phil Silvers.A number of other characters in Little Annie Fanny are derived from Gray's Little Orphan Annie. Sugardaddy Bigbucks, Annie's surrogate father and a powerful, manipulative capitalist, is based on Daddy Warbucks. His mysterious assistant, the Wasp, derives from Warbucks' assistant the Asp, and Punchjab, his bodyguard, comes from the character Punjab. Other supporting characters include ad man Benton Battbarton (whose name is taken from the advertising agencies Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn and Benton & Bowles), Battbarton's rival Huck Buxton (modeled on gap-toothed British actor Terry-Thomas), Duncan Fyfe Hepplewhite (an art plagiarist), and Freddie Flink (who resembles comic actor Fred Gwynne from Car 54, Where Are You?)."

        "content": "Little Annie Fanny takes the reader through the changing attitudes of American culture, satirizing contemporary trends and fads. In each of the 107 episodes, Annie experiences the latest popular movie, fashion statement, national politics, or society headline. During the strip's first decade, when it ran up to eleven times per year, Annie meets caricatures of the Beatles (who lust for Annie), Sean Connery (playing \"James Bomb\"), reclusive Catcher in the Rye author J. D. Salinger (as \"Salinger Fiengold\"), NFL champions Green Bay Packers (as the \"Greenback Busters\"), and Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, and Sonny & Cher on the \"Hoopadedoo Show\" (Hullabaloo show). During these early years, the strip pokes fun at miniskirts, LSD, free love, and bra burning. Background caricatures include Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, prissy-but-powerful J. Edgar Hoover, unisex fashion designer Rudi Gernreich, and the \"Put a Tiger in Your Tank\" ad campaign of Humble Oil. During the 1970s, when the strip ran three to five times per year, Annie sees violent films such as A Clockwork Orange and The French Connection and meets sex novelist Philip Roth, consumer advocate Ralph Nader, chess champion Bobby Fischer, and shock rocker Alice Cooper. She experiences disco, streaking, C.B. radio, nudist resorts, and women's liberation. Background \"eye pops\" include Hollywood heavy Charles Bronson, Laugh-In's Arte Johnson, the Avis TV commercial's O. J. Simpson, and Star Wars' C-3PO. In the 1980s, when Little Annie Fanny appeared once or twice a year, Annie deals with personal computers, goes to Urban Cowboy's Gilley's Club, cruises on The Love Boat, and encounters Indiana Jones, Ayatollah Khomeini, Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, and Woody Allen. Elder's background gags include the Coneheads, Howard Cosell, Miss Piggy, E.T., and Billy Beer."

        "content": "Comics historian Don Markstein said that Little Annie Fanny \"reached a high point seldom achieved by cartoon art\", saying \"Harvey Kurtzman ... strove for most of his life to advance the boundaries of comics, not just in terms of storytelling but also in production values\", concluding that Little Annie Fanny achieved at least the latter. About its venue he said, \"Playboy magazine, whatever you may say about its content, always did a first-rate job of printing color pictures.\" According to comics commentators Randy Duncan and Matthew J. Smith, the series \"reads today as an amusing look at the evolving mores of the sexual revolution\". Comics editor Monte Beauchamp said that Little Annie Fanny was \"the most elaborate comic strip ever created\" and cartoonist-critic R. C. Harvey called it \"a masterpiece ... the most lavish color comic strip of all time\".Not all were as impressed. Noting that Kurtzman was financially strapped before making his living for twenty-six years from Playboy, historian Paul Buhle wrote: \"The strip had many brilliant early moments, but went downhill as the writer and artist bent to editor Hugh Hefner's demands for as much titillation as possible.\" Cartoonist Art Spiegelman said that Little Annie Fanny devolved from the more interesting Goodman Beaver. Underground cartoonist Robert Crumb, whose career Kurtzman helped launch, scorned Playboy and Annie. Monty Python's Terry Gilliam, the former assistant editor of Help!, said that Little Annie Fanny was not as sharp as Kurtzman's earlier work: \"technically brilliant but ... slightly compromised.\" Art agent and publisher Denis Kitchen, who handles Kurtzman and Eisner's estates, said that \"most Kurtzman devotees would not consider Little Annie Fanny genius work ... [and] some would argue the opposite: that it was genius diluted or degraded\". Kitchen placed the onus on Kurtzman's employer Hefner, who \"was often a punctilious taskmaster with a heavy red pen who often had very different ideas about what was funny or satiric\" and insisted that each strip \"had to include Annie disrobing\". Beauchamp agreed: \"Unfortunately, Hefner was notorious for his heavy editorial hand.\" Duncan and Smith also agreed, and wrote that \"humor sometimes mixes awkwardly with the loaded topics of the era, and some have found Annie's lack of character development and the requisite sexual hijinks an impediment to taking her seriously.\" However, they repeated their respect: \"The eternally innocent Annie performed admirably as a nonjudgmental witness to the changing tides of the sexual revolution.\"American cartoonist Budd Root cited Little Annie Fanny as one of the inspirations for his independent comic book series Cavewoman."

The photograph, taken by American photojournalist Steve McCurry near the Pakistani city of Peshawar, appeared on the June 1985 cover of National Geographic. While the portrait's subject initially remained unknown, she was identified by early 2002: Gula, an ethnic Pashtun from Afghanistan's Nangarhar Province, was a 12-year-old child residing in Pakistan's Nasir Bagh.\nIn light of the Cold War, the portrait was described as the \"First World's Third World Mona Lisa\" in reference to the 16th-century painting of the same name by Leonardo da Vinci. Gula's image became \"emblematic\" in some social circles as the \"refugee girl/woman located in some distant camp\" that was deserving of compassion from the Western viewer, and also as a symbol of Afghanistan to the West. CNN called it the 'world's most famous photograph'."

In January 2002, a National Geographic team traveled to Afghanistan to find her. Upon learning that the Nasir Bagh refugee camp was soon to close, McCurry inquired of its remaining residents, one of whom knew Gula's brother and was able to send word to her hometown. Several women falsely identified themselves as the Afghan Girl. In addition, after being shown the 1984 photograph, several young men erroneously identified her as their wife.\nThe team found Gula, then around age 30, in a remote region of Afghanistan; she had returned to her native country from the refugee camp in 1992. Her identity was confirmed by John Daugman using iris recognition. She recalled being photographed. She had been photographed on only three occasions: in 1984 and during the search for her when a National Geographic producer took the identifying photographs that led to the reunion with McCurry. She had never seen Afghan Girl until it was shown to her in 2002.\nA devout Muslim, Gula normally wears a burqa and was hesitant to meet McCurry, as he was a male from outside the family.  After finding Gula, National Geographic covered the costs of medical treatment for her family and a pilgrimage to Mecca.Pashtun by ethnicity and from a rural background, Gula's family fled their village in eastern Nangarhar during the Soviet Union's bombing of Afghanistan when she was around six years old. Along with her father, brother, and three sisters, she walked across the mountains to Pakistan to the Nasir Bagh refugee camp in 1984 where she was photographed.On 26 October 2016, Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency arrested Gula for living in Pakistan with forged documents. She was sentenced to fifteen days in detention and deported to Afghanistan. Following the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban in 2021, women's rights were curtailed under their conservative rule, and high-profile women were threatened or intimidated. The Afghan Girl photograph had made Gula globally famous, hence her prominence put her in danger. She sought assistance to leave the country, and was evacuated to Italy with the support of its government in response to appeals from nonprofit organizations."

Photographs of Gula were featured as part of a cover story on her life in the April 2002 issue of National Geographic and she was the subject of a television documentary, Search for the Afghan Girl, that aired in March 2002. In recognition of her, National Geographic set up the Afghan Girls Fund, a charitable organization with the goal of educating Afghan girls and young women. In 2008, the fund's scope was broadened to include boys and the name was changed to Afghan Children's Fund.A 2019 article in the Indian magazine The Wire that described a 2002 interview with Gula says that she was angered by the photograph being taken and published without her consent. The writer for The Wire suggests that this is because \"it is not welcome for a girl of traditional Pashtun culture to reveal her face, share space, make eye contact and be photographed by a man who does not belong to her family.\""

        "content": "Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights lists the prohibited grounds against which discrimination in illegal. The text states that\"The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\"Unlike the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, there is no general right to equal treatment, only in the areas covered by the Convention. However, the article covers an open-ended list of prohibited grounds for discrimination and has been expanded over time to include such grounds as sexual orientation. In the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, the interpretation of the article has expanded over time to include indirect discrimination. Protocol 12 to the European Convention on Human Rights expands on Article 14 to include a freestanding prohibition of discrimination in \"any right set forth by law\". Introduced in 2000, it has been ratified by 20 of 47 Council of Europe states as of 2021.In early cases before the European Court of Human Rights the court assumed that for Article 14 to be relevant, a breach of one of the substantive Convention rights had to have occurred. If the court did find a substantive breach, it would not find it necessary to consider Article 14. In the Belgian Linguistic case in 1968, the Belgian government argued that Article 14 was not relevant unless there was a substantive breach. For the first time, the court rejected this argument. Following this case, the court considers that for Article 14 to be considered \"it suffices that the facts of a case fall within the ambit of another substantive provision of the Convention or its Protocols\".The court focuses on substantive equality rather than formal equality, and therefore it considers affirmative action acceptable in certain circumstances. According to the court's case law, any difference in treatment based on fixed status must be proportional to the justified aims pursued and the margin of appreciation has especially narrowed with regard to different treatment based exclusively on ethnic origin, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. For example, in the 2013 case Vallianatos and Others v. Greece a registered partnership scheme that only recognized different-sex couples was ruled to be a violation of Article 14 because it discriminated against same-sex couples."

Ezek 15:1\u20138 in particular talks about the worthlessness of wood from a vine (in relation to disobedient Judah). A branch cut from a vine is worthless except to be burned as fuel. This appears to fit more with the statements about the disciples than with Jesus' description of himself as the vine.\nEzek 17:5\u201310 contains vine imagery which refers to a king of the house of David, Zedekiah, who was set up as king in Judah by Nebuchadnezzar. Zedekiah allied himself to Egypt and broke his covenant with Nebuchadnezzar (and therefore also with God), which would ultimately result in his downfall (17:20\u201321). Ezek 17:22\u201324 then describes the planting of a cedar sprig which grows into a lofty tree, a figurative description of the Messiah. But it is significant that Messiah himself is not described in Ezekiel 17 as a vine, but as a cedar tree. The vine imagery here applies to Zedekiah's disobedience."

The queen gives the princess a special charm that will protect her as long as she wears it.\nThe princess and her servant travel for a time, and eventually the princess grows thirsty. She asks the maid to go and fetch her some water, but the maid simply says: \"If you want water, get it for yourself. I do not want to be your servant any longer.\" So the princess has to fetch herself water from the nearby stream. She wails softly: \"What will become of me?\" The charm answers: \"Alas, alas, if your mother knew, her loving heart would break in two.\" After a while, the princess gets thirsty again. So she asks her maid once more to get her some water. But again the evil servant says, \"I will not serve you any longer, no matter what you or your mother say.\" The servant leaves the poor princess to drink from the river by her dainty little hands. When she bends to the water her charm falls out of her bosom and floats away.\nThe maid takes advantage of the princess's vulnerability. She orders the princess to change clothes with her and the horses as well. She threatens to kill the princess if she doesn't swear never to say a word about this reversal of roles to any living being. Sadly, the princess takes the oath. The maid servant then rides off on Falada, while the princess has to mount the maid's nag. At the palace, the maid poses as princess and the \"princess servant\" is ordered to guard the geese with a little boy called Conrad. The false bride orders Falada to be killed, as she fears he might talk. The real princess hears of this and begs the slaughterer to nail Falada's head above the doorway where she passes with her geese every morning.\nThe next morning the goose girl addresses Falada's head over the doorway: \"Falada, Falada, thou art dead, and all the joy in my life has fled\", and Falada answers \" Alas, Alas, if your mother knew, her loving heart would break in two.\" On the goose meadow, Conrad watches the princess comb her beautiful hair and he becomes greedy to pluck one or two of her golden locks. But the goose girl sees this and says a charm: \"Blow wind, blow, I say, take Conrad's hat away. Do not let him come back today until my hair is combed today.\" And so the wind takes his hat away, and he cannot return before the goose girl has finished brushing and plaiting her hair.\nMeanwhile, Conrad goes to the king and declares he will not herd geese with this girl any longer because of the strange things that happen. The king tells him to do it one more time, and the next morning hides and watches. He finds everything as Conrad has told. That evening, he asks the princess to tell him her story. But she refuses to say anything because of her oath. The king suggests that she might tell everything to the iron stove. She agrees, climbs into the stove and tells her story while the king listens from outside.\nAs the king is convinced she has told the truth, he has the goose girl clad in royal clothes. He then tricks the false princess into \"choosing her own punishment\". While each choice is different in each version of the story, in the classic version, she tells the king that a false servant should be dragged through town naked in a barrel with internal spikes. As a result, she is punished that way until she dies.\nAfter that, the prince and the true princess are married and reign over their kingdom for many years."

        "content": "Despite the story being viewed as obscure, there have been many film versions, from countries ranging from Germany to even America. Falada is often restored to life in film versions, or even spared entirely. While the Queen is implied to have died in the original story, many versions also have her survive to expose the false bride at the wedding. The false bride's motive for suggesting such a cruel punishment varies by retelling; in some, she is simply too ignorant to recognize herself, others have her play along to keep the charade, and others imply she has believed the king is talking about the true bride. Such film versions include:\n\nHarold MacGrath adapted the story into a novel, which was then developed into a 1915 American silent film starring Marguerite Clark. In this version, the princess is stolen at birth and raised as a goose-girl, by a courtier who places his own daughter in her stead. The king she was engaged to at birth falls in love with her without knowing who she is. The courtier's daughter, Hildegarde, is ignorant of the truth and portrayed sympathetically in the original novel, but the film version restores her role as a villainess, where she is raised by her father and is only presented as the princess when she has come of age. The film is believed to be lost.\nThe plot was reworked into 2002's The Princess and the Pea, combining it with another fairy tale.\nThe Goose Girl, a 1957 West German film by Fritz Genschow.\nThe fairy tale was shown in the 1960s television show Jackanory during Season 1, Episode 38 and was read by Dilys Hamlett.\nIn 1985, Tom Davenport adapted the story into a short film as one of his \"From the Brothers Grimm\" series. While visibly set in the American Appalachia, the narration refers to the characters as princesses, princes, and kings, implying that the story retained its European setting. This version is more faithful to Grimm, as Falada is not restored and the false bride is put to death.\nThe story was adapted by East German studio DEFA for their fairytale movie series in the 1989 film The Goose Princess (Die Geschichte von der G\u00e4nseprinzessin und ihrem treuen Pferd Falada), directed by Konrad Petzold.\nTitled \"The Goose Maiden\" in this version, the tale was loosely adapted into a 1999 German short animated episode with slight differences from the source material. This episode was a part of the series SimsalaGrimm. While Falada is still beheaded, this version has him restored to life. There is no prince, but the king himself is the betrothed. Another change is that the princess has been bewitched into forgetting who she is, rather than being forced into posing as the goose-girl.\nThe story was featured in the anime Manga Sekai Mukashi Banashi.

Calvin learns that many people in the nearby Maine town of Preacher's Corners think Charles and Calvin are mad for living in the mansion. The house is said to be \"a bad house\" with a history of sad events, disappearances, and mysterious noises which Charles attributes to \"rats in the walls\". Calvin finds a hidden compartment in the library containing an old map of a deserted village called Jerusalem's Lot, a mysterious area the townsfolk avoid. Their curiosity piqued, Charles and Calvin set out to explore the village.\nThe two find a decayed Puritan settlement. Nothing, including animals, has set foot in the town since its abandonment. Exploring a church, they discover an obscene parody of the Madonna and Child and an inverted cross. At the pulpit, they find a book filled with Latin and Druidic runes entitled De Vermis Mysteriis, or \"The Mysteries of the Worm\". When Charles touches the book, the church shakes, and something gigantic moves in the ground beneath. The two flee the village.\nThe Preacher's Corners' inhabitants begin fearing Charles. They chase him from one house with rocks and guns. Charles asks Mrs. Cloris, Chapelwaite's former maid, for information about Jerusalem's Lot. She reveals a rift in Charles' family caused by his grandfather, Robert Boone, trying to steal De Vermis Mysteriis from his brother, Philip (presumably to destroy it). Philip was a minister involved in the occult who, on October 31, 1789, vanished along with the population of Jerusalem's Lot. Charles dismisses it as superstition but cannot forget what he saw in the church.\nCalvin discovers a diary in the library, encrypted with a rail fence cipher. Before he can decipher it, Charles takes him into the cellar to check for rats. Hidden behind the walls they find the undead corpses of two of his relatives, Marcella and Randolph Boone. Charles recognizes them as \"nosferatu\". The two flee the cellar, and Calvin seals the trapdoor.\nAs Charles recovers from the encounter, Calvin cracks the cipher. The diary, written by Robert Boone, details the history of Jerusalem's Lot and the events leading to the mass disappearance. The village was founded by one of Charles' distant ancestors, James Boon, who was the leader of an inbred witchcraft cult. Philip and Robert took up residence in Chapelwaite, Philip was taken in by Boon's cult, and he acquired De Vermis Mysteriis at Boon's behest. Philip and Boon used the book to call forth a supernatural entity referred to as \"The Worm\". In his final entry, Robert curses the whip-poor-will birds that have descended upon Chapelwaite.\nCharles feels compelled to return to Jerusalem's Lot. Calvin tries to stop him but finally relents and accompanies his master. They discover a butchered lamb on the church altar, lying on top of De Vermis Mysteriis. Charles moves the lamb and takes the book to destroy it, but a congregation of undead appears, including Philip and Boon. Charles becomes possessed and begins chanting, summoning forth the Worm. Calvin knocks down Charles, freeing him from possession. Charles sets fire to the book. The Worm lashes out from below, killing Calvin before disappearing. Before Charles can recover Calvin's body, Boon forces Charles to flee. In his final letter to \"Bones\", Charles announces his intention to commit suicide, ending the Boone family line.\nAn \"editor's note\" attributes Charles's letters and the death of Calvin to insanity rather than supernatural occurrences in Jerusalem's Lot. The editor notes that Charles was not the last of his line: a bastard relative still exists, the editor himself, James Robert Boone, who has moved to Chapelwaite to restore the family name. James notes that Charles was right about one thing: \"This place badly needs the services of an exterminator. There are some huge rats in the walls, by the sound.\" The note is dated October 2, the same date as Charles' first letter."

It was serialized in Avadh Akhbar between 1878 and 1883 before it was published in four large volumes by the Nawal Kishore Press. The story follows a wandering character named Azad and his companion, Khoji, from the streets of late-nineteenth-century Lucknow to the battlefields of the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878) in Constantinople and Russia. The work's status as a novel has been debated, but it is thought by most scholars to be one of the first novels (or a proto-novel) in Urdu.\nSarshar conceived of writing Fasana-e-Azad after the success of the articles he contributed to Avadh Akhbar under the title \"Zarafat\" (\"Wit and Humour\"). Perennially popular, Fasana-e-Azad has been a subject of study by literary critics as the first Urdu novel and for its influence on the literary form's later development. It is noted for its colourful descriptions of Lucknow, its people, and its culture."

        "content": "Sarshar, a teacher in Kheri District of Uttar Pradesh, joined the Nawal Kishore Press (founded by Munshi Nawal Kishore) in Lucknow as an editor of Avadh Akhbar. He wrote a column for the magazine about Lucknow's feudal culture, which inspired him to write Fasana-e-Azad.On 8 August 1878, Sarshar was appointed editor of Avadh Akhbar. His first entry in a series called \"Zarafat\" was published in the 13 August 1878 issue, and the column appeared regularly thereafter. These columns, which eventually made up the first 500 pages of the book, satirize urban life, usually centering on a wandering figure such as Azad or a minor character. This was in keeping with the influence of Charles Dickens's The Pickwick Papers and Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote on Sarshar. The popularity of Zarafat led Sarsharr to continue the stories and develop them into a narrative called Fasana-e-Azad.In one piece, published on 23 September, Sarshar explained his reasons for writing the series. He said that their intention was to use humour to allow Avadh Akhbar's readers to familiarize themselves with a social culture, characterized by proper conversational style and idiomatic fluency suited to a variety of social occasions, which could be used in a variety of social gatherings. Sarshar believed that such an education would improve the country and its people; pleasure in reading humorous articles would encourage refinement and higher thought."

He has a keen eye for female beauty. Azad meets two sisters and falls in love with Husna Ara, the older sister. Although she loves him too, she sets a condition for their marriage: Azad must go to Turkey and fight with the Turks in their war with the Russians. Azad leaves for Turkey with Khoji, his sidekick, a dwarf with a fondness for opium and delusions about his handsomeness and martial prowess. They have a number of adventures in Turkey and Russia; several noblewomen fall love with Azad, who remains more-or-less true to Husn Ara.Azad, Khoji, and two female European admirers return to India in triumph. Azad marries Husna Ara, and the two European women become social workers. He becomes the father of twins and is well-known and respected, devoting a great deal of time to the propagation of new ideas, education, commerce and industry.

        "content": "Study of Fasana-e-Azad began after Sarshar's death with the publication of articles by Brij Narayan Chakbast and Bishan Narayan Dar, two of his contemporaries. Much scholarship has focused on its relationship to the history of the novel. Asaduddin describes the general consensus that \"Critics and writers call Fasana-e Azad a novel but with some reservations.\"Sarshar himself was the first to call Fasana-e-Azad a novel, in 1879. Ralph Russell calls it \"a work which brought permanently into Urdu literature some of the major elements of the modern novel.\" Vaq\u0101r \u02bfAz\u0324\u012bm's textbook on Urdu prose describes it as important in the history of the novel, saying it has had \"a profound impact on our novels\u2019 development, for which all future novelists owe Sarshar a debt of gratitude.\" Dubrow argues that inconsistencies the work's plot and characterization are actually common features of serialized works, which Sarshar intentionally improved to be more novelistic when he revised his columns for book publication. Mohammad Asaduddin highlights the way that Sarshar depicts ordinary life with unembellished language as an important novelistic trait. He also highlights the lack of supernatural elements which would have aligned Fasana-e-Azad more strongly with the genre of d\u0101st\u0101n or romance.Ultimately, however, Asaduddin concludes that Fasana-e-Azad is not a \"novel proper\" because its plot is too unfocused and its characters too unrealistic. Plot and characters, and especially their failure to conform to Victorian standards of literary realism, are common grounds for the assessment that Fasana-e-Azad is not quite a novel. Muhammad Ahsan Farooqi attributed the many uncohesive subplots to Sarshar's \"carelessness\": \"Sarshar had no plan and stuffed in any story wherever he wanted and ended it whenever the mood struck.\" According to Farooqi, the love between Azad and Husn Ara is the only thread running through the work from beginning to end. Bishan Narayan Dar wrote, \"Fasana-e-Azad is not a proper novel, since its plot was not conceived according to any plan. It has neither beginning, nor middle, nor end; rather, it is a collection of unconnected snapshots of the society and culture in which Sarshar lived.\" Chakbast questioned how Azad's character (which he described as a \"uncontrollable, carefree, itinerant, and sometimes even sinful man\") could abruptly become \"so chaste and refined,\" finding the character's development \"against the law of nature.\" Author Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah also called the characters' development inconsistent."

With this tune, the hymn has been included in several hymnals, such as Christian Friedrich Witt's Neues Cantional and the Evangelisches Gesangbuch, where it is numbered EG 83. Gerhardt's hymn was however also sung to the tune of \"Herr Gott, erh\u00f6re die Gerechtigkeit\", Zahn No. 7669, and several other melodies were composed for the text: Johannes Zahn lists three 17th-century melodies composed for \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\" (Nos. 7681\u20137683), three from the 18th century (Nos. 7684\u20137686, the first of which was composed for a reworked version of the text), and two from the 19th century (Nos. 7687\u20137688).The third part of a Passion setting presented in Rudolstadt in 1688 opens with Gerhardt's \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\" in the format of an aria, using the \"An Wasserfl\u00fcssen Babylon\" melody. Reinhard Keiser was the first composer who used Gerhardt's hymn in a Passion oratorio in Hamburg: his 1711 setting of Johann Ulrich K\u00f6nig's Thr\u00e4nen unter dem Creutze Jesus libretto opens with it. The second part of Johann Friedrich Fasch's setting of the Brockes Passion libretto, composed around 1717\u20131719, opens with a chorale adaptation of \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\". A Passion oratorio performed in Gotha in 1719 contained an aria based on an excerpt of Gerhardt's hymn.In 1720, Gottfried Heinrich St\u00f6lzel composed a meditation of the stations of the Cross as a Passion oratorio which he titled Die leidende und am Creutz sterbende Liebe Jesu (The love of Jesus which suffered and died on the Cross), which is also known by its incipit, Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld. Composed for Gotha, this oratorio knew many repeat performances, some of these in slightly modified versions: the oratorio was for instance performed in Leipzig in 1734, entitled Der Gl\u00e4ubigen Seele Geistliche Betrachtungen Ihres leidenden Jesu, directed by J. S. Bach, and, in 1736, in Rudolstadt and in N\u00fcrnberg.Three Passions by Georg Philipp Telemann are also known by their incipit Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld: a St Mark Passion of 1723, TWV 5:8, a St John Passion of 1745, TWV 5:30, and a St Matthew Passion of 1766, TWV 5:51. Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld, GWV 1119/24, is a church cantata for the last Sunday before Lent (Estomihi) composed by Christoph Graupner in 1724. Johann Gottfried Walther set \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\" for organ. BWV 267 is Johann Sebastian Bach's chorale harmonisation of Dachstein's hymn tune. Carl Heinrich Graun composed a Passion named after the hymn, Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld, GraunWV B:VII:4, for soloists, choir and orchestra, which has been called Kleine Passion (Little Passion), in comparison to his better-known Der Tod Jesu.Gottfried August Homilius, a Kreuzkantor in Dresden, composed a Passion cantata for soloists, choir and orchestra, HoWV I.2, printed by Breitkopf in 1775. Like his St Matthew Passion, HoWV 1.3, it starts with the words \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\". Chorale preludes on \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\" were composed by Johann Christian Kittel, Gustav Fl\u00fcgel, Carl Steinh\u00e4user and Philipp Wolfrum.

The song is \"bolstered\" by a \"sunny, glimmering riff\" and both singing and rap verses which critics noted to spotlight Doja Cat as equal parts singer and rapper. It is distinguishable by its slightly distorted signature guitar lead. Lyrical themes include \"romance, passion, bold sexual desires, and tenderness all at once\". The song's chorus interpolates the melody from Olivia Newton-John's \"Physical\", to which songwriters Steve Kipner and Terry Shaddick are also credited as co-writers."

Jon Caramanica of The New York Times wrote that it \"mixes the breeze of lite 1980s funk with the bawdiness of 2020s hip-hop, a juggling act that Doja Cat has pioneered, if not trademarked, by now.\" Justin Cutro of Vulture described it as \"a silky, playful R&B jam\", while writers at Rolling Stone deemed it a \"groovy, disco-inflected jam\".  Heran Mamo of Billboard wrote that \"the slinky, sensual jam will definitely be a summer playlist staple with its groovy bass line\". Writing for Nylon, Steffanee Wang described the song as \"a mid-tempo pop number with guitar and sticky melodies\". Writing for Teen Vogue, Claire Dodson described the song as \"excellent\" and \"a shimmering ode to kissing [...] with a somewhat melancholy underlying melody that contrasts well with that signature soft-disco Doja beat.\" Anders Hare of Rated R&B wrote that the \"sunkissed, bouncy tune [...] features both musical prowesses sensually crooning about embracing the now with their significant others.\" Doja Cat and SZA's vocals were described as \"smooth\", \"sultry\" and \"evocative\". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard praised the duo's delivery and noted that they \"keep their rhymes tight and chorus vocals breathy, but don't mince words\". Both the song and its accompanying music video received all-round praise for its dreaminess and sensuality.Complex ranked \"Kiss Me More\" seventh on its mid-year list of the best songs of 2021 and named it one of the most \"infectious\" songs of the year. Describing it as \"light and uptempo\" and deeming it \"a masterclass in disco-adjacent pop music\", they praised Doja Cat's \"terrific job balancing singing and rapping over a catchy riff\" with her \"snappy flow\" and \"tongue-in-cheek punchlines\". Insider crowned \"Kiss Me More\" the best song on Planet Her and hailed it as \"easily one of the best songs released [in 2021]\" since \"every moment of this song is disarming and brilliant.\" Brandon Yu of Mic deemed it \"the most refined showcase of her many talents thus far\". In an album review for Consequence, Carys Anderson agreed that the song \"sums up every layer of Doja Cat\u2019s complex celebrity\" with its infectious guitar line and chanted refrain, ultimately making it \"a summery summation\" of the \"hyper-feminine, hyper-sexual, hyper-futuristic aesthetic\" of Planet Her."

Seido and their main rivals attempt to help the upperclassmen make it to nationals during the summer tournament. Once the summer tournament ends, the upperclassmen will be forced to retire, but Sawamura will help them to success, despite his lack of control. Some time later, Sawamura and his teammates, Furuya Satoru, Kominato Haruichi and Miyuki Kazuya, lead a new team, along with a few returning faces, through the fall tournament.

During his periodic revivals, Grimstone is dismayed to watch the aging crew and eventually, their descendants, slowly forget not only the mission, but everything about America, Earth, and even Robinello. Grimstone's periodic interventions, which sometimes force him to resort to violence to keep the crew in line, manages to keep the ship on-course for nearly 600 years.

Most notably, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky mentions the idea in his 1928 essay, \"The Future of Earth and Mankind\".\"The Voyage\", however, is widely regarded as the first use of the concept in fiction. It was published only shortly before Robert A. Heinlein's much more famous May 1941 \"Universe\". Both stories are broadly similar, involving a generation ship on which the passengers forget their past and come to see the ship as their original home. Brian Ash suggested that the first fictional treatment of the concept predates Wilcox's story, nothing the appearance of similar concept - but not central to the plot - in Laurence Manning's The Living Galaxy (1934).:\u200a74\u200aThe story was also the inspiration for A. E. van Vogt's \"Far Centaurus\", via John W. Campbell, which is based on the idea of arriving at a now-populated planet. In this case, the story revolves around four men on a sleeper ship, not a generational ship, who learn that their 500-year trip now only takes three hours."

        "content": "Federalist No. 28, titled \"The Same Subject Continued: The Idea of Restraining the Legislative Authority in Regard to the Common Defense Considered\", is a political essay by Alexander Hamilton and the twenty-eighth of The Federalist Papers. The essay was published on December 28, 1787, under the pseudonym Publius, the name under which all The Federalist Papers were published. This is the last of the three essays discussing the powers of the federal government over a standing military, directly following Federalist No. 26 and Federalist No. 27. Its theme of defense would be continued for one more essay in Federalist No. 29. \nFederalist No. 28 addresses circumstances in which military force may be used domestically by the federal government, with Hamilton arguing that it would be necessary only when an insurrection required federal intervention. He challenged the idea that a federal military would be repressive, arguing that it would be restrained by the nature of representative government. Failing that, he believed that state governments and the people would be in an advantageous position over a federal military when engaging in the natural right to self-defense. Federalist No. 28 gave a more sympathetic portrayal of state governments than most of the Federalist Papers, describing them as a check on the federal government. Since the writing of this essay, the nature of military force has fundamentally changed, rendering his equivocation of federal, state, and civilian military technology obsolete."

        "content": "Hamilton begins by acknowledging truth in the argument that military force will sometimes be necessary in the course of governing, though he rejects the idea that it will be the standard method by which the law is enforced. He specifies that use of force by the federal government would only be necessary to suppress an insurrection that a state government could not control on its own, providing the Pennsylvania Mutiny and Shays' Rebellion as examples, as well as a potential conflict between New York and the Vermont Republic. He argues that a military is necessary for a country with representative government, or that it will be subject to the same instability that affected previous republics. Hamilton then proposes a scenario of several distinct confederacies of states, arguing that the same problem would still exist and that federal militaries would still be necessary. He uses this to demonstrate that combat readiness separate from militias will always be necessary, even if it does not take the form of a unitary government of all the states.\nHamilton next argues that the federal government would not be susceptible to tyranny because its components would be a representative government subject to the will of the people, rendering military repression of the people highly unlikely. In the event that such repression does occur, Hamilton argues that the right to self-defense would then take precedence. He says that the support of state governments and the entire population would make it easy to defend against the federal government, while the people of one state would be unable to defend against their state government. He describes the relationship of federal and state governments as one being a check on the other. Hamilton concludes that the practical aspects of military repression by the federal government make such concerns unreasonable."

Like all of the Federalist Papers, Federalist No. 28 was published under the pseudonym Publius in New York newspapers with the intention of explaining the provisions of the Constitution of the United States and persuading New York to ratify it. It was published in the Independent Journal, the Daily Advertiser, and the New-York Packet on December 28, 1787, and it was printed in the New-York Journal on January 2, 1788.Federalist No. 28 continues the arguments about use of force by the government that began in Federalist No. 24, and it directly follows Federalist No. 27 in its rebuttal of the anti-federalist argument that the military will be used to enforce federal law. The essay also supported the theory posited by James Madison in Federalist No. 10, stating that \"the obstacles to usurpation\" increase with the increased extent of the state. Hamilton's views of the use of force in relation to governance may have been influenced by examples of tyrannical government and resistance against it, including the American Revolutionary War."

        "content": "Hamilton presented further argument about how the people would protect themselves from tyrannical government in Federalist No. 29, referencing the right to bear arms. The argument that states had the right to defend themselves from the federal government would later be invoked by those in favor of nullification or secession, though in these cases the argument was often made as one of legal rights rather than natural rights. Federalist No. 28 has been invoked in multiple Supreme Court cases to analyze Hamilton's view of the relationship between the military and the government. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor referenced it in the 1991 case Gregory v. Ashcroft, and Justice Antonin Scalia did so in the 2006 case Hamdan v. Rumsfeld.Hamilton's arguments regarding the use of force may be reconsidered following the development of modern militaries and weapons of mass destruction in the 20th century. Particularly inapplicable to the 21st century is Hamilton's argument that state militias and private citizens would have access to the same military resources as the federal army. Hamilton's appeal to representative government has become the primary element of Federalist No. 28 that is applied to the present day."

        "content": "7 Seeds takes place an unknown number of years after the collision of a large meteorite with Earth. As a result of the impact, the climate of Japan has greatly changed from what the characters knew from the present day. In the Kansai region there are only two seasons, a dry season and a longer, heavier rainy season. Takahiro of Winter group describes the winters in the northern island of Hokkaid\u014d as being as mild as in Kanagawa Prefecture where he grew up. In addition, sea levels have risen greatly: downtown Yokohama is completely underwater, only the top hand of the statue in Nagasaki Peace Park is above the surface of the ocean. The geography of Japan has changed as well: after an eruption of Mount Aso, Ky\u016bsh\u016b has been split into two islands, and the Kansai region is separated from central Honsh\u016b by a wide strait. The series depicts a Japan in which, as a result of the new environment and mass extinctions, ecosystems have changed and several new species of animals and plants have evolved.\nFor example, on the island where Summer group B first lands, off the coast of Nagasaki Prefecture, Botan notes how few of the ecological niches are filled, including no birds or flying insects, and that the limited number of species are still radiating to fill empty niches. In particular, a local rodent resembling a rabbit is in the process of speciation into herbivorous and ravenously carnivorous versions, which are still visually similar. Other dangers new to the characters include swarms of carnivorous white cockroaches and gigantic Venus flytraps, sundews, and nepenthes. Species that are unchanged but were previously unknown in Japan include banana trees and crocodiles. Semimaru notes that neither on the island nor on the Ky\u016bsh\u016b mainland do they see any ants, bees, or similar insects.In the Kansai region, Fall group domesticates flightless birds about the size of a chicken and sheep that have grown to resemble llamas, which can be ridden, milked and shorn for wool. Izayoi tells Natsu that a local wasp is deadly, killing with a single sting, and another species has a sting that sickens the victim for a day. According to Akio, corn is the only crop from their seed cache that grows in the area's soils, but Fall group also cultivates a variety of tobacco with a narcotic effect when smoked.In the southern part of central Honsh\u016b, Natsu, Arashi, and Semimaru of Summer group B cross a desert with cactus scrub. Throughout the region they find remains of large reptiles that revive from estivation during the rainy season, which remind Natsu of velociraptors from Jurassic Park. These \"dinosaurs\", as the characters call them, have grassland and woodland varieties, and during the rainy season are the dominant predator from the south coast to at least as far north as Tokyo.\nOn the island where the Spring group first lands, off the coast of the Kant\u014d region, Hana notes that there are no vertebrates on land or in the sea, and Momotaro describes the ecology as similar to that of the Carboniferous Era. On land, there are giant insects the characters call \"boat beetles\" and swarms of bees with stings that are painful but not deadly, which force the group to live on rafts off-shore. In the island's swamps, there are giant praying mantis and giant dragonflies. While at the island, the group lives off shellfish and shallow-water nautiluses, but see no bony fish. The characters find the climate changed as well, as it is too overcast to see the stars for the first two weeks after they are awake, even though it is spring, a season that in the present day is noted for clear weather.\nOn the mainland of the Kant\u014d region, Spring group meets large aquatic lizards living among the submerged ruins of Yokohama, which hunt in groups. Nearby, in the ruins of central Tokyo, the party from Summer group B is attacked by a giant predatory fish, which Takahiro of Winter group identifies as descended from a deep-sea fish, the only kind of bony fishes to have survived. They also meet a fungus-like growth Takahiro calls \"blue mucus\", which infects Hana's skin when she touches it. This growth goes dormant in the dry season, and Takahiro realizes it is intolerant to salt and uses it to cure her.In northern Honsh\u016b near Sendai, Natsu, Arashi and Semimaru of Summer group B find the first flowers they have seen during their journey over most of the length of Japan.In southern Hokkaid\u014d, Winter group encounters grasslands populated by many mammals they do not know, including small-eared rodents, herds of unknown ruminants, and tigers with saber-teeth. They also meet wolves with the ability to project illusions normally used to help hunt.The project organizers also prepared sealed caches containing seeds and instructional books near the \"seven Fuji\". These seven Fuji are not related to the famous Mount Fuji, but are regional landmarks also named Fuji: \n\nBungo Fuji in \u014cita Prefecture is Mt. Yufudake, where the cache is marked by a statue of the Buddha Vairocana.\nOgino Fuji in Kanagawa Prefecture is Mt. Kyogatake, where the cache is marked by a statue of Monjubosatsu, the bodhisattva Manjusri.\nKobe Fuji in Hyogo Prefecture is Mount Futatabi of the Rokk\u014d Mountains, marked by a statue of Acala (Fud\u014d my\u014d-\u014d).\nNatori Fuji in Miyagi Prefecture is Mt. Taihaku, near Sendai, where the cache is marked by a statue of Kok\u016bz\u014d Bosatsu (\u0100k\u0101\u015bagarbha).\nAkan Fuji in Hokkaid\u014d is Mt. Meakandake, where the cache is marked by a statue of Avalokite\u015bvara, the goddess of mercy.\nTosa Fuji in Kumamoto Prefecture is Mount Takamori, marked by a statue of Mah\u0101sth\u0101mapr\u0101pta.\nNoto Fuji in Ishikawa Prefecture is Mount Takatsume-ya, where the cache is marked by a statue of goddess Kukurihime.\nFuji is a ghost ship with similar capabilities to the RP FLIP. The ghost ship is adrift at sea in a vast ship graveyard. It is marked by a painting of the buddha Samantabhadra riding on a white elephant's back. This Fuji was the only one kept hidden and used as a humans' shelter at the same time."

With a Stygian host on their heels, Almuric's soldiers had cut their way across the kingdom of Kush, only to be annihilated near the edge of Stygia's southern desert.\nIn the resulting conflict, when the Stygians and Kushites surrounded the trapped remnants, Conan sliced his way through the Stygian militia and fled on a camel, with Natala, into the southern desert. For days, the two pushed on, seeking water, until their camel died. Then, they continued on foot.\nWhen their canteen is empty, Conan prepares to slay Natala in an act of mercy-killing. However, they spy the distant city of Xuthal. Eventually, Conan and Natala enter Xuthal while pursued by an entrance guard. They soon encounter Thalis, a beautiful Stygian mage, who reveals the history of her fabled city and the existence of Thog. Thog is a monstrous demon from the city-states of ancient Valusia, his current form summoned by the sorcerers of Xuthal from the darkness between the stars. For an ageless time, Thog has haunted the depths of Xuthal in search of living flesh to support the continuing manifestation of his body on the physical plane.\nThalis falls in love with Conan and, to eliminate her rival, kidnaps Natala in the hopes of sacrificing her to Thog. Thalis first strips Natala of her tunic and flagellates her with a jewel-handled whip. Thog suddenly appears, snatches Thalis, and devours her. The demon returns for Natala, but Conan intervenes and saves her. Conan fights Thog with all his might, but is scarcely harming the demon's supernatural form, while receiving hideous wounds in the coils of its pseudopods and tentacles. However, Conan manages to pierce what he perceives as the head of the monster and throws it down a well. Conan frees Natala, who sets forth to help him, but he is rapidly dying. Fortunately, the Brythunian girl soon brings him a jade goblet full of golden wine, retrieved from a room with a dreaming woman of Xuthal in it. The beverage proves to be a life-giving elixir briefly mentioned by Thalis in a previous conversation, which miraculously heals all of Conan's wounds. Finally, the couple retrieve enough food and water for their journey through the rest of the desert. The two depart while Natala jokingly blames Conan for having aroused Thalis' lustful nature. He retorts playfully about the jealous nature of women."

Although Mulga Bill claims expertise in riding all things his ineptitude and subsequent accident suggest that he may only know how to ride a horse.\nThe poem was first published in The Sydney Mail on 25 July 1896 and was illustrated by Norman Hardy who depicts Mulga Bill sat astride the front wheel pedaling with his knees UNDER the handle bars establishing with certainty that he is riding an Ordinary on his perilous ride. It is amongst Paterson's most popular works.  A 1973 reprinting of the poem illustrated by Kilmeny & Deborah Niland has been continuously in print since publication and won the 1973 ABPA Book Design Award and the 1974 Visual Arts Board Award.The novel by H. G. Wells on cycling, The Wheels of Chance: A Bicycling Idyll was published in the same year as this poem.Ordinaries- the term \"Penny-Farthings\" is used interchangeably by many- were notoriously dangerous to ride on level ground, but Banjo has Mulga Bill cycling DOWNHILL on a mountain road at which point he gains so much speed that he becomes the Ordinary's PASSENGER, unable to stop or dismount it. On a standard bicycle one's feet could touch the ground to (inelegantly) brake their speed on a dirt road. But this being an Ordinary, once Mulga Bill sets off downhill with no previous experience riding one, he becomes a victim of his own hubris.  There is no escaping his fate and he narrowly escapes death when his ride concludes with him sailing off of a precipice and crashes into a creek. Pride indeed came before Mulga's fall\nThe model for the character of Mulga Bill was William Henry Lewis (1880-1968), who knew Paterson in the vicinity of Bourke, New South Wales. Lewis had bought his bicycle as a result of a drought when there was no feed for horses.Eaglehawk, Victoria\u2014once a rural mining town, now part of greater Bendigo\u2014was given as Mulga Bill's hometown ('Twas Mulga Bill, from Eaglehawk ...). This has been recognised with the development of the Mulga Bill Bicycle Trail, a scenic ride taking in many of the mining attractions, historic sites and modern-day amenities of Eaglehawk.Mulga is a very common species of Acacia that predominates the interior regions of the Australian bush, and colloquially, it is an alternative term for the Bush itself or wilderness regions,  for example \u2018up the mulga\u2019. This poem is extremely important to Australian culture because it includes the start of the cycling craze.  In the time this poem was written, everyone was buying bicycles because it was (and still partly is) popular in Australia.\nThe poem has been set to music and the poem title was the name of a prominent Australian folk music group (also known as a bush band) in the 1970s.\n\n\n== References =="

On several occasions, stargazing janitor Kane causes the frustrated doctor to have a sudden epiphany which allows him to progress in the launch effort. After realizing Kane is always around when he has these moments of insight, Hammer confronts Kane and learns of Kane's 8,000 year history of \"assisting\" scientists and inventors to make historic breakthroughs \u2013 all apparently to advance humanity's effort into exploring space. Unexpectedly, Kane himself does not have any understanding of how or why he has been doing this, nor familiarity with the scientific breakthroughs he's inspired. Kane feels compelled to enter the special man-sized room Dr. Hammer had inadvertently designed in the rocket just before launch, and once arriving in open space, transforms into his adult alien form."

He transformed, likely in 1523, the Latin penitential psalm De profundis into a hymn. Luther sent it as a sample to encourage Protestant colleagues to write psalm-hymns for use in German worship. A version in four stanzas first appeared in 1524 in Nuremberg in Etlich Cristlich lider (Some Christian songs), also called Achtliederbuch, the first Lutheran hymnal. The same year it appeared in Erfurt in Eyn Enchiridion. A version in five stanzas, with the ideas of stanza 2 as two stanzas developing the theme of \"grace alone\" more fully, was first published in 1524 in Wittenberg in Eyn geystlich Gesangk Buchleyn. Scholars debate if the shorter version is actually Luther's, or reduced by an editor from the longer version.The version in five stanzas, expressing essential Reformation doctrine, was designated as a regular component of several regional Lutheran liturgies. It was widely used at funerals, including Luther's own on 20 February 1546 in Halle. Along with Erhart Hegenwalt's hymnic version of Psalm 51, Luther's hymn was also adopted for use with the fifth part of Luther's Small Catechism, concerning confession."

Holmes goes to the photograph's hiding spot, finding a photo of Irene Adler in an evening dress and a letter addressed to him. In the letter, Adler tells Holmes she has left England with Norton and promises she will not compromise the King.\nWatson concludes the story by noting that Holmes always referred to Adler by the honourable title of \"the woman.\""

        "content": "Adler earns Holmes' unbounded admiration. When the King of Bohemia says, \"Would she not have made an admirable queen?  Is it not a pity she was not on my level?\" Holmes replies that Adler is indeed on a much different level from the King, implying that she was superior to the King all along.The beginning of \"A Scandal in Bohemia\" describes the high regard in which Holmes held Adler:\n\nTo Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer\u2014excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\nThis \"memory\" is kept alive by a photograph of Irene Adler, which had been deliberately left behind when she and her new husband took flight with the embarrassing photograph of her with the King. Holmes had then asked for and received this photo from the King, as payment for his work on the case. In \"The Five Orange Pips\" he comments to a client that he has been defeated on a mere handful of occasions and only once by a woman.\nIn derivative works, she is frequently used as a romantic interest for Holmes, a departure from Doyle's novels where he only admired her for her wit and cunning. In his Sherlock Holmes Handbook, Christopher Redmond notes \"the Canon provides little basis for either sentimental or prurient speculation about a Holmes-Adler connection.\""

However, Hlad\u00edk's main concern soon turns to his unfinished play, The Enemies, the story of a nineteenth-century man caught in a strange, repeating loop of experiences. Hlad\u00edk wishes to complete his play, which he feels will vindicate his previous mediocre literary output and life's work. \nOn the last night before his death, he prays to God, asking for one more year of time in which to finish the play. That night, he dreams of going to the Clementinum library, where the librarian has gone blind looking for a single letter that represents God. Someone returns an atlas to the library; Hlad\u00edk touches a letter in it and hears a voice that says, \"The time of your labor has been granted\".The next morning, Hlad\u00edk is taken outside to the firing squad. The sergeant gives the order to fire, but then time stops. Hlad\u00edk cannot move, but he remains conscious. After an initial day of panic, he understands that God has answered his prayer, giving him an additional year of subjective time, though no one else will realize that anything unusual has happened \u2013 the \"secret miracle\" of the story's title.\nWorking from memory, Hlad\u00edk mentally writes, expands, and edits his play, shaping every detail and nuance to his satisfaction.

However, it is unknown if Bierce's story was a specific influence on Borges' composition. In one of the story's best-known lines, Hladik reflects that \"irreality\" is \"one of art's requisites\". The line is often cited in discussions of Borges' own explorations of art, artifice, and reality.Critic Edna Aizenberg has noted that though Borges is often considered an author who focuses on \"irreality\" rather than social concerns, \"The Secret Miracle\" is firmly rooted in the Holocaust; Hlad\u00edk is arrested at the start of the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia and sentenced to death in large part for being Jewish. John Fraser reads the story as similarly rooted in historical concerns, arguing that Hladik gives a model of how art can be used to transcend contemporary geopolitical horrors."

Carefree, friendly and (rightfully so) self-proclaimed \"Tough guy\" (Korean: \uc388\ub188), Mori participates to the GOH tournament so that he can fight strong opponents and wish to be reunited with his grand-father Taejin. Later in the series, after the mystical \"Borrowed Power\" is introduced Mori is labeled as a Genuine Fighter meaning he uses martial arts to fight rather than borrowing power from other beings (one chapter shows that he actually borrowed power from his clone). However, the reason Mori is so powerful is due to his true identity of the mythical Jaechondaesong, or Sun Wukong, the hero of the Chinese Novel Journey to the West.\nAfter Ragnar\u00d6k, he assumes a new form and name via Dan Mori as a result of Park Mujin killing his grandfather and sealing his powers.Daewi Han (Korean: \ud55c\ub300\uc704, Han Daewi); (Japanese: \u30cf\u30f3\u30fb\u30c7\u30a4, Han Dei (anime))\n\nVoiced by: Kentar\u014d Kumagai (Japanese); Kwak Yoonsang (Korean); Sean Chiplock (English)\nA 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul, South Korea who practices Full-Contact Karate.

After being invited to the GOH tournament, he participates to cure his friend of the disease. After his friend's death, Daewi finds a new purpose in his life through his friendship with Mori and Mira and now wants to help them fulfill their dreams. A tall, lazy-looking young man with a loner personality, he is nonetheless fiercely loyal to his friends and willing to go to great lengths to protect them. His Borrowed Power is that of a Haetae, a Korean mythical creature with the ability to control water as a defensive tool or a weapon as well as augmenting attacks.\nAfter Ragnar\u00d6k, he has the Wisdom of the Sage, which allows him to manipulate gravity, electromagnetism, and even nature itself.

She initially joins the GOH Tournament in order to fulfill her wish of finding a suitable husband to carry on the school bloodline. Thanks to her friends Mori and Daewi, Mira let go of her family burden and will make a new path for herself. Mira's borrowed power is of an Ancient Chinese general named L\u00fc Bu, which is loosely based on the historical figure of the same name. This power gives her several abilities such as enhanced strength and the ability to summon a red horse (based on Red Hare, the legendary steed of L\u00fc Bu).\nAfter Ragnar\u00d6k, she becomes one of The Six and leader of Neo Nox, a merger of National Assembly of the Homeless and Sang Man-Duk's faction of Nox.

Ilpyo joined the tournament in order to wish for the recovery of his cousin, crippled during a martial arts competition against Taek Jegal.

Sold off as a baby by his mother to become the heir of the chairman of a large company, he grew up with a ''Might is right'' philosophy. Dubbed a monster by his opponents and team mates alike, Taek has an arrogant personality and extremely violent style of fighting, viewing everyone around him as insignificant trash. The only exception being the guardian of Ssamsu-Taekkyon, Ilpyo, his mortal enemy and the only person to defeat him years prior to the GOH tournament. Taek's Charyeok is characterized by \"Greed\", allowing him to absorb other fighter's powers.Taejin Jin (Korean: \uc9c4\ud0dc\uc9c4, Jin Taejin); (Japanese: \u30b8\u30f3\u30fb\u30c6\u30b8\u30f3, Jin Tejin (anime))\n\nVoiced by: Kazuhiro Yamaji (Japanese); Min Eung-Shik (Korean), Michael Sorich (English)\nThe adoptive grandfather of protagonist Mori. Probably the strongest Genuine Fighter of the series, Taejin is powerful enough to easily defeat gods by using his sole martial skills. His disdain for Borrowed Power and unlimited potential threaten the status quo between gods and humans and have made him the target of many secret organizations. He is the creator and only master of the fictional Renewal Taekwondo, whom he taught Mori. His disappearance serves as the main motivation for Mori to join the GOH tournament.Mujin Park (Korean: \ubc15\ubb34\uc9c4, Park Mujin); (Japanese: \u30d1\u30af\u30fb\u30e0\u30b8\u30f3, Paku Mujin (anime))\n\nVoiced by: Daisuke Namikawa (Japanese); Ryu Seung-Gon (Korean), Edward Bosco (English)\nMain antagonist of the manhwa. Member of the National Assembly of Korea, he is the figure in charge of the God of High School tournament. In the series, Mujin acts as a mastermind by laying out plans to achieve his goal of obtaining power in order to create a new world. Considered a prodigy and destined for greatness from a very young age, the best shaman in Korea even told him that he would become \"a king who will revolutionize the world\", setting the history of God Of High School into motion. His Borrowed Power is called \"Longinus\" which manifests as two yellow crosses appearing on each of Mujin's hands. The name Longinus is loosely based on the Roman soldier said to have pierced the side of Jesus during the Crucifixion. Longinus allows Mujin control over gravity and as a defensive shield. He commands a group of powerful humans specialized in Charyeok called commissioners or executives (Kor: \uc9d1\ud589\uc704\uc6d0). These figures are responsible for recruiting contestants and running the God of Highschool Tournament.Commissioner O (Korean: \uc9d1\ud589\uc704\uc6d0 O, Jibhaeng-Wiwon O); (Japanese: \u5be9\u5224\u54e1O, Shinpan-in O (anime))\n\nVoiced by: Yuki Kaida (Japanese); Kim Hyun-Wook (Korean);  Lucien Dodge (English)\nMember of the judges. Slightly shorter than the other executives, he has white, shoulder-length hair and dark-colored skin. O has won the first G.O.H tournament and, as such, is regarded by his colleagues as the strongest judge. His calm and perky character often makes him act as a mediator between the irritable R and the rash Q, often at each other's throat. He wields the Charyeok \"Dragon slayer\" which enables him to summon and command dragons as well as controlling fire. O is the one who recruited Mira for the G.O.H Tournament and appears fearful of the young woman, always avoiding eye contact with her and calling her \"a monster\". His true name is Sochun Yang.Commissioner P (Korean: \uc9d1\ud589\uc704\uc6d0 P, Jibhaeng-Wiwon P); (Japanese: \u5be9\u5224\u54e1P, Shinpan-in P (anime))\n\nVoiced by: Asami Tano (Japanese); Lee Mi-Na (Korean), Erika Harlacher (English)\nOnly female member of the judges, she acts a Mujin personal secretary, almost never leaving his side. P is a serious, dutiful and professional executive as well as caring of her colleagues. She is a tall, slim woman, wearing a female version of the Judge's uniform with blue hair tied in a bun. P uses the Charyeok \"Marionette\" to create \"dolls\" or copies of other people and be connected to them thus knowing and seeing what they know and see.Commissioner Q (Korean: \uc9d1\ud589\uc704\uc6d0 Q, Jibhaeng-Wiwon Q); (Japanese: \u5be9\u5224\u54e1Q, Shinpan-in Q (anime))\n\nVoiced by: Kenji Hamada (Japanese); Lee In-Suk (\uc774\uc778\uc11d) (Korean); Xander Mobus (English)\nMember of the judges. Recognizable by his tall stature, green hair and square glass. Q has a laid back if unorganized way of living his life, yet harbors an arrogant and act-before-thinking temper which often put him at odd with his boss and fellow commissioners. A running gag in the series is that whenever Q fights, his salary lessens. His Charyeok is \"Joker\", a scythe wielding jester-like entity he can summon with cards. Q recruited Daewi for the tournament and even trained him later on. He eventually married his student's older sister Daeryeong, with whom he has three kids.Commissioner R (Korean: \uc9d1\ud589\uc704\uc6d0 R, Jibhaeng-Wiwon R); (Japanese: \u5be9\u5224\u54e1R, Shinpan-in R (anime))\n\nVoiced by: Chikahiro Kobayashi (Japanese); Lee Jae-Beom (Korean), Lucien Dodge (English)\nMember of the judges. R is a tall, slender man and wears the typical Judge uniform. He has straight blonde hair going down his neck with narrow eyes that are often seen closed. Calm and collected, R is, like the other executives, proud of his strength. This makes him appear annoyed or vindictive when he is bested or doesn't get his way. R's Charyeok is unnamed and very unusual, as it enables him to forcibly take power from gods without their consent and control the wind. He was the one to recruit Mori for the tournament, inflicting the high-schooler his first defeat ever.Announcer/Commissioner T (Korean: \uc9d1\ud589\uc704\uc6d0 T, Jibhaeng-Wiwon T); (Japanese: \u5b9f\u6cc1T, Jikky\u014d T (anime))\n\nVoiced by: Tomokazu Seki (Japanese); Hwang Chang-Young (Korean), Edward Bosco (English)\nMember of the judge and the announcer of the GOH tournament. He has black spiky hair and orange sunglasses. Being himself blind, T also goes by the nickname Bongsa Sim, probably based on a blind character of a famous Korean Pansori story: Simcheongga. He has a long and pointed nose with shark-like teeth. Being a very skilled swordsman, T provides some advice to Mira for the tournament, even revealing he owes his blindness to an encounter with Mira's own family's sword style, Moonlight Sword. His true name is Jeongso Sim."

Kopelakis, which was docked in the yacht basin in the Hudson River at the World Financial Center. McWilliams cut the yardarm from the yacht with a K12 Saw and then took the flag and its pole from the yacht to an evacuation area on the northwest side of the site.  They found a pole about 20 feet (6.1 m) off the ground jutting from a pile of debris thought to have been from the grounds of the Marriott World Trade Center hotel, situated adjacent to the towers.Soon after its raising above Ground Zero, the flag disappeared. The city thought it had possession of the flag after the attack; Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and George Pataki signed it, and it flew at the New York City Hall, Yankee Stadium and on the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) during its service in the Mideast.However, when the flag's owner prepared to formally donate the flag, it was discovered that it was not the flag from Ground Zero. There was a size discrepancy: the yacht's flag measured 4 by 6 feet (1.2 m \u00d7 1.8 m), while the flag the city had measured 5 by 8 feet (1.5 m \u00d7 2.4 m). Dreifus started a website in an effort to get the flag back. A 2013 CNN documentary film, The Flag, directed by filmmakers Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein, investigated the mystery of this missing 9/11 icon and discovered video evidence that the flag went missing hours after it was first raised. \nThe original flag has now been recovered. The recovery came as a result of a lead gathered following the airing of the History Channel's Brad Meltzer's Lost History in 2014. A number of scientists have now verified that the flag is authentic, and it was unveiled on Sunday, September 11, 2016, the 15th anniversary of 9/11, on a History Channel special on the flag, America's 9/11 Flag: Rise From the Ashes."

However, around the time of the 20th anniversary of the film in 1996, Cohn revealed that it was actually a work of fiction.\nAfter persuading New York editor Clay Felker to let him write an article about the 1970s disco scene, Cohn, a newcomer to the United States, set about researching the American working-class subculture he was trying to cover. One night he travelled to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, to visit the disco 2001 Odyssey. However when he arrived a drunken fight was taking place outside the club, and one of the participants rolled over in the gutter and threw up on Cohn's trouser leg, leading him to return to Manhattan. Despite this brief visit, Cohn did notice that the scene was surveyed by one clubgoer standing in the doorway and calmly watching events. Cohn returned to the club subsequently but the young man was not there.To overcome his lack of familiarity with the New York disco scene, Cohn combined the image of the figure outside the club with people he knew from his youth, including a gang member from the Northern Ireland city of Derry, where Cohn had grown up, and a young man he knew in England. \"My story was a fraud\", he wrote. \"I'd only recently arrived in New York. Far from being steeped in Brooklyn street life, I hardly knew the place. As for Vincent, my story's hero, he was largely inspired by a Shepherd's Bush mod whom I'd known in the Sixties, a one-time king of Goldhawk Road.\" For additional detail Cohn returned to Bay Ridge during the day to get a better feel for the area.\nOn the 40th anniversary of the article\u2019s publication in 2016, Cohn said that he thought that such a fictionalised piece would not be published in the contemporary press:\nIt reads to me as obvious fiction, albeit based on observation and some knowledge of disco culture. No way could it sneak past customs now. In the 60s and 70s, the line between fact and fiction was blurry... Few editors asked tough questions. For the most part it was a case of \"don't ask, don't tell\".\n\n\n== References =="

He's also known for his intense shyness when he's out of character or without a script in front of him. When approached with a new role, he asks \"Who am I this time?\".

She stays in North Crawford, marries Harry a week later and they seem to be happy, depending on which play they're reading from that week.\nThe short story is written from the unnamed director's point of view."

        "content": "Endicott and his Puritan followers suppress freedom and individuality, a common theme for Hawthorne. At the beginning of the story \"jollity\" and \"gloom\" are said to be contending for an empire, the Merry Mount colonists personifying jollity or mirth and the Puritans being the emblems of gloom. Hawthorne satirizes both parties and the narrative point of view seems to oscillate between them. It is perhaps worth noting that Hawthorne chooses to use \"jollity\", \"mirth\" and \"gloom\" and not \"joy\", \"woe\" or \"sadness\". Real joy, Hawthorne seems to be saying, arises spontaneously out of contrasts. The only time he mentions it is when the youth and maiden suddenly realise that their mirth is visionary and that by truly loving they had subjected themselves \"to earth's doom of care and sorrow, and troubled joy, and had no more a home at Merry Mount\". The youth and maiden go from being Merry Mounters to, presumably, becoming members of the Puritan community. In this sense it is not clear whether Hawthorne actually sides with the Puritans or the Merry Mount people, or if he is trying to find some middle ground.\nBy his ambiguous point of view and use of allegory, Hawthorne seems to be trying to focus the readers' attention on the fact that certain aspects of the American past were already shrouded and obscured by myth. It is not too difficult to see the Merry Mounters as the precursors of hippies (Beats, or, perhaps, more accurately free thinkers) or the Puritans as the archetype of the establishment. Hawthorne goes against the tradition of casting America as a promised land where people came to act out their dreams or to possess it by portraying both the Puritans and the Merry Mounters as a persecuted minority who sought refuge in the new land.\nBeing a descendant of the  earliest arrivals who were seeking freedom over 200 years before, Hawthorne must have known well the stories that typically lie behind official tales, such as those that we find from William Bradford, John Endicott, John Winthrop, and others. His insight about the interplay of personal freedom and family, or civic, responsibility continues to resonate today. As Nathaniel knew then, these matters of choice, such as whether 'strong watter' leads, by necessity, to debauchery or not, are perpetual issues readdressed with each generation. And he is critical of Merry Mount, suggesting that the Puritan critique of feckless pleasure-seeking has substantial truth, even if the Puritans themselves are a little heavy-handed."

They sought an injunction to force the Board to give them absentee ballots, and the Board sought to dismiss the lawsuit, saying that giving them the ballots would be a crime under Illinois law.\nAccording to the plaintiffs' argument, there was no good reason for Illinois to discriminate between those it already gave absentee ballots to - including people who might be in jails in counties other than their home county - while not giving ballots to them. Although a state could choose who it gave absentee ballots to, it could not \"unreasonably and arbitrarily discriminate\".On March 30, the District Court granted a temporary order for the inmates to be given ballots, but after a hearing, they granted summary judgment for the Board on December 11. First, it agreed with the Board's interpretation of the state, restricting \"physical incapacity\" to mean incapacity for medical reasons. Then, considering the constitutional question, it compared the Illinois law to three other cases where state laws about absentee ballot had been upheld. In the 1916 case Straughan v. Meyers, a Missouri law was upheld that granted absentee ballots to people traveling for work (e.g. railroad employees, traveling salesmen), but not others. In the 1936 case Lemons v. Noller, a Kansas law was upheld that granted absentee ballots to those who would be outside the state, even though physically disabled person inside the state could not get one. And in the 1963 case Hallahan v. Mittlebeeler, a Kentucky law was upheld that granted absentee ballots to those absent from their county who were \"in the United States services, or bona fide, full time student[s],\" but not others absent from their county. Finding Illinois's rules to be no more unreasonable than these other examples, the Court ruled in favor of the Board. McDonald and Byrd appealed directly to the Supreme Court."

        "content": "Tsukune Aono is an average teenager who is unable to get into any local high schools due to his poor grades. As a last-ditch effort to secure his education, his parents enroll him in a private school called Yokai Academy, which he discovers is a boarding school for monsters. The school teaches monsters how to coexist with humans, including disguising them as them, but any real humans found on campus are to be killed. Although he fears for his life, Tsukune befriends a beautiful vampire girl named Moka Akashiya, who enjoys his company and especially the taste of his blood. During a fight with a school bully, Tsukune accidentally removes the rosario around Moka's neck and discovers that she transforms into a powerful vampire with a completely different personality.\nBecause of Moka, Tsukune decides to stay at Yokai. He befriends formerly antagonistic students, including succubus Kurumu Kurono and child prodigy witch Yukari Sendo. They join the school's Newspaper Club and wind up fighting a variety of students and teachers, who use their monstrous powers to bully or to control one or more of the members for their own selfish or destructive ends. On a club trip to the human world, they meet a witch, Ruby Tojo, who defends a field of sunflowers from being torn down by developers. They meet Mizore Shirayuki, a snow fairy student who becomes Tsukune's \"stalker\". A group of \"Monstrels\" harass the club. Ruby, having recovered from injuries, joins the school's staff as the Headmaster's assistant. An evil group called the Anti-Schoolers threaten to break down the barrier between the human and monster worlds. When Tsukune's cousin manages to sneak onto the school grounds, the club has a hard time keeping the monster school a secret. When the school is temporarily closed because of damage, Tsukune returns home to the human world only to have Moka, Kurumu, Yukari, and Mizore follow him and hide in his room.\nIn Rosario+Vampire: Season II, Moka's younger half-sister Koko Shuzen enrolls. She, Ruby, and Mizore join the Newspaper Club. On an excursion to Mizore's homeland, they learn of a dangerous organization called Fairy Tale, which seeks to destroy the human world. The Newspaper Club visits the human world where they meet San Otonashi, a former club member, and run into trouble with adversaries from Fairy Tale's 7th Branch office. Chinese transfer student Fangfang Huang tries to recruit Tsukune to join his mafia family. When Moka spends a school day as her inner personality, she is unable to return to the seal, so the Newspaper Club heads to China to get her Rosario fixed.\nIn Hong Kong, Tsukune and the gang learn the truth about Moka's identity: she was infused with First Ancestor blood by her mother Akasha Bloodriver, who sacrificed herself to protect them from Alucard, the original First Ancestor vampire. Moka's eldest half-sister Aqua infiltrates the Huang manor and captures Moka to bring to Fairy Tale, which suspects that Moka is the key to reviving Alucard. While his friends train their powers, Tsukune has his body altered by Tohofuhai to handle the upcoming challenges.\nTsukune and the gang infiltrate the Hanging Garden: a sky fortress that serves as Fairy Tale's headquarters. They face opposition from their leader and matriarch of the Shuzen family Gyokuro Shuzen, who sends the leaders of the Fairy Tale Branches after them for a series of fights. The group eventually reaches Moka, but must face her half-sisters Aqua and Kalua. Gyokuro snatches Moka's rosario in order to control Alucard. A character called the Masked King reveals himself to be a clone of Alucard's original vampire form. He reveals that he has manipulated both Fairy Tale and its opposition to determine whether the rosario could control him, and then merges with his monster self, who goes on a rampage in Tokyo.\nMoka is mortally wounded, but Tsukune revives her by removing all his holy locks and transforming himself into a First Ancestor vampire. They beat down Alucard, but he revives and reveals that he has hatched eggs in Japan's major cities. Tsukune's friends and allies, along with the two other Dark Lords, band together to fight Alucard and his clones. Tsukune puts Moka's rosario on Alucard, which awakens Akasha inside his monster body. Akasha tells Alucard to give up the fight, and they cast a self-disintegration spell. Now that the existence of monsters is known in the human world, coexistence is now even harder to achieve; however, Tsukune is confident that he and his friends can do it."

His first character design was Moka, a beautiful girl vampire with a crucifix around her neck; he then created the school of monsters and Tsukune afterwards.

        "content": "The story follows Thomas Chandler, or \"Little Chandler\" as he is known, through a portion of his day. The story drops the reader into Little Chandler's life when he is at work, where he cannot focus because he is preoccupied with the thought of a visit later that day. He anxiously awaits this visit with his old friend Ignatius Gallaher. Gallaher is now a \"brilliant figure\" in the London Press and Little Chandler has not seen him in eight years. As Little Chandler thinks about his old friend and the success that has come to him, he begins to reflect upon his own life. This reflection gives the reader insight to Little Chandler's character. The reader sees Little Chandler as a mere observer of life, a reluctant character. He is timid, because he enjoys poetry yet is too \"shy\" to read it to his wife.Little Chandler likes to think that he himself could have been a writer if only he had put his mind to it. All of the \"different moods and impressions he wished to express in verse\" could still be achieved if he could just express himself. But as much as Little Chandler covers up his true feelings with these thoughts that seem to \"comfort\" him, the reader can see past this.\nThese feelings are more clearly exposed to the reader in the bar where Little Chandler actually meets Gallaher. Here, Gallaher tells enchanting stories of his vast traveling. His life is the exact opposite of Little Chandler's and Little Chandler begins to feel that his wife is holding him back from success as a result of Gallaher's glorification of his travels and freedoms. Without his wife, without his little boy, he would be free to prosper. Deep envy sets into Little Chandler. It seems as though the more they drink, and the longer they talk, the more inferior Chandler feels. Still, he tries to hide his envy of Gallaher's life by saying how one day Gallaher will get married and start a family too.\nJoyce shifts the scene to Little Chandler's home. We find Little Chandler with his child in his arms. He is sitting at a table looking at a picture of his wife, Annie. He looks into her eyes searching for answers to his now confused state of mind. All he finds is coldness. He sees a pretty girl, but he can see no life in her, and he compares her unfavourably to the rich, exotic women Gallaher says are available to him. He wonders why he married Annie. He then opens a book of Byron's poetry and begins to read until the child begins to cry and Little Chandler finds he cannot comfort him. Little Chandler snaps at his son. The frightened baby cries harder and harder until Annie comes. Through her interaction with Little Chandler and the child, it becomes apparent that Little Chandler is not her main priority.\nLittle Chandler feels trapped. All feelings of hope that existed at the beginning of the day are now gone. It is at this moment that Little Chandler reaches a deep moment of recognition. He finally sees the truth that the reader has known all along. His own reluctance is the only thing responsible for his feelings of incompleteness, and he can now only blame himself. Tears come to Little Chandler's eyes, and the story is cut off."

        "content": "In an analysis of \"A Little Cloud\", Harold Mosher wrote that, in Dubliners, Joyce uses, and perhaps abuses, both repetition and clich\u00e9 in order to give the writing a feel of insignificance. He pointed out there is a legitimate lack of action in many of the stories, certainly in \"A Little Cloud\", and this \"content of lack\" is mirrored by the language Joyce used. Mosher believes the talking about nothing, in the way that many Joyce characters do, is actually rather important, and argued that, in terms of the language, this style actually portrays an abundance of creativity and quality, rather than the lack of fresh thought that could be implied by the clich\u00e9 nature of the writing. Thematically, Mosher said this is important in an ironic way, because, though it shows creativity on the part of Joyce, it shows little on the part of Chandler: he thinks and speaks in this way because, as he says in the end to Annie, he \"couldn\u2019t... didn't do anything.\"It\u2019s been remarked that \u201ca central theme\u201d of Dubliners is expressed in Little Chandler\u2019s conclusion that \u201cIf you wanted to succeed you had to go away.\u201d"

It was originally published in Strand Magazine in February 1892.\n\"The Speckled Band\" is a classic locked-room mystery that deals with the themes of parental greed, inheritance and freedom. Tinged with Gothic elements, it is considered by many to be one of Doyle's finest works, with the author himself calling it his best story. The story, alongside the rest of the Sherlock Holmes canon, has become a defining part of detective fiction. It has been adapted for television, film, theatre, radio and a video game. It is part of the exhibit at the Sherlock Holmes Museum. The theatrical adaptation was written and produced by Doyle himself, directed by and starring Lyn Harding as Grimesby Roylott. The role of Holmes was played by H. A. Saintsbury. Doyle famously clashed with Harding over several details of the script, but later reconciled with him after the universal success of the play."

        "content": "In April 1883, Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson rise early one morning to meet a young woman named Helen Stoner, who fears that her stepfather, Dr Grimesby Roylott, is threatening her life. She explains that Roylott is a violent doctor of great physical strength who practised in Calcutta, India; is the impoverished sole survivor of a wealthy but ill-tempered and amoral aristocratic Anglo-Saxon family in Surrey; and was married to Helen's late mother, a wealthy widow, 30 years prior. After serving time in an Indian prison for killing his Indian butler in a rage, Roylott had moved to England to reestablish his practice, but retired after his wife was killed in a railway accident eight years prior.\nFurthermore, Helen's twin sister Julia died two years prior, shortly before her wedding day. Despite hearing her last words, \"The speckled band!\", Helen cannot make sense of them. Now that she is engaged, she has also begun hearing strange noises and observing strange activities around her heavily mortgaged countryside home of Stoke Moran, which Roylott has made extensive modifications to even before Julia's death. Of particular note, he is having an outside wall repaired, forcing Helen to move into the room where Julia died.\nAfter Holmes agrees to take the case, he is visited by Roylott, who threatens to harm him if he interferes. Undaunted, Holmes leaves for the courthouse to examine Helen's mother's will before joining Watson in traveling to Stoke Moran, where he scrutinizes the premises. Within Helen's room, he discovers her bed is anchored to the floor, an unconnected bell cord has been installed, and a ventilator hole connects her room to Roylott's. Holmes and Watson arrange to stay the night in Helen's room.\nAt three a.m., a slight metallic noise and a dim light through the ventilator prompts Holmes to light a candle. He soon sees the \"speckled band\", a venomous snake, on the bell cord and strikes at it with his riding crop. Agitated, it flees back through the ventilator and kills Roylott, who had sent it to kill Helen and was awaiting its return. Holmes identifies the snake as an Indian swamp adder and reveals to Watson the will initially provided an annual income of \u00a31,100 before dropping to \u00a3750 sterling when she died, of which her daughters could claim one-third upon marriage. Desiring all of the income for himself, Roylott schemed to murder his daughters. Though Holmes also admits to indirectly killing Roylott, he does not foresee it troubling him and chooses not to tell the police Roylott's full motive to spare Helen any further grief."

In the article, a captain tells how he was dispatched to a remote camp in West Africa to stay in a tumbledown cabin that belonged to a Portuguese trader. On the first night in the cabin, he is awoken by a creaking sound, and sees \"a dark queer-looking thing hanging down through the ventilator above it\". It turns out to be the largest Boa constrictor he has seen (more likely a python because there are no boas in Africa). He is paralysed with fear as the serpent comes down into the room. Unable to cry out for help, the captain spots an old bell that hung from a projecting beam above one of the windows.

Her father was a wholesaler of chemical products and machine oils.\nShortly after the death of her father in 1905, she met painter, puppet-maker and caricaturist Albert Schlopsnies. The son of a Protestant landowner from East Prussia, he studied at the Munich Art Academy with Gabriel von Hackl from 1903. On 15 September 1910 in Frankfurt Franziska married Albert, who was by then employed as a freelancer at Margarete Steiff GmbH, for which he designed catalogs and numerous dolls and stuffed animals. In 1913, Franziska and Albert moved to Munich and settled in the Schwabing district. In May 1915 their daughter Irmgard Erika was born.\nAfter World War I, Franziska Schlopsnies began designing posters for fashion shows, department stores and exhibitions. One of her earliest surviving designs was made in 1920 for the Tietz department store. After the couple's divorce on 18 December 1922 she often signed her designs with the name \"Slopsnies\". From the mid-1920s, she preferred to draw figurines and costumes. Along with Doris Buscher, Liliane and Margaret von Suttner she was considered among the most important fashion illustrators. Her Art Deco-inspired fashion drawings and caricatures were regularly published in magazines, such as Jugend, Simplicissimus, Eleganten Welt, Berliner Illustrirten Zeitung, Sport im Bild and the monthly Velhagen & Klasings Monatshefte. For the satirical periodicals Fliegende Bl\u00e4tter and Meggendorfer-Bl\u00e4tter, she designed numerous covers in the second half of the 1920s.After Adolf Hitler's rise to power, she produced no known published drawings. To secure her livelihood and that of her daughter, she rented some rooms in her apartment to students. Both her sisters and her mother succeeded in emigrating, while Franziska could have been at first spared deportation because she was the mother of a daughter who, by the definition of the National Socialists, was a \"Mischling [person of Jewish mixed race] of the first degree\". Regarding the date of her deportation, the record is contradictory. She was deported in 1943 or January 1944 with an unknown destination. On 30 December 1944 Franziska Schlopsnies died in the concentration camp Auschwitz. Her daughter Erika survived World War II and emigrated to the United States in 1946.\nToday at international auctions Franziska Schlopsnies' graphics and prints reach prices of up to several thousand Euros."

It was serialized in Shogakukan's Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday from September 1978 to February 1987. Its 366 individual chapters were collected in 34 tank\u014dbon volumes. It tells the story of Ataru Moroboshi, and the alien Lum, who believes she is Ataru's wife after he accidentally proposes to her. The series makes heavy use of Japanese mythology, culture, and puns. It was adapted into an anime television series produced by Kitty Films and broadcast on Fuji TV affiliates from October 1981 to March 1986, with 194 half-hour episodes. Twelve OVAs and six theatrical films followed, and the series was released on various home video formats.\nThe manga series was republished in different formats in Japan. Viz Media released the series in North America in the 1990s under the names Lum * Urusei Yatsura and The Return of Lum, but dropped it after eight issues. They re-licensed the manga and released an omnibus edition under its original title with new translations from 2019 to 2023. The television series, OVAs, and five of the films were released in North America with English subtitles, as well as a dub for the films by AnimEigo. They provided extensive notes on the series to allow people to understand the many cultural references and jokes in the series that would not normally be understood by non-Japanese. The remaining film, Beautiful Dreamer, was released bilingually by Central Park Media. Five of the films, as well as the OVAs, are available from MVM Films in the United Kingdom. The series was released on television in Southeast Asia as Lamu the Invader Girl. The series and films have been license rescued by Discotek Media for a Blu-ray release. A second anime television series adaptation of 46 episodes produced by David Production premiered on Fuji TV's Noitamina programming block in October 2022, exactly 41 years after the first premiered. That series is licensed by Sentai Filmworks and streamed on Hidive.\nUrusei Yatsura launched Takahashi's career and received positive reception in and out of Japan from fans and critics alike. The manga has over 35 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. In 1980, it received the 26th Shogakukan Manga Award in the sh\u014dnen category, as well as the 18th Seiun Award for the Best Comic category in 1987."

        "content": "An alien race known as the Oni arrive on Earth to invade the planet. Instead of taking over the planet by force, the Oni give humans a chance to fight for the rights to the planet by taking part in a competition. The competition is a variant of the game of tag (known as \"the game of the Oni\" in Japanese), in which the human player must touch the horns on the head of the Oni player within one week. The computer-selected human player is Ataru Moroboshi, a lecherous, unlucky and academically unsuccessful high school student from the fictional Tomobiki Town (\u53cb\u5f15\u753a) in Nerima, Japan, and the Oni player is Lum, daughter of the leader of the alien invaders. Despite his initial reluctance to take part in the competition, Ataru becomes interested in the game when he meets Lum. When the competition begins, Lum surprises everyone by flying away and Ataru finds himself unable to catch her. Before the last day of the competition, Ataru's girlfriend Shinobu Miyake encourages Ataru by pledging to marry him if he wins. On the final day of the competition, Ataru wins the game by stealing Lum's bikini top, which prevents her from protecting her horns in favor of protecting her modesty. In celebrating his victory, Ataru expresses his joy at being able to get married; however, Lum misinterprets this as a proposal from Ataru and accepts on the competition's worldwide live television broadcast. Despite the misunderstanding, Lum falls in love with Ataru and moves into his house.\nDespite Ataru's lack of interest in Lum and attempts to rekindle his relationship with Shinobu, Lum frequently interferes and Shinobu loses interest in Ataru. Still, Ataru's flirtatious nature persists despite Lum's attention. Lum attempts to stop him from flirting, which results in Ataru receiving powerful electric shock attacks from Lum as punishment. Two characteristics of Ataru are particularly strong: his pervertedness and his bad luck that draws to him all bizarre residents of the planet, the spirit world and even the galaxy. Later Lum begins attending the same school as Ataru despite his objections. Lum develops a fan base of admirers among the boys of the school, including Shutaro Mendo, the rich and handsome heir to a large corporation that all the girls from Tomobiki have a crush on. Despite their romantic interest, none of Lum's admirers will risk upsetting Lum by trying to force her and Ataru apart, although this does not stop them from trying to get Ataru punished due to his bad behavior, and interfering every time the two get close."

        "content": "In 1977, Rumiko Takahashi created the short story Those Selfish Aliens that was nominated for Shogakukan's Best New Comic Artist award. This would serve as the basis for creating Urusei Yatsura which was first published a year later when Takahashi was 21 years old. The series was her first major work, having previously only published short stories and is a combination of romantic comedy, science fiction, suburban life, and Japanese folktales. The title of the series is an untranslatable pun on the word urusai (\u3046\u308b\u3055\u3044), meaning \"noisy\" or \"obnoxious\", but written with the Chinese character for \"planet\"; the title can be translated roughly into English as \"Those Obnoxious Aliens\". The series first appeared in Shogakukan's Weekly Shonen Sunday in September 1978. At the start of the series it was only scheduled to run for 5 chapters. Ataru was the central character and each chapter would feature a different strange character. The character of Lum was only going to appear in the first chapter and was not in the second chapter; however, Takahashi decided to re-include her in the third chapter. The series was not an instant success and chapters were initially published sporadically. Between May and September 1978 she simultaneously worked on a series called Dust Spot; however, the increasing popularity of Urusei Yatsura caused her to focus on Urusei and the series became a regular serialization from the middle of 1979.Takahashi said that she had been dreaming about the overall universe of Urusei Yatsura since she was very young. She said that the series \"really includes everything I ever wanted to do. I love science fiction because sci-fi has tremendous flexibility. I adopted the science fiction-style for the series because then I could write any way I wanted to\". She wanted the reader to be completely surprised by the next panel and used slapstick comedy to create a reaction in the reader. When Takahashi ran out of ideas she would create new characters. Takahashi shared a small 150-square-foot apartment with her assistants, and slept in a closet due to a lack of space. While writing Urusei Yatsura she also began work on Maison Ikkoku and used this experience as well as her university experience as the basis for the setting of that series. Character names often carry extra meanings used to describe a characters personality or other traits. For example, the name Ataru Moroboshi refers to being hit by a star, a reference to the aliens and other people who gather around him. The name Shinobu suggests a patient character; however, this in contrast to the character's actual personality. In a similar way, the setting for the series is \"Tomobiki\", which means \"friend taking\". Tomobiki is also the name of a superstitious day in the old Japanese calendar system considered to have \"no winners or losers\" and occurred on every sixth day. Funerals rarely took place on this day as it was believed more deaths would soon follow. Lum was named after Agnes Lum, a bikini model during the 1970s. Lum's use of the English word \"Darling\" in reference to Ataru was to emphasize her status as a foreigner, as well as a play on the name Darrin, the husband figure from Bewitched.The characters of Megane, Perm, Kakugari and Chibi are recurring characters throughout the first anime adaptation; however, in the manga they are nameless fans of Lum who appear less after Mendo is introduced. In contrast the character Kosuke Shirai plays a large role in the manga, but does not appear in the first anime series. His role is often performed by Perm. The second half of the first anime adaptation is closer to the manga than the first half. In 2022, Takahashi said that Urusei Yatsura ended because she saw that Shinobu was happy after the character Inaba had been introduced. Takahashi has stated that she will not produce any more content for the series."

Examples of literature and folklore include The Tale of Genji and Urashima Tar\u014d. Many of the characters in the series are derived from mythological creatures. In some cases the creatures themselves appeared, and in other cases a character was designed to incorporate the characteristics of a mythological creature.Stories and situations made use of these mythological elements to create jokes and draw comparisons with the original mythology. For example, the Oni choose tag to decide their contest with Earth because the Japanese word for Tag, Onigokko, means \"game of the Oni\". When Ataru grabs Lum's horns during their contest and she misunderstands his statement that he can get married, it is a reference to the myth that grabbing the horns of an Oni will make your dream come true."

        "content": "\"O Captain! My Captain!\" is an extended metaphor poem written by Walt Whitman in 1865 about the death of U.S. president Abraham Lincoln. Well received upon publication, the poem was Whitman's first to be anthologized and the most popular during his lifetime. Together with \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\", \"Hush'd Be the Camps To-day\", and \"This Dust was Once the Man\", it is one of four poems written by Whitman about the death of Lincoln.\nDuring the American Civil War, Whitman moved to Washington, D.C., where he worked for the government and volunteered at hospitals. Although he never met Lincoln, Whitman felt a connection to him and was greatly moved by Lincoln's assassination. \"My Captain\" was first published in The Saturday Press on November 4, 1865, and appeared in Sequel to Drum-Taps later that year. He later included it in the collection Leaves of Grass and recited the poem at several lectures on Lincoln's death.\nStylistically, the poem is uncharacteristic of Whitman's poetry because of its rhyming, song-like flow, and simple \"ship of state\" metaphor. These elements likely contributed to the poem's initial positive reception and popularity, with many celebrating it as one of the greatest American works of poetry. Critical opinion has shifted since the mid-20th century, with some scholars deriding it as conventional and unoriginal. The poem has made several appearances in popular culture; as it never mentions Lincoln, it has been invoked upon the death of several other heads of state. It is famously featured in Dead Poets Society (1989) and is frequently associated with the star of that film, Robin Williams."

        "content": "Walt Whitman established his reputation as a poet in the late 1850s to early 1860s with the 1855 release of Leaves of Grass. Whitman intended to write a distinctly American epic and developed a free verse style inspired by the cadences of the King James Bible. The brief volume, first released in 1855, was considered controversial by some, with critics particularly objecting to Whitman's blunt depictions of sexuality and the poem's \"homoerotic overtones\". Whitman's work received significant attention following praise for Leaves of Grass by American transcendentalist lecturer and essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson.At the start of the American Civil War, Whitman moved from New York to Washington, D.C., where he held a series of government jobs\u2014first with the Army Paymaster's Office and later with the Bureau of Indian Affairs. He volunteered in the army hospitals as a nurse. Whitman's poetry was informed by his wartime experience, maturing into reflections on death and youth, the brutality of war, and patriotism. Whitman's brother, Union Army soldier George Washington Whitman, was taken prisoner in Virginia in September 1864, and held for five months in Libby Prison, a Confederate prisoner-of-war camp near Richmond. On February 24, 1865, George was granted a furlough to return home because of his poor health, and Whitman travelled to his mother's home in New York to visit his brother. While visiting Brooklyn, Whitman contracted to have his collection of Civil War poems, Drum-Taps, published. In June 1865, James Harlan, the Secretary of the Interior, found a copy of Leaves of Grass and, considering the collection vulgar, fired Whitman from the Bureau of Indian Affairs."

        "content": "Literary critic Helen Vendler thinks it likely that Whitman wrote the poem before \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\", considering it a direct response to \"Hush'd Be the Camps To-Day\". An early draft of the poem is written in free verse. \"My Captain\" was first published in The Saturday Press on November 4, 1865. Around the same time, it was included in Whitman's book, Sequel to Drum-Taps\u2014publication in The Saturday Press was considered a \"teaser\" for the book. Although Sequel to Drum-Taps was first published in early October 1865, the copies were not ready for distribution until December. The first publication of the poem had different punctuation than Whitman intended, and he corrected before its next publication. It was also included in the 1867 edition of Leaves of Grass. Whitman revised the poem several times during his life, including in his 1871 collection Passage to India. Its final republication by Whitman was in the 1881 edition of Leaves of Grass.Whitman's friend Horace Traubel wrote in his book With Walt Whitman in Camden that Whitman read a newspaper article that said \"If Walt Whitman had written a volume of My Captains instead of filling a scrapbasket with waste and calling it a book the world would be better off today and Walt Whitman would have some excuse for living.\" Whitman responded to the article on September 11, 1888, saying: \"Damn My Captain [...] I'm almost sorry I ever wrote the poem,\" though he admitted that it \"had certain emotional immediate reasons for being\". In the 1870s and 1880s, Whitman gave several lectures over eleven years on Lincoln's death. He usually began or ended the lectures by reciting \"My Captain\", despite his growing prominence meaning he could have read a different poem. In the late 1880s, Whitman earned money by selling autographed copies of \"My Captain\"\u2014purchasers included John Hay, Charles Aldrich, and S. Weir Mitchell."

        "content": "The poem rhymes using an AABBCDED rhyme scheme, and is designed for recitation. It is written in nine quatrains, organized in three stanzas. Each stanza has two quatrains of four seven-beat lines, followed by a four-line refrain, which changes slightly from stanza to stanza, in a tetrameter/trimeter ballad beat. Historian Daniel Mark Epstein wrote in 2004 that he considers the structure of the poem to be \"uncharacteristically mechanical, formulaic\". He goes on to describe the poem as a conventional ballad, comparable to Samuel Taylor Coleridge's writing in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" and much of Alfred, Lord Tennyson's work, especially \"In Memoriam A.H.H.\" Literary critic Jerome Loving wrote to the opposite effect in 1999, saying that the structure gave \"My Captain\" a \"sing-song\" quality, evocative of folk groups like the Hutchinson Family Singers and Cheney Family Singers. The scholar Ted Genoways argued that the poem retains distinctive features characteristic to Whitman, such as varying line length. Whitman very rarely wrote poems that rhymed; in a review contemporary to Whitman, The Atlantic suggested that Whitman was rising \"above himself\" by writing a poem unlike his others. The writer elaborated that, while his previous work had represented \"unchecked nature\", the rhymes of \"My Captain\" were a sincere expression of emotion.The author Frances Winwar argued in her 1941 book American Giant: Walt Whitman and His Times that \"in the simple ballad rhythm beat the heart of the folk\". Vendler concludes that Whitman's use of a simple style is him saying that \"soldiers and sailors have a right to verse written for them\". Using elements of popular poetry enabled Whitman to create a poem that he felt would be understood by the general public. In 2009, academic Amanda Gailey argued that Whitman\u2014who, writing the poem, had just been fired from his government job\u2014adopted a conventional style to attract a wider audience. She added that Whitman wrote to heal the nation, crafting a poem the country would find \"ideologically and aesthetically satisfactory\". William Pannapacker, a literature professor, similarly described the poem in 2004 as a \"calculated critical and commercial success\". In 2003, the author Daniel Aaron wrote that \"Death enshrined the Commoner [Lincoln], [and] Whitman placed himself and his work in the reflected limelight\". As an elegy to Lincoln, the English professor Faith Barrett wrote in 2005 that the style makes it \"timeless\", following in the tradition of elegies like \"Lycidas\" and \"Adonais\"."

        "content": "The poem was Whitman's most popular during his lifetime, and the only one to be anthologized before his death. The historian Michael C. Cohen noted that \"My Captain\" was \"carried beyond the limited circulation of Leaves of Grass and into the popular heart\"; its popularity remade \"history in the form of a ballad\". Initial reception to the poem was very positive. In early 1866, a reviewer in the Boston Commonwealth wrote that the poem was the most moving dirge for Lincoln ever written, adding that Drum Taps \"will do much [...] to remove the prejudice against Mr. Whitman in many minds\". Similarly, after reading Sequel to Drum Taps, the author William Dean Howells became convinced that Whitman had cleaned the \"old channels of their filth\" and poured \"a stream of blameless purity\" through; he would become a prominent defender of Whitman. One of the earliest criticisms of the poem was authored by Edward P. Mitchell in 1881 who considered the rhymes \"crude\". \"My Captain\" is considered uncharacteristic of Whitman's poetry, and it was praised initially as a departure from his typical style. Author Julian Hawthorne wrote in 1891 that the poem was touching partially because it was such a stylistic departure. In 1892, The Atlantic wrote that \"My Captain\" was universally accepted as Whitman's \"one great contribution to the world's literature\", and George Rice Carpenter, a scholar and biographer of Whitman, said in 1903 that the poem was possibly the best work of Civil War poetry, praising its imagery as \"beautiful\".Reception remained positive into the early 20th century. Epstein considers it to have been one of the ten most popular English language poems of the 20th century. In his book Canons by Consensus, Joseph Csicsila reached a similar conclusion, noting that the poem was \"one of the two or three most highly praised of Whitman's poems during the 1920s and 1930s\"; he also wrote that the poem's verse form and emotional sincerity appealed to \"more conservative-minded critics\". In 1916, Henry B. Rankin, a biographer of Lincoln, wrote that \"My Captain\" became \"the nation's\u2014aye, the world's\u2014funeral dirge of our First American\". The Literary Digest in 1919 deemed it the \"most likely to live forever\" of Whitman's poems, and the 1936 book American Life in Literature went further, describing it as the best American poem. Author James O'Donnell Bennett echoed that, writing that the poem represented a perfect \"threnody\", or mourning poem. The poem was not unanimously praised during this period: one critic wrote that \"My Captain\" was \"more suitable for recitation before an enthusiastically uncritical audience than for its place in the Oxford Book of English Verse\".Beginning in the 1920s, Whitman became increasingly respected by critics, and by 1950 he was one of the most prominent American authors. Poetry anthologies began to include poetry that was considered more \"authentic\" to Whitman's poetic style, and, as a result, \"My Captain\" became less popular. In an analysis of poetry anthologies, Joseph Csicsila found that, although \"My Captain\" had been Whitman's most frequently published poem, shortly after the end of World War II it \"all but disappeared\" from American anthologies, and had \"virtually disappeared\" after 1966. William E. Barton wrote in Abraham Lincoln and Walt Whitman, published in 1965, that the poem was \"the least like Whitman of anything Whitman ever wrote; yet it is his highest literary monument\".Critical opinion of the poem began to shift in the middle of the 20th century. In 1980, Whitman's biographer Justin Kaplan called the poem \"thoroughly conventional\". The literary critic F. O. Matthiessen criticized the poem, writing in 1941 that its early popularity was an \"ample and ironic comment\" on how Whitman's more authentic poetry could not reach a wide audience. Michael C. Cohen, a literature professor, said Matthiessen's writing exemplified 20th-century opinion on the poem. In the 1997 book A Reader's Guide to Walt Whitman, scholar Gay Wilson Allen concluded that the poem's symbols were \"trite\", the rhythm \"artificial\", and the rhymes \"erratic\".Negative perspectives on the poem continued into the 21st century. In 2000, Helen Vendler wrote that because Whitman \"was bent on registering individual response as well as the collective wish expressed in 'Hush'd be the camps', he took on the voice of a single representative sailor silencing his own idiosyncratic voice\". Elsewhere, she states that two \"stylistic features\u2014its meter and its use of refrain\u2014mark 'O Captain' as a designedly democratic and populist poem\". Four years later, Epstein wrote that he struggled to believe that the same writer wrote both \"Lilacs\" and \"O Captain! My Captain!\". Poet Robert Pinsky told the New York Times News Service in 2009 that he considered the poem \"not very good\", and a year later another poet, C. K. Williams, concluded that the poem was a \"truly awful piece of near doggerel triteness\" that deserved derisive criticism. Meanwhile, the 2004 Oxford Encyclopedia of American Literature entry on Whitman suggests that critiques about the poem's rhythm are unfair."

Vendler writes that the poem utilizes elements of war journalism, such as \"the bleeding drops of red\" and \"fallen cold and dead\". The poem has imagery relating to the sea throughout. Genoways considers the best \"turn of phrase\" in the poem to be line 12, where Whitman describes a \"swaying mass\", evocative of both a funeral and religious service.The poem's nautical references allude to Admiral Nelson's death at the Battle of Trafalgar."

        "content": "The poem, which never mentions Lincoln by name, has frequently been invoked following the deaths of a head of state. After Franklin D. Roosevelt died in 1945, actor Charles Laughton read \"O Captain! My Captain!\" during a memorial radio broadcast. When John F. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, \"O Captain! My Captain!\" was played on many radio stations, extending the 'ship of state' metaphor to Kennedy. \nFollowing the 1995 assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the poem was translated into Hebrew and put to music by Naomi Shemer.The poem was set to music by David Broza and the song was released on his album Stone Doors. The poem was also set to music by Kurt Weill as one of his \"Four Walt Whitman Songs\".The poem appears in the 1989 American film Dead Poets Society. John Keating (played by Robin Williams), an English teacher at the Welton Academy boarding school, introduces his students to the poem in their first class. Keating is later fired from the school. As Keating returns to collect his belongings, the students stand on their desks and address Keating as \"O Captain! My Captain!\" The use of \"My Captain\" in the film was considered \"ironic\" by Cohen because the students are taking a stand against \"repressive conformity\" but using a poem intentionally written to be conventional. After Robin Williams' suicide in 2014, the hashtag \"#ocaptainmycaptain\" began trending on Twitter and fans paid tribute to Williams by recreating the \"O Captain! My Captain!\" scene. Luke Buckmaster, a film critic, wrote in The Guardian that \"some people, maybe even most people, now associate Whitman's verse first and foremost with a movie rather than a poem\"."

In the story, a Wall Street lawyer hires a new clerk who, after an initial bout of hard work, refuses to make copies or do any other task required of him, refusing with the words \"I would prefer not to.\"\nNumerous critical essays have been published about the story, which scholar Robert Milder describes as \"unquestionably the masterpiece of the short fiction\" in the Melville canon."

He already employs two scriveners, Turkey and Nippers, to copy documents by hand, but an increase in business leads him to advertise for a third. He hires the forlorn-looking Bartleby in the hope that his calmness will soothe the other two, each of whom displays an irascible temperament during an opposite half of the day. An errand boy nicknamed Ginger Nut completes the staff.\nAt first, Bartleby produces a large volume of high-quality work, but one day, when asked to help proofread a document, Bartleby answers with what soon becomes his perpetual response to every request: \"I would prefer not to.\" To the dismay of the narrator and the irritation of the other employees, Bartleby begins to perform fewer and fewer tasks and eventually none. He instead spends long periods of time staring out one of the office's windows at a brick wall. The narrator makes several attempts to reason with Bartleby or to learn something about him, but never has any success. When the narrator stops by the office one Sunday morning, he discovers that Bartleby is living there. He is saddened by the thought of the life the young man must lead.\nTension builds as business associates wonder why Bartleby is always present in the office, yet does not appear to do any work. Sensing the threat to his reputation, but emotionally unable to evict Bartleby, the narrator moves his business to a different building. The new tenant of his old office comes to ask for help in removing Bartleby, and the narrator tells the man that he is not responsible for his former employee. A week or so after this, several other tenants of the narrator's former office building come to him with their landlord because Bartleby is still making a nuisance of himself; even though he has been put out of the office, he sits on the building stairs all day and sleeps in its doorway at night. The narrator agrees to visit Bartleby and attempts to reason with him. He suggests several jobs that Bartleby might try and even invites Bartleby to live with him until they figure out a better solution. Bartleby replies that he would \"prefer not to make any change\", and declines the offer. The narrator leaves the building and flees the neighborhood for several days, in order not to be bothered by the landlord and tenants.\nWhen the narrator returns to work, he learns that the landlord has called the police. The officers have arrested Bartleby and imprisoned him in the Tombs as a vagrant. He goes to visit Bartleby, who spurns him, and bribes a cook to make sure Bartleby gets enough food. The narrator returns a few days later to check on Bartleby and discovers him dead of starvation, having preferred not to eat.\nMonths later, the narrator hears a rumor that Bartleby had once worked in a dead letter office and reflects on how this might have affected him. The story ends with the narrator saying, \"Ah Bartleby! Ah humanity!\""

        "content": "Melville's major source of inspiration for the story was an advertisement for a new book, The Lawyer's Story, printed in the Tribune and the Times on February 18, 1853. The book, published anonymously later that year, was written by popular novelist James A. Maitland. This advertisement included the complete first chapter, which started: \"In the summer of 1843, having an extraordinary quantity of deeds to copy, I engaged, temporarily, an extra copying clerk, who interested me considerably, in consequence of his modest, quiet, gentlemanly demeanor, and his intense application to his duties.\" Melville biographer Hershel Parker said nothing else in the chapter besides this \"remarkably evocative sentence\" was notable. Critic Andrew Knighton said Melville may have been influenced by an obscure work from 1846, Robert Grant White's Law and Laziness: or, Students at Law of Leisure, which features an idle scrivener, while Christopher Sten suggests that Melville found inspiration in Ralph Waldo Emerson's essays, particularly \"The Transcendentalist\", which shows parallels to \"Bartleby\".Melville may have written the story as an emotional response to the bad reviews garnered by Pierre, his preceding novel. Financial difficulties may also have played a part: Moby-Dick and Pierre sold so poorly that Melville was in debt to his publisher Harper & Brothers."

She finds a fairy-tale she had heard long ago as a child painted across the village. With the help of her friend, she ends up renting a house, filled messily with art and artefacts. She learns that it belongs to an artist named Maara (R. Madhavan) who is responsible for the paintings across the village. Maara is a free spirit and traveller who is often away visiting various places and returning as he pleases. When she starts cleaning up the place, she finds Maara's photo and a sketchbook. The sketches depict the previous New Year's Eve when a small-time thief (Alexander Babu) tried to rob Maara. In a turn-of-events, Maara joins the thief, and they both go on the rooftop of a home with a plan to rob the place. There, they see a woman about to shoot herself. The sketchbook ends there, and the story is left unfinished, which piques Paaru's curiosity about the rest of the story, and Maara as a person.\nIntrigued, Paaru starts finding the people in Maara's sketches. Backtracking his steps, she meets an antique dealer, Usman bhai, a \u201cpirate\u201d, Chokku and learns about Selvi (Abhirami), a physically abused woman that Maara had known. Maara and Chokku had taken Selvi out to sea for her birthday where after having an evening that alleviated her sorrows, Selvi committed suicide. Maara then ensures that her daughter, Rani is enrolled into a school. When Paaru gets news that Rani has gone missing from her school, she traces her back to her father's lodge. Meanwhile, Maara, who has returned to the village, tracks Rani down to the lodge and rescues her from her abuser. Paaru gets a glimpse of Maara but just misses an encounter with him.\nOne day, she meets the thief depicted in the sketches and enquires about that day's events. He informs her that Maara stopped the woman from shooting herself, and followed her when she started to run away from him. They find the house and finally identify the woman as Doctor Kani (Sshivada). Paaru then tracks her to a mountain village and enquires about her story. Kani explains that when she performed her first independent operation as a paediatrician, a surgical error led to the death of a 10-year-old girl. Further slandered by the media, she was desperate and about to commit suicide on New Year's Eve when she was by chance, stopped by Maara. Maara then brings her to his mountain village, maintained by Vellaiya (Moulee), his foster father, and she has since been living there. Vellaiya, a retired postmaster and a hopeless romantic, has been searching for his teenage love Meenakshi for nearly fifty years. Vellaiya constantly tells the story of acting out a play to convey his love to Meenakshi, and eventually losing her when a storm flooded his home village.\nWhen Vellaiya shows Paaru a photo of Meenakshi, she notices that she has on the same pendant of a conch as her aunt, Mary, who is a nurse at a convent. She brings her Aunt Mary to the village on Vellaiya's birthday, realising that the plot of his play is the fairy-tale she had heard as a child from Aunt Mary - a story of an immortal soldier who spends years looking for his beloved mystical fish. An emotional Velliya, who has spent all his adult life travelling from place to place in search of Meenakshi, thanks Paaru for fulfilling Velliya's wish. Paaru, who has chased one story after another in an attempt to find Maara, finally meets him in person. They introduce themselves and hold hands as they watch the sun set."

Suganth, editor-in-chief of The Times of India gave 3 out of 5 stars stating \"The additional focus on this track results in an increased running time, and also takes the spotlight away from the Paru-Maara romance, leading to an ending that doesn\u2019t leave you on a high that the initial moments promised.\" Logesh Balachandran, writing for India Today, gave 3 out of 5 and stated \"Though it's difficult to recreate the magic of the original film Charlie, Dhilip has managed to retain its essence and delivered a film that leaves a lasting impact.\" Film critic Shubham Kulkarni, writing for the website Koimoi, gave 3 out of 5 stating \"Maara is not for the ones who cannot have a bit suspension of disbelief. But if you have an imagination that can travel far, go for it. There are flaws and a lot of them, but there is a lot of hope too, let\u2019s see at the greener side this time.\"S. Srivatsan of The Hindu stated \"From an aesthetic point of view, \u2018Maara\u2019 directed by Dhilip Kumar is beautifully-shot and works somewhat better than the Malayalam film \u2018Charlie\u2019, although its rigidity comes close to spoiling the otherwise pleasant and charming film.\" Behindwoods gave the film a rating of 2.75 out of 5 stating, \"Maara is a feel-good emotional drama that is painted with a beautiful story.\" Film critic Haricharan Pudipeddi, writing for Hindustan Times stated \"Maara isn\u2019t a frame-by-frame copy, but it retains the magic of Charlie.\" Shubhra Gupta, editor-in-chief for The Indian Express, gave 3 out of 5 stating, \"Madhavan is appropriately loose-limbed and dishy as he ambles through the film, spreading grizzled, warm charm.\" Sudhir Srinivasan, gave 3 out of 5 stars for the film, in his review for Cinema Express, stating \"This film that contains within it several smaller stories, like it were a book of fairytales, is an appeal to recognise the magicality of our world and its people.\"Ranjani Krishnakumar, writing for Firstpost, gave 2.5 out of 5 stars stating \"If you aren\u2019t instinctively drawn to the mystical world that Maara and Paru occupy, or even find it desirable, the film is a drag. If you\u2019re a hopeless, dreamy romantic at heart, you might find your longing fulfilled.\" Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion stated \"The beauty of this fable, based on Charlie, is how much of a love story it is, and yet how it\u2019s not really the love story of the \u201chero\u201d and the \u201cheroine\u201d.\" Gautaman Baskaran of News18 gave 3 out of 5 and stated \"A truly charismatic Madhavan and an unforgettable Srinath make Maara a great watch.\" Sowmya Rajendran of The News Minute, gave 3.5 out of 5 stating \"Madhavan as Maara, however, looks jaded, but Shraddha Srinath carries the film through with her charm.\" Indiaglitz gave the film 2.75 out of 5 stating \"A breezy, heartwarming entertainer with good performances.\""

        "content": "Momo Adachi is a former member of the high school swim team. She tans easily and her hair is bleached out; unfortunately, she is stereotyped by her ignorant classmates and is forced to endure rumors about being an \"easy girl\" who has had many sexual relationships. Her only friend is Sae, who is actually responsible for spreading the nasty gossip due to her jealousy of Momo. Momo is in love with Toji, a taciturn baseball player, but the scheming Sae also has her sights set on the boy. Momo's life is further complicated with the introduction of Kairi Okayasu, a wise-cracking playboy who is determined to make her his. He reveals to Momo that she had saved him from drowning the summer before high school started.\nThings become even more complicated when Sae, in an attempt to make Momo miserable, spreads rumors about Momo and Kairi making out. The rumor about the kiss between the two is true, but it was Kairi who initiated it while Momo remained stunned by the interaction. When Toji is hospitalized, Sae convinces Toji to break up with Momo. Thanks to Kairi, he finds out about all the lies and rumors Sae has made up. Toji saves Momo from being bullied (thanks to Sae's lies again) and tells the truth about him and Momo, resulting in the students apologizing to Momo and hating Sae. Toji and Momo get back together, but Sae later tries to complicate their relationship again by threatening to discredit Momo with her newly acquired access to the mass media. Though Toji is initially defiant, he reluctantly breaks up with Momo to protect her. Momo is heartbroken at first, particularly due to not knowing that it is part of Sae's schemes. However, she eventually begins dating Kairi, whom she had previously considered annoying, and soon begins to fall in love with him. When it is revealed to Momo why Toji broke up with her, Momo is left to choose between Toji and Kairi. More problems arise and the love triangle intensifies.\nIn \"Sae's Story\", Sae is left back a year, for she was always skipping classes. She is too stubborn so she goes to Momo's and Kairi's university every day. Toji goes to a good university by himself. Sae then meets one of her childhood sweethearts, Kanji (or Monkey Boy), who left for Malaysia when they were young, and promised to marry Sae when he was back. In love with Sae, Kanji follows her around, trying to win her over. He takes care of Sae's dog, Sora, when her parents would no longer let her keep it. The dog walks with a little limp; one day when Sora tried to follow Sae, she threw a rock at its paw and injured it. Sae starts modeling and pretends she goes to college with Momo, when she is really still in high school. She meets Honda and works for CC as a model. She meets a guy named Takuma, and he later turns her down. Sae meets another guy named Shinji but realizes he never really liked her. All these ups and downs make Sae realize that Momo, Kairi, and Kanji are the only people who care for her."

Her given name means 'peach' in Japanese. She has tanned skin and light hair (derived from her constant swimming in chlorinated pools while on the swim team), mistakenly giving others the impression that she is a \"beach bunny\", lover of the Ganguro style, or sexually promiscuous. On the contrary, Momo is a shy, insecure girl. She has loved Toji for many years, although later on she finds herself falling in love with Kairi. When she found out Toji disliked girls with tan skin, she started to avoid swimming pools and wore a lot of sunblock to get her skin to its original color (presumed to be fair). Later on, Momo finds out that Toji never said he disliked girls with tan skin. Her friend (Ryoko) from junior high had made that up because she had liked him too. She is often confused later on when she likes both Toji and Kairi at the same time, causing several disputes between the two boys.Sae Kashiwagi (\u67cf\u6728 \u3055\u3048, Kashiwagi Sae)\nVoiced by: Megumi Nasu (Japanese); Cherami Leigh (English)\nPlayed by: Mei Nagano (Live Action 2017)\nThe main antagonist who does everything to ruin Momo's life. Sae's fair features such as her pale skin and dark hair serve as a contrast for Momo; her \"innocent\" appearance belies her scheming, mischievous, trouble making nature. She is the one who spreads malicious gossip about Momo; something Momo knows, but has trouble dealing with, as people are more apt to believe in Sae than the 'airheaded ganguro girl' to the point that Toji believed Sae over Momo (who was currently his girlfriend). She often uses the gossip to make people dislike Momo, as a result of her own jealousy and insecurity. She spreads rumors that she is dating Toji, and that Momo is trying to steal him from her when it is actually the other way around. She really is mean and doesn't care for Momo and isn't her \"real\" friend. All she wants is popularity in school, to humiliate Momo, and to get Toji all for herself. She will stop at nothing to complete this task. Later, she dates a male model named Jigoro and in the end exploits him to help break up Toji and Momo, the nastiest scheme she has ever plotted. She begins to repent after she falls in love with Ryo and understands the hurtful feeling that she caused Momo, when Ryo seemingly gets her pregnant (it later turns out to be a medical condition that simulates pregnancy) and subsequently abandons her.Kairi Okayasu (\u5ca1\u5b89 \u6d6c, Okayasu Kairi)\nVoiced by: Kenichi Suzumura (Japanese); Orion Pitts (English)\nPlayed by: Kei Inoo (Live Action 2017)\nA popular and carefree classmate of Momo's. Sae goes after him after Momo lies that she likes him to protect her and Toji's relationship, but he is the only boy to see straight through Sae for what she really is. He has the reputation of being a playboy, something he is not exactly proud of. He thought that Momo was the one who once gave him CPR when he had nearly drowned at the beach when they were younger; only to later find out he had been saved by the local male lifeguard. His interest in her is renewed when Sae spreads rumors about them being a couple; he adds to this by claiming he has kissed Momo. When Momo is upset by his rumor, he tries to make the rumor true by kissing her unexpectedly in the beginning of the series.After the two start dating, his insecurities about relationships are revealed to stem from his unrequited love for Misao, the school nurse and Kairi's former tutor. However, after he confesses and is shot down by her, he actually feels relieved and confident to pursue his relationship with Momo. He begins fighting over her with Toji and in the end they get back together.The English-language manga uses the non standard romanization \"Kiley Okayasu\". Other groups, such as FUNimation, Kodansha Japan, and non-English language publishers, use \"Kairi\". The English version of Peach Girl NEXT uses Kairi.\nKazuya \"Toji\" Tojigamori (\u6771\u5bfa\u30f6\u68ee \u4e00\u77e2, T\u014djigamori Kazuya, \u3068\u30fc\u3058 T\u014dji)\nVoiced by: Hidenobu Kiuchi (Japanese); Robert McCollum (English)\nPlayed by: Mackenyu (Live Action 2017)A boy who has been Momo's crush since junior high school although she never then confessed to him due to a friend saying he \"doesn't like girls with tan skin\". He overhears Momo confess her love for him to Kairi and then eventually dates Momo but Sae wants him for herself. He has a good heart, but tends to be hard headed and oblivious to what is in front of him, believing what Sae says over what Momo says, much to the frustration of Momo. Sae later blackmails Toji into dating her using pictures of Momo and Jigoro in a hotel bed together. He then breaks up with Momo. After this Momo starts dating Kairi.\nThe Tokyopop manga renders his family name as \"Toujikamori\".\n\nMisao Aki (\u5b89\u82b8 \u64cd, Aki Misao)\nVoiced by: Mami Kingetsu (Japanese); Colleen Clinkenbeard (English)\nPlayed by: Yuika Motokariya (Live Action 2017)The school nurse and a big sister figure for Momo. Misao was once Kairi's tutor and crush, and an old flame of Ryo's.

He serves as a male counterpart to Sae, only he is significantly more dangerous. Ryo is in love with Misao, and dated her briefly, but Misao broke up with him because of his cold and manipulating attitude which is revealed when he smacks Sae after hurting Misao.Sae meets him and quickly falls for him because of their obvious similarities, though Ryo barely takes the relationship seriously and treats Sae poorly. When Sae tells him she is pregnant with his child he gives her money. Ryo is quite touched by Sae when she tells him she wants to make a family with him that will love him. After they find out Sae had a false pregnancy, the two split. However, Ryo stills feels happy about what Sae told him, and seems to be interested in having kids.Goro Ooji (\u5927\u8def \u543e\u90ce, \u014cji Gor\u014d)\nVoiced by: Junichi Suwabe (Japanese); Viktor Walker (English)\nPlayed by: Daisuke Kikuta (Live Action 2017)\nHe is called Jigoro (\u30b8\u30b4\u30ed\u30fc, Jigor\u014d) and is a male model who is smitten with Sae and unaware of her true personality.

One day and without warning, he finds himself summoned to the mysterious world of M\u00c4R Heaven, which he has only seen before in his dreams and in his mother's books. In this fairy tale world, Ginta's physical weakness is replaced with superior physical strength, incredible stamina and endurance, being able to see without his glasses.\nUpon meeting a mysterious 16-year-old witch named Dorothy, Ginta is introduced to the powerful magical accessories and weapons called \"\u00c4RMs\". Dorothy plans to steal the mysterious \u00c4RM Babbo, from a trap-guarded cave, and brings Ginta along to assist her, intrigued by his unusual strength and abilities. Babbo is revealed to be an extremely special and unique \u00c4RM, as he possesses a will of his own and the ability to speak. Displeased with the fact that Babbo is so cumbersome, Dorothy gives Babbo to Ginta instead, departing with a warning that others will try to steal Babbo from him.\nGinta continues on a journey of discovery, reveling in this new world. When Ginta encounters the farmer Jack and his mother, who are troubled by two werewolf brothers, he finds that he misses the real world. Ginta resolves to find a way to reach home while enjoying as much of M\u00c4R as he can along the way, with Jack journeying with him. However, it is not long before Ginta learns that the world of M\u00c4R Heaven is not as peaceful as it seems when he is attacked by thieves wishing to steal Babbo.\nUpon meeting a boy named Alviss, who summoned him to M\u00c4R Heaven using an \u00c4RM known as the Gate Keeper Clown, Ginta learns of the sinister Chess Pieces, an organization who tried to take over M\u00c4R Heaven six years earlier. Alviss reveals that he summoned Ginta in order to gain assistance from an \"other-worlder\" in the upcoming war, as was done previously, and that Babbo originally belonged to one of the knights of the Chess Pieces. Gaining both allies and enemies, the series follows Ginta as he opposes the Chess Pieces, led by King Orb, Queen Diana and her servant Phantom.\n\nM\u00c4R OmegaSet six years after the events of M\u00c4R, the story follows Kai, the adoptive son of an \u00c4RM smith. Kai idolizes Ginta and dreams of having an \u00c4RM for himself, despite not having magic power. Kai, however, inherited a magic stone from his dead parents; a memento that suggests his family's relation to the sorcerer kingdom of Caldia, birthplace of all \u00c4RMs and magic users. At the time throughout M\u00c4R-Heaven, a new type of \u00c4RM, known as \"Fake \u00c4RM\", which is activated without magic power, became highly used.\nOn an errand, Kai is suddenly attacked by a remnant of the Chess Pieces. Kai jumps into a pond, where he meets Babbo. Using the \u00c4RM, Kai defeats the Chess Piece. Babbo wonders how Kai was able to use him, being a normal boy with no powers. Kai returns to his home alongside Babbo. Upon returning, Kai discovers that the Fake \u00c4RM users are possessed and want to take Babbo to bring him to a sinister mysterious figure who was watching them the whole time. Alviss comes to help and reveals that the Fake \u00c4RMs absorb the life energy from their users, allowing to control their minds in the process.\nKai, alongside Babbo, Alviss and his friend Elise, go to Caldia to seek help. They are welcomed into the Grand Elder's palace by Dorothy and a young wizard, Inga. The Grand Elder tells them that over 300 years ago the Fake \u00c4RMs were created by a dark magician, Unwetter, who experimented with the human mind manipulation. Babbo, the Elder of Caldia at the time, defeated him, consigning him and his malicious creations into oblivion, just before dying, transferring his soul into the \u00c4RM and erasing every memory related to the incident.\nThe Grand Elder does not know, however, why the supposedly sealed Fake \u00c4RMs were once again spread throughout M\u00c4R Heaven, how the supposedly dead Unwetter could have been revived or what his goals are. The Grand Elder decides to seal Babbo to avoid more trouble, to which Kai disagrees. The Grand Elder orders Kai to prove himself worthy of wielding Babbo. Kai eventually unleashes all his dormant magic power, which is so powerful that confirms his relation to the magic kingdom and a direct blood connection to Babbo, finding out that he is one of his descendants.\nA group of Fake \u00c4RM users present themselves before Caldia to take Babbo back to Unwetter. Kai and crew are able to fight them back with the assistance of Inga, who is revealed to be a descendant of Unwetter. Following Caldia's law, they must seek Unwetter out and kill him. Kai, alongside Inga and Elise go on a journey to find Babbo's magic stones, which would restore his memories of the Grand Elder who fought the Fake \u00c4RMs and Unwetter 300 years ago, and save M\u00c4R Heaven."

The most unlikely events have become the most likely, from highly improbable dice throws to serious infrastructure failure.

Multiracial Adele uses prayers for a Christian god as well as African orishas, a selection of herbs, a Saint Christopher medal, and a collection of lucky objects as part of her daily ritual. As she walks to work, she encounters a shuttle train that has jumped the tracks because of a wrench left there (an event with a million to one odds), causing horrible carnage, and stops to help.The news claims New York is a den of iniquity, causing this semi-apocalypse, but Adele is skeptical. Large quantities of missionaries have swarmed the city, and one corners Adele to give her a flyer for a mass prayer throughout the city on August 8 - a lucky day for the Chinese. Princeton has proved that the power of positive thought now has real effect over reality. In a chain of unlikely events, Adele is almost pushed into oncoming traffic on her walk home, but is saved by finding a four-leaf clover, which she plants in her fire escape garden.On her way to the famers' market to barter her vegetables for fruit and news about the mass prayer, Adele gives her neighbor an eggplant. She teaches him how to cook it, and they discuss the prayer event. He is uninterested in prayer, and more noncommittal about the changed state of things. They have sex with protection - crossing fingers while putting the condom on and touching a rabbit's foot.As the multi-denominational prayer event approaches, Adele debates going and considers the significance of belief and accepting change.

        "content": "The poem has ten stanzas, each with three lines of eleven syllables and final line of five syllables, always the same picking up the first call, \"Lobet den Herren\". This Strophe format was often used in poetry of German  Humanism and Baroque, and was called Sapphic stanza. It is also used in hymns such as \"Herzliebster Jesu\" by Johann Heermann. The rhyming is unconventional, rhyming within the two halves of the first line, but leaving the final line without rhyme. All new hymnals change in the first line \"f\u00fcrchten\" to \"ehren\" to comply with the scheme.The repeated line \"Lobet den Herren\" has the same function as the biblical Hallelujah: both a call to praise, and the praise. Gerhardt uses it for a morning prayer, beginning the day with praise, motivated in stanzas 2 to 5 by thanks for protection from dangers of the night. They may have been inspired by dangers experienced in the Thirty Years' War. Stanzas 6 to 9 are a prayer for further for guidance on a way following divine sommandments, expecting the second coming of Christ (\"deiner Zukunft\"). The last stanza envisions, in an eschatological outlook, the ultimate praise in community with the angels."

Hibari-kun!) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hisashi Eguchi. It was serialized in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump from October 1981 to November 1983, and the chapters were published in four tank\u014dbon volumes by Shueisha from November 1982 to January 1984. The series was adapted into a 35-episode anime television series by Toei Animation that aired on Fuji Television from May 1983 to January 1984. The story focuses on K\u014dsaku Sakamoto, a high school student who goes to live with yakuza boss Ibari \u014czora and his four children\u2014Tsugumi, Tsubame, Hibari and Suzume\u2014after the death of his mother. K\u014dsaku is shocked to learn that Hibari, who looks and behaves as a girl, was assigned male at birth.\nEguchi wanted to create a romantic comedy manga where the main female character is a cross-dressing boy so as to poke fun at the genre. He took more time to draw the chapters compared to his earlier manga, and as the serialization continued, he found it increasingly difficult to keep up a weekly pace for the chapters. He eventually abandoned the series after the editor-in-chief of Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump refused his request to release the chapters every other week. From July 2009 to February 2010, Shogakukan published a three-volume Stop!! Hibari-kun! Complete Edition omnibus collection, which features various revisions to the originally published chapters in addition to newly drawn cover art.\nStop!! Hibari-kun! has been described as achieving a dizzying reality with Hibari by contrasting a girlish exterior with a male interior. The series has been praised for its overall light and pop literary style, and the delicate touch in how Hibari is drawn has been described as so attractive that it makes the reader forget that it is a gag manga. However, the jokes surrounding the yakuza characters have been criticized as extreme and no longer humorous in modern times. The series has also been described as having had a hand in paving the way for the J-pop phenomenon."

Although K\u014dsaku is initially unsure about his situation, he is relieved when he meets Ibari's four children: Tsugumi, Tsubame, Hibari and Suzume. K\u014dsaku is attracted to Hibari from the start, but he is shocked to learn that Hibari, who looks and behaves as a girl, was assigned male at birth\u2014something only known within the \u014czora Group and Hibari's family. A group of four girls led by Kaori Hanazono begin to suspect that Hibari may be transgender, but Tsubame takes Hibari's place during a health checkup, effectively quelling any suspicions. Hibari begins to show an immediate interest in K\u014dsaku, so in an effort to distance himself from Hibari, K\u014dsaku joins the Wakaba Academy boxing club. Also in the club is Makoto Shiina, who is attracted to Hibari, and Rie Kawai, the club manager who K\u014dsaku likes. Hibari soon joins the club as its second manager shortly before they go on a training camp in Kuj\u016bkuri at the end of the year.\nAt the start of the new school year, Hibari is scouted to join the girls' volleyball team after the captain, Jun \u014ctori, witnesses Hibari's athletic prowess. Although Hibari refuses, Jun continues to pursue Hibari until Jun is overwhelmed by Hibari's superhuman ability to spike the ball. After Kaori and her friends try to embarrass Hibari during swim class, they once again suspect that Hibari may be a guy, but Hibari prevents them from getting any proof during the school sponsored summer camp. After Hibari refuses several advances from a popular guy at school named Takuto Honda, Hibari starts openly flirting with K\u014dsaku at school. Shiina becomes enraged at K\u014dsaku for earning Hibari's affection, but Shiina and K\u014dsaku grow closer as friends after they fight it out and K\u014dsaku reassures him that there is nothing going on between him and Hibari.\nWhen K\u014dsaku is out jogging one day, he helps out a girl named Sayuri K\u014denji who was being harassed by three guys from the Kokury\u016b High School boxing club, although Hibari deals with them before K\u014dsaku can do anything. Despite this, Sayuri is instantly enamored by K\u014dsaku and hires a detective to find out more about him, leading her to discover Hibari's secret. Hibari has another run-in with the Kokury\u016b boxing club members after they harass Tsubame at a festival. The Kokury\u016b boxing club challenges the Wakaba boxing club to some inter-school matches, but this turns out to be a ruse to get a chance to gang up on Hibari. However, the \u014czora Group intercedes, allowing Hibari to knock out the Kokury\u016b boxing club's leader. Sayuri transfers into K\u014dsaku's class, and she blackmails him into going on a date with her in exchange for not revealing Hibari's secret. During the school festival, K\u014dsaku's class acts out a Sleeping Beauty play with K\u014dsaku as the prince and Hibari as the princess, culminating in Hibari giving K\u014dsaku a French kiss on stage. Ibari agrees to look after Gekijir\u014d Taiga, the son of one of his close friends, who K\u014dsaku is surprised to learn is a trans man."

Hibari-kun! as achieving a \"dizzying reality\" with Hibari \"by contrasting a girlish exterior with a male interior\", and went on to say that the series could be seen as a \"continuation of the sartorial perversion lineage\" of cross-dressing characters. Manga critic Haruyuki Nakano has called Stop!! Hibari-kun! a unique and outstanding gag manga for its juxtaposition of Hibari being a boy and the heir to a yakuza organization. Nakano largely attributes this successful combination to Eguchi's ability to draw girls that are not only cute, but also have good taste and sex appeal. The delicate touch in how Hibari is drawn has been described as so attractive that it makes the reader forget that it is a gag manga.\n\nIn writing for the magazine Cyzo, manga critic Jyamao wrote that because of its overall light and pop literary style, none of the indecency or immorality cross-dressing may engender comes through, which he surmises is why the anime was able to air during prime time. Jyamao notes the more extreme nature of the jokes surrounding the yakuza characters in comparison to the jokes involving cross-dressing, and that some jokes such as those involving drugs would not be humorous today. Manga commentator Nobunaga Minami lauded Eguchi for being a pioneer in drawing characters with a high fashion sense in Stop!! Hibari-kun!, which he says effectively changed fashion in sh\u014dnen manga from being seen as a \"symbol\" to now being treated as an \"accessory\". Eguchi's attention to detail is also praised, such as drawing K\u014dsaku wearing Chuck Taylor All-Stars in one chapter.The series has been described as \"effervescent,\" and as helping pave the way for the J-pop phenomenon. When Tegami Bachi author Hiroyuki Asada read Stop!! Hibari-kun! in junior high school, he admired its novel sensibility, and Eguchi's art also influenced him. According to Eguchi, some people who read Stop!! Hibari-kun! were influenced to start cross-dressing."

To all charitable Souls for the Satisfaction and Increase of their holy Love / to the Praise and Honour of God presented.\nScheffler's poem is in eight stanzas of six lines each, with rhyme scheme ABABCC. The shorter final line accents its content. It is part of a 1657 collection of pastoral religious poetry, Heilige Seelen-Lust Oder geistliche Hirten-Lieder Der in ihren JESUM verliebten Psyche (Holy bliss of the soul, or: spiritual shepherd songs of Psyche who is in love with her Jesus), in which the first person (ich) is the shepherdess and Jesus the shepherd. The original header confirm this: \"Sie verspricht sich jhn bi\u00df in Tod zu lieben\" (She promises herself to love him until her death). The poetry is in the tradition to interpret the Song of Songs as referring to Jesus.The first two stanzas are a confession of love, with seven of its twelve lines beginning \"Ich will dich lieben\". The religious dimension is revealed at the end of the second stanza, referring to \"Gottes Lamm\" (Lamb of God). The first line relates already to Psalm 18:2. The third and fourth stanza refer to the themes of searching for the missed loved one from the Song of Songs. Love is described as \"sp\u00e4t\" (late), following Augustine's Confessiones 10, 27 and 34. It may relate to Scheffler's \"late\" (1653) conversion to the Catholic Church. The fifth to seventh stanzas express thanks for \"Himmelswonne\" (Heavenly bliss), including erotic imagery in the seventh stanza, which is therefore sometimes omitted in hymnals. The final stanza repeats the promise of the first, adding the motif of love for love's sake, without reward."

The poem is in bar form, but the melody does not repeat the beginning lines. It hides the shorter final line by an expressive melisma.\nThe text was also sung with other melodies, such as  published in the hymnal Harmonischer Liederschatz (Harmonic treasure of songs) in 1738 by Johann Balthasar K\u00f6nig, a melody that was preferred in Protestant hymnals."

The hymnal Kirchenlied, published in 1938, which had again Joseph's melody, brought its breakthrough. It was included in the 1975 Gotteslob and in the 2013 Gotteslob as GL 358.Peter Cornelius composed a six-part motet on three stanzas, his Op. 18/2."

McCartney began writing the song in Rishikesh, India, where the Beatles were studying Transcendental Meditation in the early months of 1968. John Lennon and Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan, who joined the Beatles on their retreat, also made contributions to the song.

        "content": "The song, a country style ballad, is titled from the character's name, which was originally \"Rocky Sassoon\", but McCartney changed it to \"Rocky Raccoon\" because he thought \"it sounded more like a cowboy\". Former 13th Floor Elevators drummer Danny Thomas claims the name \"Rocky\" was inspired by Roky Erickson, the American rock band's then-vocalist and -guitarist. According to Beatles historian Kenneth Womack, McCartney drew his inspiration for the song from Robert Service's poem \"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\". Canadian photographer and filmmaker Paul Saltzman, author of The Beatles in Rishikesh and The Beatles in India, has expressed the belief that Paul McCartney based the lyrics for \u2018Rocky Raccoon\u2019 on Saltzman\u2019s description to him in Rishikesh of his girlfriend having recently left him for another man. The Old West-style honky-tonk piano was played by producer George Martin. \"Rocky Raccoon\" is also the last Beatles song to feature John Lennon's harmonica playing.\nThe lyrics describe a conflict over a love triangle, in which Rocky's girlfriend McGill (known to the public as Nancy) leaves him for a man named Dan, who punches Rocky in the eye. Rocky vows revenge and takes a room at the local saloon.  He bursts into the room, armed with a gun, but Dan outdraws and shoots him. A drunken doctor attends to Rocky, who insists that the wound is only a minor one. Stumbling back to his room, Rocky finds a Gideon Bible."

The song was originally attempted in March 1968 as a potential track for Nilsson's Aerial Ballet (1968) or Harry (1969). This earlier version of the song is cheerier and more uptempo than the recording that was released on Nilsson Schmilsson. The remake takes on a more serious tone and features an aleatoric glissando at the end. Producer Richard Perry said that the addition was inspired by the number of takes devoted to the song: \"We had to do so many takes that we got cabin fever and started messing around, and Harry decided to incorporate the craziness in the song.\"Nilsson biographer Alyn Shipton suggests that portions of the song are based on Nilsson's former dayjob as a computer programmer at a bank, while other portions are written from the point of view of his parents. Part of the lyrics mention a woman who knew a military sailor that \"would pound her for a couple of days, and then he'd sail across the bubbly waves, and those were happier days.\" According to Pitchfork writer Mike Powell, the lyric demonstrate Nilsson's \"intelligence as a writer ... The Nilsson-ness is in the phrase pound her \u2013 a contrast between sweet nostalgia and unsentimental truth.\"AllMusic reviewer Matthew Greenwalk said that the lyrics illustrate a \"dread of aging and facing responsibility\" as Nilsson describes waking up after a wild party and \"having to get on with reality \u2013 grudgingly.\" Aisha Harris of The New York Times wrote that the song's \"bright, infectious instrumentation belies melancholy, wistful lyrics about growing older.\""

        "content": "\"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" is a song written by composer Matthew Wilder and lyricist David Zippel for Walt Disney Pictures' animated film Mulan (1998). Appearing on the film's soundtrack Mulan: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack, \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" is performed by American singer Donny Osmond as the singing voice of Captain Li Shang in lieu of American actor BD Wong, who provides the character's speaking voice. The song also features contributions from Lea Salonga as the singing voice of Mulan, Eddie Murphy as Mushu, and Harvey Fierstein, Jerry Tondo and Wilder himself as Yao, Chien-Po and Ling, respectively. In addition, Mushu has a speaking line unlike the other characters in the song.\n\"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" was written to replace the song \"We'll Make a Man of You\" after the film's original songwriter Stephen Schwartz departed from the project in favor of working on DreamWorks' The Prince of Egypt (1998). Wilder and Zippel were inspired to complete the song after conceiving its ironic title, and the initial draft of the track was immediately approved by Disney. Prior to Mulan, Osmond had auditioned for the role of Hercules in Disney's Hercules (1997), a role for which he was ultimately turned down by the directors because they felt that he sounded too old. Disney eventually cast Osmond as the singing voice of Shang because his singing voice is similar to Wong's speaking voice. An up-tempo military-style song that incorporates both Eastern and Western musical styles, \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" is performed by Shang during a rigorous training montage in which his young, inexperienced soldiers attempt to justify their worth. The song's title is considered ironic because Mulan, who relies on intelligence, ultimately proves more competent than her male comrades, including Captain Li Shang, who takes a liking to her, while its lyrics explore hyper-masculinity contradicted with Mulan's gender.\n\"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" has received mostly positive reviews from film and music critics, some of whom dubbed it the film's best song, while praising Osmond's performance. Critics have also drawn comparisons between the song and Disney's Hercules, while likening Mulan's role and transformation to actress Demi Moore's performance as Lieutenant Jordan O'Neil in the film G. I. Jane (1997). The song has since appeared on several \"best of\" Disney songs lists, including those of Total Film and the New York Post. Discussed by film critics, film historians, academic journalists and feminists, the song has gone on to be recorded and covered in several different languages\u2014namely Mandarin, Cantonese and Spanish\u2014by entertainers Jackie Chan and Cristian Castro, respectively."

        "content": "\"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" was written by composer Matthew Wilder and lyricist David Zippel, who were hired to write Mulan's songs because Disney was interested in recruiting songwriters \"that ... would give kind of a different sound to each of the songs.\" While Zippel, a Broadway lyricist, was recruited because the directors were impressed with his work on Disney's Hercules (1997), at the time Wilder, a pop singer, had been best known for his song \"Break My Stride\". Bancroft believes that, although the songwriters \"had two different sensibilities ... the blend [of their styles] worked well together, especially on ['I'll Make a Man Out of You']\".Songwriter Stephen Schwartz was originally slated to write lyrics for Mulan until he was replaced by Zippel \"at the last moment.\" Schwartz had written a song called \"We'll Make a Man of You\" for the scene in which Mulan is training to be a soldier. The song was ultimately replaced with Wilder and Zippel's \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" when Schwartz was forced to resign from Mulan by Disney executives Peter Schneider and Michael Eisner because the songwriter had also agreed to score rival studio DreamWorks' animated film The Prince of Egypt (1998). Wilder and Zippel first conceived the song's title, which then inspired them to write its lyrics and music. Zippel identified determining the song's ironic title as the moment \"he knew he'd hit on something great\" by \"contrasting Mulan's gender with the concept of what it means to be a man.\" The songwriters were hoping to create an original version of a training montage that was funny without being obvious, while remaining in character at all times. In an unlikely situation, the filmmakers universally enjoyed the song from its very first draft.Wilder described himself as using \"an everything-and-the-kitchen-sink approach\" to composing its music, explaining, \"I knew I wanted it to sound large and I knew what the tempo and the cadence of the piece was.\" Combining Eastern and Western styles, Wilder borrowed \"drum cadences from traditional Chinese drums and then marrying that with military snares\", upon which he continued building until \"it became this cacophonous effect of a Chinese marching American band\". Wilder and Zippel decided to incorporate drums into the track to demonstrate a sense of masculinity and musculature, identifying the song as very odd in structure but appropriate for its lyrics. Zippel's incorporation of \"naturalistic descriptions of masculinity\" into the song's lyrics \u2013 raging fire, coursing river, great typhoon \u2013 was used in an attempt to \"get inside Shang's head space\", elaborating, \"I was just trying to be in character for the captain and how an Asian captain would lead his group differently than how a Western captain would call his troops,\" identifying as an opportunity \"to put some specificity into it.\" Wilder recorded the song's demo himself, which was arranged into a composition featuring a 100-piece orchestra and male choir conducted by musician Paul Buckmaster.Before Mulan, American singer Donny Osmond had auditioned for the lead role in Hercules, a role for which he was ultimately not cast because the directors felt that his voice sounded \"too old\" and \"too deep\" for the character. Osmond later revealed in an interview with People that he was so embarrassed by his Hercules audition that he had nearly considered ending his singing career prematurely. A few months later, Disney contacted Osmond with interest in casting him as the singing voice of Shang after comparing his audition tapes to BD Wong and determining that both actors have \"very similar voices.\" In one scene, Osmond's character, Shang, is hit in the stomach while singing \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\". In order to sound as realistic as possible, Osmond punched himself in the stomach several times while recording the song."

        "content": "\"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" is performed by Captain Li Shang during Mulan's training montage, which has also been identified as the film's \"boot camp sequence.\" The scene explores Shang's attempt to train his newly recruited squadron of incompetent soldiers in the hopes of ultimately transforming them into a skilled army. Occupying a significant portion of the film's plot, Shang promises to turn his team of \"rag-tag recruits\" into men, implying that they are merely boys unless they learn to fight while entirely unaware that Mulan is a woman. The musical number is used to \"compress dramatic time or narrate\" in a more compelling way than had solely dialogue been used. The scene begins with Shang shooting an arrow into the top of a tall pole and challenging all of his soldiers to retrieve it, each of whom fail until Mulan eventually succeeds. According to the book Into the Closet: Cross-Dressing and the Gendered Body in Children's Literature and Film by Victoria Flanagan, Mulan is successful in retrieving the arrow because she uses \"an ingenuity that is based upon her ability to incorporate aspects of femininity into her masculine performance.\" By the end of the scene, all of the soldiers have improved dramatically and the results of their practice and training are finally revealed. In what Joshua and Judges author Athalya Brenner called \"a humorous reversal toward the end of the movie,\" Mulan and her male comrades disguise themselves as concubines in order to infiltrate the palace and rescue the emperor while \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" reprises in the background.Critics have observed ways in which the scene explores Mulan's growth and transformation as the character evolves from a clumsy, inexperienced recruit into one of the army's most skilled soldiers, in spite of her gender. According to the book Literacy, Play and Globalization: Converging Imaginaries in Children's Critical and Cultural Performances, the montage depicts Mulan's gender as \"an obstacle to overcome.\" Author Phyllis Frus wrote in her book Beyond Adaptation: Essays on Radical Transformations of Original Works, \"The need for inexperienced young men to go through a rigorous training results in a sequence common to many films,\" and that the scene \"shows the challenges Ping/Mulan faces due to her\" inexperience. As observed by Juanita Kwok in the book Film Asia: New Perspectives on Film for English, the irony of the scene lies within the fact that \"Mulan proves herself more competent than any of the men.\" The author also observed that the scene's first refrain accompanies shots of Shang, while its second \"coincides with Mulan climbing to the top of the pole.\" Additionally, while the earlier, all-female musical number \"Honor to Us All\" \"functions as an account of the constructedness of female gender,\" \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" \"juxtaposes and makes explicit the contention that gender is a cultural product,\" according to Johnson Cheu, author of Diversity in Disney Films: Critical Essays on Race, Ethnicity, Gender, Sexuality and Disability. The Representation of Gender in Walt Disney's \"Mulan\" believes that the song emphasizes desirable masculine traits, namely \"discipline ... tranquility, celerity, strength and fearlessness,\" while Shang, according to Putting the Grail Back into Girl Power: How a Girl Saved Camelot, and why it Matters, \"views [femininity] as comparable to weakness.\" In her article Disney's \"Mulan\"\u2014the \"True\" Deconstructed Heroine?, Lisa Brocklebank argued the song explores themes such as othering, ostracism and abjection. Hannah Yasharoff, writing for USA Today, believes Mulan is used to counter the idea that masculinity is \"the only way to become strong enough to win the war\".Comparing the song to other training sequences such as Private Benjamin (1980), Wilder explained that the filmmakers \"were trying to marry the idea of that hyper-masculinity as if it were a Marine moment, but instead of it being Marines, it was the Chinese army.\" Critics have drawn similarities between the \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" sequence and Hercules' training montage in Disney's Hercules (1997), as well as actress Demi Moore's role as Lieutenant Jordan O'Neil in the film G. I. Jane (1997). In the book Ways of Being Male: Representing Masculinities in Children's Literature, author John Stephens wrote that although both Mulan and Hercules depict \"the active male body as spectacle,\" Mulan's is less \"straight-forward\" due to the character's gender. Michael Dequina of The Movie Report observed that \"Mulan's transformation is highly reminiscent of Demi Moore's in last year's Disney drama G.I. Jane, but Mulan oneups that film's hour-long toughening process by efficiently covering the same ground during a single, rousing musical number.\""

        "content": "Written in common time at a tempo of 114 beats per minute and starting out in the key of G major, \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" has been identified as a \"heroic power ballad\" and anthem that features an upbeat, \"thumping\" rhythm. Wilder himself has identified \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" as \"a very odd pop song\". The Disney Song Encyclopedia described the song as a \"rhythmic military song.\" Beginning with \"a military-style drum\" introduction, \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\", which is immediately preceded by the emotional ballad \"Reflection\" on the film's soundtrack album, \"breaks up the slower pace of the songs,\" according to Filmtracks.com. Similar to the song \"A Girl Worth Fighting For\", the \"ironically titled\" \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" \"play[s] off Mulan's secret\" because Shang is unaware that she is actually a girl, as observed by Jeffrey Gantz of The Phoenix. Johnson Cheu, author of Diversity in Disney Films: Critical Essays on Race, Ethnicity, Gender, Sexuality and Disability, received the song as a counterpart to the all-female musical number \"Honor to Us All\". Going into the last verse, the song's key shifts up to F minor and later towards the end, \"the backing track falls into silence and [Osmond's] vocals come to the fore.\" Osmond's vocal range spans one octave, from D3 To G#4 Beginning with two verses, followed by a bridge, a refrain, a final verse and repeated choruses, the song is a total of three minutes and twenty-one seconds in length.Entertainment Weekly identified the number as the film's \"rambunctious peak.\" According to Victoria Flanagan, author of Into the Closet: Gender and Cross-dressing in Children's Fiction: Cross-Dressing and the Gendered Body in Children's Literature and Film, \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" is \"a playful parody of conventional masculinity.\" USA Today's Hannah Yasharoff described the song as \"a tongue-in-cheek comment on sexism\". Lyrically, Zippel described the track as a song about \"hyper-masculinity\" that is disturbed by \"the whole idea of Mulan\", identifying the song as an opportunity \"to have those two issues head-to-head.\" The lyric \"I'll make a man out of you\" is constantly repeated and reinforced by Shang. According to author John Stephens of Ways of Being Male: Representing Masculinities in Children's Literature, the song's lyrics \"initially define masculinity in opposition to femininity,\" with its first verse beginning, Let's get down to business \nTo defeat the Huns / Did they send me daughters / When l asked for sons ?\" Its chorus reads, Be a man We must be swift as the coursing  river / Be a man With all the force  of a great typhoon / Be a man With all the strength of a raging fire / Mysterious as the dark side of the moon \" which, according to Ways of Being Male: Representing Masculinities in Children's Literature, \"essentializes masculinity by asserting that it embodies the speed, strength and power of the natural world, and yet contains this within an aura of tranquility and mystery.\" According to Beyond Adaptation: Essays on Radical Transformations of Original Works, these lyrics \"add a hint of darkness as they celebrate male prowess\" by suggesting that one who has \"acquired fiery strength\" is also \"untamed as the moon's dark side.\" According to The Phoenix, Osmond performs the song's lyrics with \"grit.\" Meanwhile, the singer is backed up by a macho-sounding choir repeatedly chanting \"Be a man!\", a call and response preceded by three chords intertwined with lyrics such as \"you must be swift as the coursing river\" and \"with all the force of a great typhoon.\" Entertainment Weekly's Maureen Lee Lenker identified the \"Be a man\" chorus as the song's most iconic moment."

While living in the city, she began meeting artists, painters and musicians, who would invite her to \"living room sessions\". In these sessions,  they would bring food, sit around the table and musicians would start playing instruments, singing fado and samba music. Finding herself \"connected through music\", the singer decided to create an album; \"I found my tribe [in Lisbon] and a magical world of incredible musicians that reinforced my belief that music across the world is truly all connected and is the soul of the universe\". On April 15, 2019, Madonna revealed Madame X as the album's title. For the album, she worked with longtime collaborator Mirwais, who had previously worked on her albums Music (2000), American Life (2003) and Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), as well as Mike Dean, who was a producer on Rebel Heart (2015), and Diplo.\"Dark Ballet\" was written and produced by Madonna and Mirwais, and samples Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker (1892). It has been described as an experimental pop and electro-gospel piano ballad, with the vocals making use of a vocoder, and lyrics that address the singer's faith and \"lifelong crusade against the patriarchal forces of religion, gender, and celebrity\". In the opening verse, Madonna sings with \"forceful confidence\" the phrase \"I can dress like a boy/I can dress like a girl\" and, in an ironic tone, how \"our world is obsessed with fame\". Following a piano interlude, it morphs into a \"sinister\" and \"mangled, glitching\" fragment from The Nutcracker's Dance of the Reed Pipes, in which Madonna sings in a heavily edited robotic voice \"I will not denounce the things that I have said/I will not renounce my faith in my sweet Lord\". This last part, according to AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, evokes Stanley Kubrick's 1971 film A Clockwork Orange. Madonna then utters the phrase \"The storm isn't in the air/it's inside of us\". The song ends with Madonna's daughters Stella and Estere blowing air through their lips, simulating wind. Madonna said the main inspiration of the song was Joan of Arc. During an interview with Rolling Stone, she explained that even after Joan of Arc won the fight against the English, the French were not pleased and \"judged her\". They affirmed she was a man, a lesbian, a witch, and \"burned her at the stake\", despite her being fearless. Madonna concluded, \"I admire that\". \"Dark Ballet\" was released the final promotional single from Madame X on June 7, 2019."

It starred American rapper Mykki Blanco playing the role of a transgender Joan of Arc who gets burned at the stake. Madonna met Blanco through producer Mike Dean and became interested in working with her. After contacting her, Blanco flew to London and met her at her home. She had her listen to a finished version of the album and asked her to portray Joan of Arc in the video. Blanco is openly gay and HIV-positive, and Madonna felt she could relate to Joan's struggles; \"if you had existed as you in her time \u2014 you would have been burned at the stake as well\", she told her. According to Blanco, Madonna served as co-director and even worked on choreography, cinematography and costume design, but remained uncredited. On June 5, she shared two previews of the video on her Instagram account: one showed her wearing a veil, intercut with religious iconography, while the other depicted Blanco being burned.The video opens with a quote by Joan of Arc: \"One life is all we have and we live it as we believe in living it. But to sacrifice what you are and to live without belief, that is a fate more terrible than dying\". Told in a nonlinear narrative, it begins with Blanco held captive in a stone cell, she's wearing a dirty white robe with her wrists bound. She's then led by \"stone faced\" clergymen to her execution as she sings along to the lyrics. Blanco is then seen dancing, first in a cathedral wearing a gold corset, similar to the one Madonna wore on her Blond Ambition World Tour (1990), pleading with the men to spare her, and then at an altar. The final shot is of a naked Blanco, her head shaved off, being burned at the stake while a bunch of veiled nuns, one of them Madonna, look from below. The video ends with an \"inspiring\" quote from Blanco: \"I have walked this earth, Black, Queer and HIV positive, but no transgression against me has been as powerful as the hope I hold within\".It received positive reviews from critics. Althea Legaspi from Rolling Stone, called it \"cinematic\". Alexa Camp noted a \"blink-and-you'll-miss-it\" shot from Carl Theodor Dreyer's 1928 film The Passion of Joan of Arc at the very beginning. She also saw similarities to Madonna's 1989 video for \"Like a Prayer\", specifically in the use of religious imagery and the story revolving around a persecuted black person. Camp concluded that by casting a person of color and not herself as \"the oppressed\", Madonna was highlighting \"the disproportionate impact of the patriarchy on minorities\". For Paper's Justin Moran \"[Mykki Blanco's] take on Joan of Arc mirrors how his own everyday relishes the in-between\", also pointing out the singer's absence in the video. Mike Wass hailed the video as a \"gothic nightmare\" and \"eerie\". According to CNN's Chloe Melas, the video was \"fresh proof that Madonna has never been afraid to push the limits\". In June 2019, it was named by Billboard as one of \"The 20 Best Music Videos of 2019 (So Far)\"."

After singing \"Like a Prayer\" and a cover of Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah\" (1984), she began singing the song wearing a corset and a metallic arm accessory, her hair was braided and parted down the center.\nSeveral dancers, wearing similar costumes, performed a choreography that seemed to control and restrain her movements.

The performance was included on the live album Madame X: Music from the Theater Xperience.\nOn October 9, 2021, following the release of the Madame X concert film, Madonna gave an \"intimate cabaret performance\" in the basement of Marcus Samuelsson's Harlem restaurant Red Rooster, and sang Lounge renditions of \"Dark Ballet\", \"La Isla Bonita\" (1987), Madame X album track \"Crazy\", and Cape Verdean  coladeira song \"Sodade\"; she was dressed in a black cocktail dress with a \"dramatic leg slit\", lace gloves and long blonde wig."

Grant, and included in King's 1985 collection Skeleton Crew. The Robinsonade follows a shipwrecked drug-trafficking surgeon who, left with only a large amount of drugs and no food or resources, resorts to self-cannibalism.\nKing considered the idea that came to him to be too disgusting, saying that \"[it] goes a little bit too far, even for me.\" He consulted with a doctor, discussing how long a person could feed on his own body. Even being a famous writer, the author could not get the story published for a long time. Literary critics emphasized the author\u2019s courage, humor and irony inherent in the work, as well as the realism of the events described, though some assessments of the plot were more restrained. The story has been adapted into short films twice, in 2011 and 2012, and as an episode of the television series Creepshow."

        "content": "The story opens with the following epigraph:\n\n\"Sooner or later the question comes up in every medical student's career. How much shock-trauma can the patient stand? Different instructors answer the question, in different ways, but cut to its base level, the answer is always another question: How badly does the patient want to survive?\"\nSurvivor Type is written as the diary of a disgraced surgeon, Richard Pine n\u00e9 Pinzetti, who, while attempting to smuggle a large amount of heroin aboard a cruise ship, is forced to escape when an explosion causes the ship to sink. He relates growing up poor in an Italian-American neighborhood and playing college football (which he hated) to get into a good college and then went on to medical school and in time a successful practice until his illegal distribution of prescription medicines and blank forms led to the loss of his license. He arranged to smuggle heroin from Vietnam to make a large amount of money, which would then be distributed for bribes that would enable him to return to practicing medicine. While encountering a storm in his empty lifeboat, Pine finds himself marooned on a tiny island in the Pacific Ocean whose exact location is completely unknown to him, with very limited supplies and no food. A self-proclaimed \"survivor\" type, Pine bitterly whiles away the time by using a logbook as his diary, detailing his rise and fall in the medical profession and his determination to survive this ordeal, get even with the people that \"screwed him over,\" and return to prosperity.\nOver time, the diary entries become more and more disjointed and raving, revealing Pine's slow mental decay and eventual insanity caused by starvation, isolation and drug use. Determined to hold out for rescue, he goes to horrifying lengths to survive. He eats insects, kelp and seagulls. After fracturing his ankle while attempting to signal an airplane, he amputates his own foot, then realizes he has to eat it to survive. He continues to amputate his own limbs to use as a food source, ingesting the heroin as a crude anesthetic during these operations. His last few diary entries, barely comprehensible, indicate that Pine has sliced off and eaten both legs, as well as his earlobes, and drools uncontrollably as he ponders which body part to consume next. The diary entries end when he cuts off his left hand to eat it and writes \"lady fingers they taste just like lady fingers.\""

Hesitant to write anything down, King gained the assurance for the story after speaking with his neighbor, Ralph Drews, a retired doctor who confirmed that \"a guy could subsist on himself for quite a while - like everything else which is material, the human body is just stored energy.\" Dr. Drews's further elaborations became the inspiration for the opening epigraph of the story.King wrote \"Survivor Type\" in 1977, but he was unable to sell it for years; he stated that \"not even men's magazines would consider this one\"."

From the opening passages, it could easily unfold as a classic noir tale: A rainy night outside a gambling club, Kaddus and Cruizell confront the reluctant but indebted Wrobik with a dead-end deal.  In a couple of days a starship carrying the planet\u2019s admiral will be returning, and Wrobik is to shoot it down, over the city, using a small pistol which they give him to use.  It is only when the gun is placed in his hands, does it become clear that this is another reality: it \"comes to life,\" lights blinking, small screen flickering.  The pistol will function only for those biologically of the Culture, and is the only weapon able to penetrate the starship\u2019s defenses, making the alien Wrobik the perfect candidate for the job.\nEight years ago Wrobik left the high-minded and highly advanced Culture for the unabashedly corrupt world of the VEC.  He describes the Culture as a sterile, self-assured communist-bloc utopia, a powerful society with an agenda of hypocritical moral imperialism, backed by Special Circumstances -- \"Dirty Tricks in other words.\"\nAlmost in the background, the xenophobic VEC is waging \"distant wars against aliens, outworlders, subhumans;\"  civilian deaths going unnoted in the news reports.  There have been demonstrations, one of which continues to give Wrobik nightmares \u2014 visions of the human military-machine charging forward.  There is also the \u2018radical\u2019 organization, considered \u2018terrorists\u2019 by most, called \"Bright Path,\" which apparently supplied the gangsters with the rare gun.  Wrobik would be living in the besieged Outworlder\u2019s Quarters himself, but nobody besides Maust, he thought, knew of his alien identity.\nWhile still in the Culture, Wrobik, then Bahlln-Euchersa (etc.), went through a process of \"regendering,\" changing sex (physically), from female to male.   Despite her hopes, her (mental) gender and sexual orientation did not morph along with her body.  Though still a woman in his own mind, since living in the VEC, Wrobik has accepted the identity that society has bestowed upon him: that of a homosexual male, and has found happiness with Maust.  \"I would not be a woman in this society,\" he states, implying that, despite the homophobic society which is shown, this perhaps is the better option.\nWrobik attempts to flee the VEC, in order to avoid his task, which would turn him into not only the murderer of a high official, but possibly hundreds of civilians.   Overheard news that an ambassador from the Culture is to be on the targeted starship as well further dissuades him, and also brings up questions about the true purpose of the attack.  Before Wrobik can skip town (or planet), though, Kaddus and Cruizell get hold of Maust and use him as leverage.  Wrobik is forced to stay and carry out his assignment in order to assure his safety.\nThe story ends with Wrobik completing his mission, the ship fallen and the distant city ablaze with the fire from the explosions.  He never wanted to hurt anyone, but maybe now he is the terrorist.  We do not know his fate; he pockets the gun, and \"[races] down to join all the other poor folk on the run.\""

        "content": "In this story, Asimov describes U.S. Robots' attempt to introduce robots on the planet Earth. Robots have already been in use on space stations and planetary colonies, where the inhabitants are mostly highly trained scientists and engineers.  U.S. Robots faces the problem that on Earth, their robots will encounter a wide variety of people, not all of whom are trustworthy or responsible, yet the Three Laws require robots to obey all human orders and devote equal effort to protecting all human lives.  Plainly, robots must be programmed to differentiate between responsible authorities and those giving random, whimsical orders.\nThe Director of Research designs a new series of robots, the JG series, nicknamed \"George\", to investigate the problem.  The intent is that the George machines will begin by obeying all orders and gradually learn to discriminate rationally, thus becoming able to function in Earth's society.  As their creator explains to George Ten, the Three Laws refer to \"human beings\" without further elaboration, but\u2014quoting Psalm 8:4\u2014\"What is Man that thou art mindful of Him?\" George Ten considers the issue and informs his creator that he cannot progress further without conversing with George Nine, the robot constructed immediately before him.\nTogether, the two Georges decide that human society must be acclimated to a robotic presence.  They advise U.S. Robots to build low-function, non-humanoid machines, such as electronic birds and insects, which can monitor and correct ecological problems.  In this way, humans can become comfortable with robots, thereby greatly easing the transition.  These robotic animals, note the Georges, will not even require the Three Laws, because their functions will be so limited.\nThe story concludes with a conversation between George Nine and George Ten.  Deactivated and placed in storage, they can only speak in the brief intervals when their power levels rise above the standby-mode threshold.  Over what a human would experience as a long time, the Georges discuss the criteria for what constitutes 'responsible authority'- that (A) an educated, principled and rational person should be obeyed in preference to an ignorant, immoral and irrational person, and (B) that superficial characteristics such as skin tone, sexuality, or physical disabilities are not relevant when considering fitness for command.  Given that (A) the Georges are among the most rational, principled and educated persons on the planet, and (B) their differences from normal humans are purely physical, they conclude that in any situation where the Three laws would come into play, their own orders should take priority over that of a regular human.  That in other words, that they are essentially a superior form of human being, and destined to usurp the authority of their makers."

It tells the story of Nausica\u00e4, a princess of a small kingdom on a post-apocalyptic Earth with a toxic ecosystem, who becomes involved in a war between kingdoms while an environmental disaster threatens humankind.\nPrior to creating Nausica\u00e4, Miyazaki had worked as an animator for Toei Animation, Nippon Animation and Tokyo Movie Shinsha (TMS), the latter for whom he had directed his feature directorial debut, Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro (1979). After working on an aborted film adaptation of Richard Corben's comic book Rowlf for TMS, he agreed to create a manga series for Tokuma Shoten's monthly magazine Animage, initially on the condition that it would not be adapted into a film. The development of Nausica\u00e4 was influenced by the Japanese Heian period tale The Lady who Loved Insects, a similarly-named character from Homer's epic poem Odyssey and the Minamata Bay mercury pollution. The setting and visual style of the manga was influenced by M\u0153bius. It was serialized intermittently in Animage from February 1982 to March 1994 and the individual chapters were collected and published by Tokuma Shoten in seven tank\u014dbon volumes. It was serialized with an English translation in North America by Viz Media from 1988 to 1996 as a series of 27 comic book issues and has been published in collected form multiple times.\nSince its initial serialization, Nausica\u00e4 has become a commercial success, particularly in Japan, where the series has more than 17 million copies in circulation. The manga and the 1984 film adaptation, written and directed by Miyazaki and released following the serialization of the manga's first sixteen chapters, received universal acclaim from critics and scholars for its characters, themes, and art. The manga and film versions of Nausica\u00e4 are also credited for the foundation of Studio Ghibli, the animation studio for which Miyazaki created several of his most recognized works."

The series initially ran from the February 1982 issue to the November 1982 issue when the first interruption occurred due to Miyazaki's work related trip to Europe. Serialization resumed in the December issue and the series ran again until June 1983 when it went on hiatus again due to Miyazaki's work on the film adaptation of the series. Serialization of the manga resumed for the third time from the August 1984 issue but halted again in the May 1985 issue when Miyazaki placed the series on hiatus to work on Castle in the Sky. Serialization resumed for the fourth time in the December 1986 issue and was halted again in June 1987 when Miyazaki placed the series on hiatus to work on the films My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service. The series resumed for the fifth time in the April 1990 issue and was halted in the May 1991 issue when Miyazaki worked on Porco Rosso. The series resumed for the final time in the March 1993 issue. The final panel is dated January 28, 1994. The last chapter was released in the March 1994 issue of Animage. By the end Miyazaki had created 59 chapters, of varying length, for publication in the magazine. In an interview, conducted shortly after serialization of the manga had ended, he noted that this amounts to approximately 5 years worth of material. He stated that he did not plan for the manga to run that long and that he wrote the story based on the idea that it could be stopped at any moment.The chapters were slightly modified and collected in seven tank\u014dbon volumes, in soft cover B5 size. The first edition of volume one is dated September 25, 1982. It contains the first eight chapters and was re-released on July 20, 1983 with a newly designed cover and the addition of a dustcover. Volume two has the same July 20, 1983 release date. It contains chapters 9 through 14. Together with chapters 15 and 16, printed in the Animage issues for May and June 1983, these were the only 16 chapters completed prior to the release of the Nausica\u00e4 film in March 1984. The seventh book was eventually released on January 15, 1995. The entire series was also reprinted in two deluxe volumes in hard cover and in A4 size labeled Jokan (\u4e0a\u5dfb, first volume) and Gekan (\u4e0b\u5dfb, final volume) which were released on November 28, 1996. The seven books, which remain in print individually, have also been released in box sets twice, on August 25, 2002 and, with a redesigned box, on October 31, 2003.English translations are published in North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media. As of 2013 Viz Media has released the manga in five different formats. Initially the manga was printed flipped and with English translations of the sound effects. Publication of English editions began in 1988 with the release of episodes from the story under the title Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of Wind in the \"Viz Select Comics\" series.

Viz Media reprinted the manga in four volumes titled Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of Wind: Perfect Collection, which were released from October 1995 to October 1997. A box set of the four volumes was later released in January 2000. In 2004 Viz Media re-released the seven-volume format in an \"Editors Choice\" edition titled Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind. In this version the manga is left unflipped and the sound effects are left untranslated.

        "content": "In 1994, Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind, received the Japan Cartoonists Association Award Grand Prize (\u5927\u8cde, taish\u014d), an annual prize awarded by a panel of association members, consisting of fellow cartoonists.The manga has sold more than 10 million copies in Japan alone. After the 1984 release of the film adaptation, sales for the manga dramatically increased, despite the plot differences between the two works. In the spring of 1994, shortly after serialization had concluded, a combined total of 5.27 million Nausica\u00e4 tank\u014dbon volumes had already been published. At the time Volumes 1 through 6 were in print. Volume 7 was not released until January 15, 1995. By 2005, over 11 million copies had been released for all 7 volumes combined. In December 2020, it was announced that the series had more than 17 million copies in circulation.Nausica\u00e4 was included by Stephen Betts in the comic book\u2013centered reference book 1001 Comics You Must Read Before You Die, who said of the series:\n\nMiyazaki's sepia-inked art is precise, delicate, and detailed. He achieves an incredible dynamism and motion across the page. The rich array of characters, multiple themes, and densely interwoven plot ensure that the message, while worthy, is nuanced. Exploring conflict, politics, and religion, Miyazaki achieves a grand, epic sweep that is rarely seen in comics, and particularly in such a stunning action comic. Yet he also manages to keep the whole story accessible and relevant through the human qualities of his timeless heroine.\nSetre, writing for Japanator, said \"Nasuicaa  [sic] is an amazing manga. And no matter what you may think of Miyazaki this story deserves to be read. It has great characters (some of which could star in their own series), a great sense of adventure and scale, and an awesome story.\"In his July 14, 2001 review of Viz Media's four volume Perfect Collection edition, of the manga, Michael Wieczorek of Ex.org compared the series to Princess Mononoke stating, \"Both stories deal with man's struggle with nature and with each other, as well as with the effects war and violence have on society.\" Wieczoek gave a mixed review on the detail of the artwork in this, 8.08 in \u00d7 5.56 in (20.5 cm \u00d7 14.1 cm) sized, edition, stating, \"It is good because the panels are just beautiful to look at. It is bad because the size of the manga causes the panels within to be very small, and some of these panels are just crammed with detailed artwork. That can sometimes cause some confusion about what is happening to which person during an action scene.\" The Perfect Collection edition of the manga is out of print.In his column House of 1000 Manga for the Anime News Network (ANN) Jason Thompson wrote that \"Nausicaa is as grim as Grave of the Fireflies\". Mike Crandol of ANN praised the manga stating, \"I dare say the manga is Hayao Miyazaki's finest work ever\u2014animated, printed, or otherwise\u2014and that's saying a lot. Manga allows for a depth of plot and character unattainable in the cinematic medium, and Miyazaki uses it to its fullest potential.\"Pamela Gossin and Marc Hairston drew parallels between the Nausica\u00e4 story and On Your Mark, the music video Miyazaki created for the Japanese duo Chage and Aska. They interpreted the release of the winged girl at the end of the music video as Miyazaki setting free his character. Miyazaki started creating On Your Mark the same month the seventh volume of the Nausica\u00e4 manga was released.Kyle Anderson of Nerdist describes the setting as a steampunk post-apocalypse. Philip Boyes of Eurogamer describes the technology in Nausica\u00e4 and Castle in the Sky as dieselpunk."

        "content": "The Dream of Rhonabwy (Welsh: Breuddwyd Rhonabwy) is a Middle Welsh prose tale. Set during the reign of Madog ap Maredudd, prince of Powys (died 1160), its composition is typically dated to somewhere between the late 12th through the late 14th century. It survives in only one manuscript, the Red Book of Hergest, and has been associated with the Mabinogion since its publication by Lady Charlotte Guest in the 19th century. A diplomatic version of the text is published by the University of Wales Press as Breuddwyt Ronabwy, edited by Grafton Melville Richards, first published in 1948. The bulk of the narrative describes a dream vision experienced by its central character, Rhonabwy, a retainer of Madog, in which he visits the time of King Arthur. The text seems to use the fictional trope of time travel."

One night during the pursuit they seek shelter with Heilyn the Red, but find his longhouse filthy and his beds full of fleas. Lying down on a yellow ox-skin, Rhonabwy experiences a dream of Arthur and his time. Serving as his guide is one of Arthur's followers, Iddawg the Churn of Britain, so called because he sparked the Battle of Camlann when he distorted the king's messages of peace he was supposed to deliver to the enemy Medrawd (Mordred). Iddawg introduces Rhonabwy and his friends to Arthur, who regrets that Wales has been inherited by such tiny men.\nIddawg reveals that Arthur's men are assembled to meet the Saxons at the Battle of Mount Badon. However, Arthur is more concerned with a game of gwyddbwyll, a Celtic board game similar to Roman ludus latrunculorum, that he is playing against his follower Owain mab Urien (Ywain). While they play, messengers arrive declaring that Arthur's squires are attacking Owain's ravens; when Owain asks that this be stopped Arthur only responds, \"your move\". Finally Owain orders his ravens to attack Arthur's servants; when Arthur asks him to call them off, Owain says \"your move, lord\". Eventually Arthur crushes the chess pieces into dust, and the two declare peace between their forces. After this the Saxons send a contingent asking for a truce, which Arthur grants after consulting his advisors. Cai (Kay) declares that any who wish to follow Arthur should come to Cornwall. The noise of the troops moving wakes Rhonabwy, who realizes he has slept for three days."

        "content": "There is no consensus about the ultimate meaning of The Dream of Rhonabwy. On one hand it derides Madoc's time, which is critically compared to the illustrious Arthurian age. However, Arthur's time is portrayed as illogical and silly, leading to suggestions that this is a satire on both contemporary times and the myth of a heroic age.Rhonabwy is the most literary of the medieval Welsh prose tales; it may have also been the last written.  A colophon at the end declares that no one is able to recite the work in full without a book, the level of detail being too much for the memory to handle.  The comment suggests the work was not popular with storytellers, though this was more likely due to its position as a literary tale rather than a traditional one."

        "content": "In 1968, while Shueisha was getting prepared to launch its first manga publication, Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump, in order to compete with other magazines from rival companies (like Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine from Kodansha and Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday from Shogakukan), Nagai was invited to be one of the first manga artists publishing in the new magazine. He contemplated this, since he had to design a long-running series instead of the autoconclusive short stories that he had been developing until that point. He accepted, and the series became Nagai's first big success when Sh\u014dnen Jump sold more than one million copies. With Harenchi Gakuen, Nagai became the originator of ecchi manga, opened the door for a series of taboo-shattering gag comics, and also became the symbol of an entire generation. This work has influenced the world of manga, effecting both social mores and what was considered appropriate for manga.Harenchi Gakuen started with the idea of making a manga around a school. Nagai liked the word \"Harenchi\" (scandal), which was used commonly to advertise adult movies. For him, scandal and school were like oil and water, and he thought that mixing them would be funny. At first, Nagai did not have an idea of what stories to develop, but his assistant at the time was boasting about how he had peeped on the girls during their physical examinations from a hole in the roof of his school; this idea was developed into the plot of the manga. Originally, open erotic references did not appear in Harenchi Gakuen. The first physical examination scenes only showed from the shoulders up, but there were a lot of girls drawn, and their images became popular. The editor asked Nagai to go further, which Nagai was eager to do.The inspiration for Harenchi Gakuen came from the West. Nagai liked foreign movies and used to read Playboy magazine and other erotic magazines when he was a child. For the depiction of breasts, he took particular inspiration from the Venus de Milo. According to Nagai, what he in fact drew was not about eroticism per se, but about Japan's culture of shame. He wanted embarrassment to be the eroticism of the stories."

        "content": "Harenchi Gakuen was criticized as vulgar because it introduced overt eroticism to children. Male students and teachers were depicted as being preoccupied with catching glimpses of girls' panties or naked bodies. Many parents, women's associations, and PTAs protested.In particular, the PTA protests over Harenchi Gakuen were notorious. Nagai was bombarded with interview requests from newspapers, magazines and TV. Whenever he flew outside of Tokyo, TV cameras were waiting for him. He was branded a \"nuisance\" and even an \"enemy of society\". He, however, had a clear sense of what things he could or could not do with the manga.At first, Nagai did not think that the opposition was against him, since he was aware of the standards that applied with movies and similar things for an audience below 18 years old. At that time, he never drew sex scenes, avoided pictures of genitals and made nudes cute rather than sexy, though the manga regularly showed male genitals throughout its run, including a castration scene. His fans supported him throughout the PTA protests. They sent him letters where they expressed how they were aware that the adults cracking down on them were reading raunchier stuff than what Nagai was producing.The PTA managed to prevent the distribution of the magazine in some parts of Japan. As a result of the protests, when the series was about to be cancelled because of the PTA, Nagai changed the theme in Harenchi Gakuen into a more mature and serious matter, from nonsense gags with sexy touches, to a full-scale war where murder was depicted in the bloody way for which many know him. This led to the famous ending of Harenchi Gakuen, symbol of freedom and of rejection of the hypocrisy, where all students and teachers, while defending their freedom of expression, are killed by the PTA and other parental forces. This was the ironic answer that Nagai gave to the PTA. (In the end, this was not the actual ending of Harenchi Gakuen, as the title would subsequently return to publication for several years.)The protests were not only against the manga, but also against the TV series, which was also extremely popular and remains one of TV Tokyo's highest-rated programs ever with ratings as high as 32% at its peak."

As a colleague of Watsuki, he worked primarily as a manga assistant, only focusing on his own projects during his days off. He was influenced by street art from hip-hop and rap culture, which is apparent in his manga artwork. For drawing, he used calligraphy inks and pen nibs. When illustrating, he used Copic brand color markers.He chose shamanism as the principal topic of the series because he wanted to choose a subject that had never been approached in manga before. He said he incorporated his own personality and beliefs in Shaman King. He has an interest in the topic, and \"choosing shamanism as the subject of this story seemed like a natural extension of that.\" For the title, he said he used \"shaman\", an English word, due to the fact that \"the nuance is really great\" and because he could not find a Japanese word with the accurate meaning of the word \"shaman\". Another reason to have shamanism as the main subject was because he could explore elements from different cultures and their relationship with the dead and the spirits.Takei created the stories after he created the characters because he believed the \"stories are born because of the existence of the characters\". In addition, he felt that \"the most important thing [to create a character] is to have originality\". Through his characters he wanted to show different cultures, backgrounds and values. When asked \"how do shamans of pacifistic religions ever win the Shaman Fight?\" he answered that the Shaman Fight is fought using the \"strength of the soul\". Takei declared \"the final message of Shaman King is that fighting is no good.\""

Raffles and Bunny are invited to join them dinner at the house of club president Lord Thornaby, ostensibly to discuss the potential of crime in sport (such as gambling and throwing matches), as Raffles is a well-known cricketer. However, on the night of the dinner, Bunny overhears the whispers of two members, and discovers that the club in fact suspect Raffles to be a gentleman thief.\nIn the house, Raffles is too occupied in conversation for Bunny to warn him. At dinner, Raffles and the four men, including a Wild West novelist and a barrister who has sentenced criminals to death, amiably discuss convicted murderers and burglars. Eventually, Lord Thornaby mentions their belief that the same thief committed the burglary on Bond Street and the robbery of Lady Melrose's necklace. Raffles glibly replies that he has connections to the victims of both, and is impressed by the unknown criminal. The group jokes that the criminal might be in the house, and Lord Thornaby, anxious, sends his butler to check the house. The butler returns, and stutters that the bedroom door and dressing-room door are, disturbingly, locked from inside.\nAll the men rush upstairs to investigate. The doors are jammed with wedges screwed with gimlets. Lord Thornaby asks his butler to fetch an emergency rope-ladder, and the novelist bravely climbs down and opens the dressing-room door. The room has been picked and ransacked. Lord Thornaby's parliamentary robes are gone.\nThe men leave the scene to the police, and go to the house's library. The police find a broken clock, which signals that the time of the robbery was during dinner. Raffles is cleanly absolved of all suspicion.\n\nAfterwards, Bunny takes Raffles to his rooms to tell him the truth of the Criminologists' suspicions, only to learn that Raffles had known about them along. In fact, it was Raffles who had committed the burglary of Lord Thornaby's house, the previous night, using a rope-ladder and telescope walking-stick. He had also sneaked in quickly a second time, before dinner, to fake disorder and the broken clock. He had been visiting Bunny's rooms often to use them to spy on the house and prepare his plan. Later, Raffles returns the parliamentary robes to Lord Thornaby anonymously."

Attributed to Benjamin Franklin, the original publication by The Pennsylvania Gazette on May 9, 1754, is the earliest known pictorial representation of colonial union produced by an American colonist in Colonial America.The cartoon is a woodcut showing a snake cut into eighths, with each segment labeled with the initials of one of the American colonies or regions. New England was represented as one segment, rather than the four colonies it was at that time. Delaware was not listed separately as it was part of Pennsylvania. Georgia, however, was omitted completely. As a result, it has eight segments of a snake rather than the traditional 13 colonies. The poster focused solely on the colonies that claimed shared identities as Americans. The cartoon appeared along with Franklin's editorial about the \"disunited state\" of the colonies and helped make his point about the importance of colonial unity. It later became a symbol of colonial freedom during the American Revolutionary War."

        "content": "\"Why Most Published Research Findings Are False\" is a 2005 essay written by John Ioannidis, a professor at the Stanford School of Medicine, and published in PLOS Medicine. It is considered foundational to the field of metascience.\nIn the paper, Ioannidis argued that a large number, if not the majority, of published medical research papers contain results that cannot be replicated. In simple terms, the essay states that scientists use hypothesis testing to determine whether scientific discoveries are significant. Statistical significance is formalized in terms of probability, with its p-value measure being reported in the scientific literature as a screening mechanism. Ioannidis posited assumptions about the way people perform and report these tests; then he constructed a statistical model which indicates that most published findings are likely false positive results."

        "content": "Suppose that in a given scientific field there is a known baseline probability that a result is true, denoted by P(True){\\displaystyle \\mathbb {P} ({\\text{True}})}. When a study is conducted, the probability that a positive result is obtained is P(+){\\displaystyle \\mathbb {P} (+)}. Given these two factors, we want to compute the conditional probability P(True\u2223+){\\displaystyle \\mathbb {P} ({\\text{True}}\\mid +)}, which is known as the positive predictive value (PPV). Bayes' theorem allows us to compute the PPV as:where \u03b1{\\displaystyle \\alpha } is the type I error rate (false positives) and \u03b2{\\displaystyle \\beta } is the type II error rate (false negatives); the statistical power is 1\u2212\u03b2{\\displaystyle 1-\\beta }. It is customary in most scientific research to desire \u03b1=0.05{\\displaystyle \\alpha =0.05} and \u03b2=0.2{\\displaystyle \\beta =0.2}. If we assume P(True)=0.1{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {P} ({\\text{True}})=0.1} for a given scientific field, then we may compute the PPV for different values of \u03b1{\\displaystyle \\alpha } and \u03b2{\\displaystyle \\beta }:\n\nHowever, the simple formula for PPV derived from Bayes' theorem does not account for bias in study design or reporting. Some published findings would not have been presented as research findings if not for researcher bias. Let u\u2208[0,1]{\\displaystyle u\\in [0,1]} be the probability that an analysis was only published due to researcher bias. Then the PPV is given by the more general expression:The introduction of bias will tend to depress the PPV; in the extreme case when the bias of a study is maximized, P(True|+)=P(True){\\displaystyle \\mathbb {P} ({\\text{True}}|+)=\\mathbb {P} ({\\text{True}})}. Even if a study meets the benchmark requirements for \u03b1{\\displaystyle \\alpha } and \u03b2{\\displaystyle \\beta }, and is free of bias, there is still a 36% probability that a paper reporting a positive result will be incorrect; if the base probability of a true result is lower, then this will push the PPV lower too. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that the average statistical power of a study in many scientific fields is well below the benchmark level of 0.8.Given the realities of bias, low statistical power, and a small number of true hypotheses, Ioannidis concludes that the majority of studies in a variety of scientific fields are likely to report results that are false."

        "content": "Despite skepticism about extreme statements made in the paper, Ioannidis's broader argument and warnings have been accepted by a large number of researchers. The growth of metascience and the recognition of a scientific replication crisis have bolstered the paper's credibility, and led to calls for methodological reforms in scientific research.In commentaries and technical responses, statisticians Goodman and Greenland identified several weaknesses in Ioannidis' model.  Ioannidis's use of dramatic and exaggerated language that he \"proved\" that most research findings' claims are false and that \"most research findings are false for most research designs and for most fields\" [italics added] was rejected, and yet they agreed with his paper's conclusions and recommendations. \nBiostatisticians Jager and Leek criticized the model as being based on justifiable but arbitrary assumptions rather than empirical data, and did an investigation of their own which calculated that the false positive rate in biomedical studies was estimated to be around 14%, not over 50% as Ioannidis asserted. Their paper was published in a 2014 special edition of the journal Biostatistics along with extended, supporting critiques from other statisticians. Leek summarized the key points of agreement as: when talking about the science-wise false discovery rate one has to bring data; there are different frameworks for estimating the science-wise false discovery rate; and \"it is pretty unlikely that most published research is false\", but that probably varies by one's definition of \"most\" and \"false\".Statistician Ulrich Schimmack reinforced the importance of the empirical basis for models by noting the reported false discovery rate in some scientific fields is not the actual discovery rate because non-significant results are rarely reported. Ioannidis's theoretical model fails to account for that, but when a statistical method (\"z-curve\") to estimate the number of unpublished non-significant results is applied to two examples, the false positive rate is between 8% and 17%, not greater than 50%."

        "content": "The Electoral Count Act of 1887 (ECA) (Pub. L.Tooltip Public Law (United States) 49\u201390, 24 Stat. 373, later codified at Title 3, Chapter 1) is a United States federal law that added to procedures set out in the Constitution of the United States for the counting of electoral votes following a presidential election.  In its unamended form, it last governed at the time of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count. The Act has since been substantially amended by the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022.\nThe Act was enacted by Congress in 1887, ten years after the disputed 1876 presidential election, in which several states submitted competing slates of electors and a divided Congress was unable to resolve the deadlock for weeks. Close elections in 1880 and 1884 followed, and again raised the possibility that with no formally established counting procedure in place, partisans in Congress might use the counting process to force a desired result.The Act aimed to minimize congressional involvement in election disputes, instead placing the primary responsibility to resolve disputes upon the states. The Act set out procedures and deadlines for the states to follow in resolving disputes, certifying results, and sending the results to Congress. If a state followed these \"safe harbor\" standards and the state's governor properly submitted one set of electoral votes, the Act stated that this \"final\" determination \"shall govern.\" However, making or use of \"any false writing or document\" in the implementation of this procedure was a felony punishable by 5 years imprisonment by 18 U.S. Code 1001 under Chapter 47 Fraud and False Statements. The Act thus relegated Congress to resolving only a narrow class of disputes, such as if a governor had certified two different slates of electors or if a state failed to certify its results under the Act's procedures. Congress could also reject votes under the Act for other specific defects, such as ministerial error, if an elector or candidate was ineligible for office, or if the electoral college votes were not \"regularly given.\"\nThe central provisions of the law were never seriously tested in a disputed election. Since the bill was enacted, some have doubted whether the Act could bind a future Congress. Since the Constitution gives Congress the power to set its own procedural rules, it is possible that simple majorities of the House and Senate could set new rules for the joint session convened to count electoral votes. In the contentious 2000 U.S. presidential election, the law's timing provisions did play a role in court decisions, such as Bush v. Gore. The law has been criticized since it was enacted, with an early commenter describing it as \"very confused, almost unintelligible.\":\u200a643\u200a Modern commenters have stated that the law \"invites misinterpretation\", observing that it is \"turgid and repetitious\", and that \"[i]ts central provisions seem contradictory.\":\u200a543\u200aUnder the Twelfth Amendment, the vice president (as President of the Senate) opens the electoral certificates. The act clarified the vice president's limited role in the count. Both houses could overrule the vice president's decision to include or exclude votes, and under the Act even if the chambers disagree, the governor's certification, not the vice president, broke the tie. On many occasions, the vice president has had the duty of finalizing his party's defeat, and his own on some of those occasions. Richard Nixon, Walter Mondale, Dan Quayle, Al Gore, Dick Cheney, Joe Biden, and Mike Pence all notably presided over counts that handed them, or their party, a loss.The Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022 made changes to the procedures laid out in the Electoral Count Act, along with adding clarifications on the role of the vice president. The proposal was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, which passed during the final days of the 117th United States Congress. The bill was signed into law by President Joe Biden on December 29.  Simple majorities of a new House and Senate could also set new rules for a subsequent joint session convened to count electoral votes unless constitutional provisions were to be enacted."

The Electoral Count Act violates the text and structure of the Constitution in multiple ways. For example, where is the font of express or implied power to pass the Electoral Count Act?  Where does Congress have the power to regulate the manner of presidential election? Where do the Electoral College Clauses provide for bicameralism in counting electoral votes? What gives the 49th Congress (of 1887) the authority to bind future Congresses and joint conventions in counting electoral votes?  More generally: What gives the joint convention the power to judge the validity of electoral votes?  The counting function seems to be arithmetic and ministerial. If the joint convention could judge electoral votes, it could reject enough votes to thwart the electors' will or trigger a contingency election for President in the House of Representatives and for Vice President in the Senate, thereby arrogating to the two Houses of Congress the power to appoint the Nation's two highest executive officers.\nHowever, Kesavan admits:\n\nThe prevailing wisdom, in the Supreme Court and elsewhere, is that the Electoral Count Act is constitutional."

The Hurrians cannot simply leave either: their calculations indicate that if the people of Earth do not destroy their civilization, they will soon develop space travel and, presumably because of their violence, quickly set chaos among the Hurrians' civilization. \nIn desperation, the Hurrians kidnap a human to try to discover why the nuclear war has not happened. The human taunts the Hurrians by calling them vultures, since the Hurrians never try to prevent the nuclear wars, but wait for them to occur and then assist the survivors. After conversing with the human and analyzing his conversation, the Hurrians reach an astounding conclusion. As the inspector, who came to supervise such an unusual case, tells to the resident director of the base, the war will not start by itself; it needs to be \"helped\". Refusing to understand the meaning of the word, the director fearfully asks for clarification, and is told that the Hurrians need to drop an atomic bomb themselves, in order to initiate the conflict which will then escalate on its own. Such a method, while computed to be the only way to start the war, and thus prevent the destruction of advanced space civilizations, is nevertheless completely unacceptable to the Hurrians, a race of absolute pacifists who cannot envision killing a sentient being. \nEven though such an act is needed, explains the director, it simply cannot be done, for no Hurrian will be able to drop the bomb himself, or even order someone else to do so. Unable to solve this dilemma, the Hurrians are forced to return home, plagued by the visions of humans conquering space."

        "content": "After her only daughter, Amy, suffers a crib death, Emily takes up running as a way to deal with her pain. She believes that \"only fast running will do\"\u2014she pushes her body to its limits, often vomiting and sweating profusely. Her husband, Henry, finds out about this habit, and treats it as a psychological reaction to grief. Emily is hurt and runs out of the house, down to a local Holiday Inn. She contacts her father and explains her situation. After their conversation, Emily decides to stay in her father's summer home, near Naples, Florida. She also speaks with Henry, and the two agree that a trial separation is a good idea.\nEmily's life becomes quite simple. She eats plain meals and runs for miles every day. As her body shrinks, she gets to know the few people that hover around the island (Vermillion Key is mostly devoid of tourists). The only person Emily visits is Deke Hollis, an old friend of her father who runs the drawbridge on the island. During a chance meeting, Hollis tells Emily that Jim Pickering, a man who owns an estate on the island, is back. He has brought along a \"niece\"\u2014Hollis's polite name for the young women who Pickering lures to his home. Emily prepares to continue, but Hollis warns her that Pickering is \"not a very nice man.\"\nAs Emily continues her daily run, she notices a shiny red car outside a house along the beach that she deduces belongs to Pickering. When Emily approaches the car and discovers a woman whose throat has been slashed, she is knocked unconscious. She wakes up to find herself inside Pickering's house and bound to a kitchen chair with duct tape. Emily realizes that Pickering is insane, and hints that she let someone know where she was going. When Pickering presses her for details, Emily blurts out Hollis's name; Pickering leaves, presumably to murder the old man.\nEmily knows that she does not have much time, and hears her father's voice in her head, giving her advice. She uses her strong legs to splinter the duct tape and free her lower body. She looks for a knife to release her arms, but settles on the corner of the island in the middle of the kitchen. Now freed, Emily attacks Pickering when he returns. After temporarily knocking him out, Emily escapes from his house and makes it to the beach. She hears Pickering behind her and realizes, in a rather odd coincidence, that she has been \"training\" for this moment.\nThough exhausted from her imprisonment, Emily's months of running serve her well. She keeps well ahead of Pickering, who has armed himself with a pair of scissors. Emily encounters a young Latino man on the beach and begs for help, but he doesn't understand her cries. Pickering appears and tries to use Spanish to convince the man that Emily is with him, but Emily's fearful expression convinces the young man otherwise. Enraged, Pickering brutally slaughters the man with his scissors.\nEmily, tiring quickly, runs into the ocean. Pickering follows her, but begins to flounder. Emily gasps as she figures out what is happening\u2014Pickering cannot swim. Emily manages to escape him, and sits on the shoreline to watch as Pickering drowns. When he finally goes under, Emily tells herself that a shark or some other creature attacked him. She wonders why, and guesses that it is a part of the human condition. Her long ordeal over, Emily stands and shouts at the birds flying about, and prepares to go home."

        "content": "\"The Imperialism of Free Trade\" is an academic article by John Gallagher and Ronald Robinson first published in The Economic History Review in 1953. The article was influential in the debate concerning the causes of British imperial expansion in the 19th-century which, since John A. Hobson's Imperialism: A Study (1902), had focused on economic motivation. Instead, Gallagher and Robinson claimed that the New Imperialism \u2013 \"the new spate of imperial expansion that gathered momentum from the 1880s\" \u2013 could be best characterised as a continuation of a longer-term policy begun in the 1850s in which informal empire, based on the principles of free trade, was favoured over formal imperial control unless circumstances made such rule impossible. As well as reigniting scholarly interest in theorizing New Imperialism, the article helped launch the Cambridge School of historiography.\nThe arguments proposed in the article were later developed in a full-length book, Africa and the Victorians (1961), in conjunction with Alice Denny. The book put forward a subtly different explanation for European expansion in Africa, built around geopolitics and a strategy of protecting British India from encroachment by other European powers. The strategic model and its relevance to East Africa was criticised for its limited documentary basis and sequential inconsistencies by John Darwin in 1997, a refutation that was further consolidated and contextualised by Jonas Gjers\u00f8 in 2015.Reviewing the debate from the end of the 20th century, historian  Martin Lynn argues that Gallagher and Robinson exaggerated its impact. He says that Britain achieved its goal of increasing its economic interests in many areas, \"but the broader goal of 'regenerating' societies and thereby creating regions tied as 'tributaries' to British economic interests was not attained.\" The reasons were:\n\nthe aim to reshape the world through free trade and its extension overseas owed more to the misplaced optimism of British policy-makers and their partial views of the world than to an understanding of the realities of the mid-19th century globe.... the volumes of trade and investment...the British were able to generate remained limited....Local economies and local regimes proved adept at restricting the reach of British trade and investment.  Local impediments to foreign inroads, the inhabitants' low purchasing power, the resilience of local manufacturing, and the capabilities of local entrepreneurs meant that these areas effectively resisted British economic penetration.\nThe idea that free-trade imperial states use informal methods to secure their expanding economic influence has attracted Marxist historiographers to use the theory to describe how the modern economic policies of the United States and the imperialist policies of Great Britain are essentially the same, in both motive and method."

It tells the story of Yusuke Urameshi, a teenage delinquent who is struck and killed by a car while attempting to save a child's life. After a number of tests presented to him by Koenma, the son of the ruler of the afterlife, Yusuke is revived and appointed the title of \"Underworld Detective\". With this title he must investigate various cases involving demons and apparitions in the Human World, with the manga gradually becoming more focused on martial arts battles and tournaments as it progresses. Togashi began creating YuYu Hakusho around November 1990, basing the series on his interests in the occult and horror films and an influence of Buddhist mythology.\nThe manga was originally serialized in Shueisha's sh\u014dnen manga magazine Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump from December 1990 to July 1994. It consists of 175 chapters collected in 19 tank\u014dbon volumes. In North America, the manga is licensed by Viz Media, who first serialized it in Shonen Jump from January 2003 to January 2010. An anime adaptation consisting of 112 television episodes was directed by Noriyuki Abe and co-produced by Fuji Television, Yomiko Advertising, and Studio Pierrot. The anime series originally aired on Japan's Fuji TV network from October 1992 to December 1994, and was later licensed in North America by Funimation in 2001, where it aired on Cartoon Network blocks including Adult Swim and later Toonami. The series has also been published and broadcast in various other countries around the world. The YuYu Hakusho franchise has spawned two animated films, a series of original video animations (OVAs), a live-action television series, audio albums, video games, and other merchandise.\nYuYu Hakusho has been well received; the manga has over 78 million copies in circulation worldwide, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. It also won the 39th Shogakukan Manga Award for the sh\u014dnen category in 1993. The animated series won the Animage Anime Grand Prix prize for best anime in 1994 and 1995. The series has been well received by a large audience in Japan and a wide range of age groups in the United States. The anime has been given mostly positive reviews by critics in North America, complimenting its writing, characters, comedy, and amount of action."

His ghost is greeted by Botan, a woman who introduces herself as the pilot of the Sanzu River, who ferries souls to the Underworld (\u970a\u754c, Reikai, \"Spirit World\" in the English anime dub) where they may be judged for the afterlife. Botan informs Yusuke that his act had caught even the Underworld by surprise and that there was not yet a place made for him in either heaven or hell. Thus Koenma, son of the Underworld's ruler King Enma, offers Yusuke a chance to return to his body through a series of tests. Yusuke succeeds with the help of his friends Keiko Yukimura and Kazuma Kuwabara. After returning to life, Koenma grants Yusuke the title of \"Underworld Detective\" (\u970a\u754c\u63a2\u5075, Reikai Tantei, lit. \"Spirit World Detective\", \"Spirit Detective\" in the English dub), charging him with investigating supernatural activity within the Human World (\u4eba\u9593\u754c, Ningen Kai). Soon Yusuke is off on his first case, retrieving three treasures stolen from the Underworld by a gang of demons: Hiei, Kurama, and Goki. Yusuke collects the three treasures with the aid of his new technique, the Rei Gun, a shot of aura or Reiki (\u970a\u6c17, Reiki, lit. \"Spirit Energy\") fired mentally from his index finger. He then travels to the mountains in search of the aged, female martial arts master Genkai. Together with his rival Kuwabara, Yusuke fights through a tournament organized by Genkai to find her successor. Yusuke uses the competition as a cover to search for Rando, a demon who steals the techniques of martial arts masters and kills them. Yusuke defeats Rando in the final round of the tournament and trains with Genkai for several months, gaining more mastery over his aura. Yusuke is then sent to Labyrinth Castle in the Demon Plane (\u9b54\u754c, Makai, lit. \"Demon World\"), a third world occupied solely by demons, where Kuwabara and the newly reformed Kurama and Hiei assist him in defeating the Four Beasts, a quartet of demons attempting to blackmail Koenma into removing the barrier keeping them out of the Human World.\nYusuke's next case sends him on a rescue mission, where he meets Toguro, a human turned into a demon. To test his strength, Toguro invites Yusuke to the Dark Tournament (\u6697\u9ed2\u6b66\u8853\u4f1a, Ankoku Bujutsukai, lit. \"Dark Martial Arts Association\"), an event put on by corrupt, rich humans in which teams of demons, and occasionally humans, fight fierce battles for the chance to receive any wish they desire. Team Urameshi, consisting of Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, Hiei, and a disguised Genkai, traverse through the strenuous early rounds to face Team Toguro in the finals and win the tournament. They learn that Team Toguro's owner, Sakyo, was attempting to win to create a large hole from the Human World to the Demon Plane and allow countless demons through. With his loss, Sakyo destroys the tournament arena, killing himself in the process.\nAfter the tournament, Yusuke returns home but has little time to rest as he is challenged to a fight by three teenagers possessing superhuman powers and who end up taking the detective hostage. Kuwabara and the others rescue him and learn that the whole scenario was a test put on by Genkai. It is disclosed that Shinobu Sensui, Yusuke's predecessor as Underworld Detective, has recruited six other powerful beings to help him take over where Sakyo left off, opening a hole to the Demon Plane to cause genocide of the human race. Yusuke and his friends challenge and defeat Sensui's associates one-by-one, culminating in a final battle between the two detectives. Sensui kills Yusuke then retreats into the newly opened portal to the Demon Plane. Yusuke is reborn as a partial demon, discovering that his ancestor passed down a recessive gene that would hide until an heir with sufficient power surfaced when his demonic lineage would be revealed. Yusuke travels to the Demon Plane and defeats Sensui with the aid of his ancestor who takes control of Yusuke's body to finish the fight.\nAs they return to the Human World, Yusuke is stripped of his detective title in fear that Yusuke's demon blood could cause him to go on a rampage in the Human World. Yusuke, unsettled at having been controlled by his ancestor Raizen, accepts an offer by Raizen's followers to return to the Demon Plane. Raizen, desiring a successor to his territory, is on the brink of dying of starvation, a death that would topple the delicate political balance of the three ruling powers of the Demon Plane. Hiei and Kurama are summoned by the other two rulers, Mukuro and Yomi, respectively, to prepare for an inevitable war. The three protagonists train in the realm for one year, during which time Raizen dies and Yusuke inherits his territory. Yusuke takes the initiative and proposes a fighting tournament to name the true ruler of the Demon Plane, which is agreed upon by Mukuro and Yomi. During the tournament, Yusuke and Yomi meet in the second elimination round where Yusuke is defeated. Yusuke hopes a similar competition will be held every few years to determine the Demon Plane's ruler. \nTwo years later, Yusuke returns to the Human World while Hiei stays with Mukuro and protects humans who have accidentally wandered into the Demon Plane. After learning that King Enma was falsifying reports on demon activity against humans in order to justify keeping the two separated, Koenma takes over his father's position and allows access between the Demon Plane and Human World. Genkai dies and leaves her estate to the main characters. The story ends with Yusuke and his friends reuniting at a beach."

        "title": "YuYu Hakusho_p1",
        "content": "Author Yoshihiro Togashi stated that he began working on YuYu Hakusho during a period of time around November 1990, though he forgot the exact time. He had recently completed the serialization of his romantic comedy Ten de Sh\u014dwaru Cupid in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump. Having felt somewhat intimidated by some of his more popular fellow authors during this manga's run, Togashi realized he would need to create a fighting manga to both gain popularity and write something he enjoyed. As a fan of the occult and horror films, he desired to write and illustrate a new manga based on his interests. Togashi had previously published an occult detective fiction manga titled Occult Tanteidan, of which he referenced positive reception from readers as a reason for continuing to create manga. When first producing YuYu Hakusho, he did not have a clear idea of what he wanted to call it. He used the tentative title \"How to be a Ghost\" while presenting rough drafts to his editors. Once given the go-ahead to begin publication, Togashi proposed \"YuYu-Ki\" (Poltergeist Chronicles) for the title, as there would be battles with demons and it would be a play on the title SaiYu-Ki. However, a series with a similar name (Chin-Yu-Ki) had already begun publication, so Togashi quickly created an alternative: \"YuYu Hakusho\" (Poltergeist Report). He commented that he could have used \"Den\" (Legend) or \"Monogatari\" (Story), but \"Hakusho\" (Report) was the first thing that came to his mind. He contiguously developed the names of the main characters by skimming through a dictionary and taking out kanji characters he found appealing. \"Yusuke Urameshi\" is a pun, \"Kazuma Kuwabara\" is a combination of two professional baseball players, and \"Hiei\" and \"Kurama\" are \"just names that popped into [Togashi's] head.\" When he introduced the latter two characters in volume three, the author had early plans to make Kurama a main character but was not certain about Hiei.The manga's shift from occult detective fiction to the martial arts genre after Yusuke's death and revival in the early chapters was planned by Togashi from the beginning. He took this idea from the series Kinnikuman, which began largely as a comedy before concentrating more on action. Togashi's intention was to establish the main characters and familiarize the reader with them before placing them in tense, physical conflicts. His editor at the time was nervous of him beginning the manga this way and recommended he transition to a battle-focused plot after about 30 chapters. YuYu Hakusho borrows many elements from Asian folklore, particularly Buddhist beliefs in the afterlife. Togashi came up with the concept of the Ningenkai (Human World), Reikai (Underworld), and Makai (Demon Plane) as being parallel planes of existence in the manga's universe. He thought of them as places that one could not easily travel between using modern technology, but rather as a spirit lacking a material body. However, the idea for the \"territory\" powers from the Sensui story arc was parodied from a separate, unnamed work by Yasutaka Tsutsui. For his drawing materials, Togashi used drafting ink and Kabura pens throughout the creation of the series. While his style of artwork began with screentone, he gradually developed into minimalism. As the series progressed, he would draw figures and faces very detailed or \"cartoony, sketchy and jumping with action\" whenever he desired such effects.During the years he worked on YuYu Hakusho, Togashi would calculate the personal time he had based on a formula of four hours per page without scripting and five hours of sleep per night. He wrote in his own d\u014djinshi Yoshirin de Pon! that he stopped the production on YuYu Hakusho out of selfishness. The author had originally wanted to end the manga in December 1993, at the climax of the Sensui arc. Although there was not a large demand from the editorial staff, Togashi was under a great deal of personal stress at certain points of the series' run, particularly during its final six months of publication. He claimed that, beginning with the Dark Tournament arc, inconsistent sleep resulting from overwork was causing him health problems. He noted himself as being very ill while working on the color pages for Yusuke's match with Chu. There were also many instances where he would create nearly entire manuscripts by himself, such as Yusuke's meeting with Raizen and the battle between Kurama and Karasu. The editors of the publication tried to make Togashi reconsider cancelling Yu Yu Hakusho, though he justified his decision by stating that it would simply be replaced by another popular series. Togashi was relieved at the conclusion of the manga. The author claimed to not have been involved in the production of the YuYu Hakusho anime adaptation due to his own work schedule. He stated that he was greatly impressed by Shigeru Chiba's voice depiction of Kuwabara, admitting that the voice actor understood the character better than Togashi himself."

        "content": "The 1890 Manifesto (also known as the Woodruff Manifesto, the Anti-polygamy Manifesto, or simply \"the Manifesto\") is a statement which officially advised against any future plural marriage in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Issued by Church President Wilford Woodruff in September 1890, the Manifesto was a response to mounting anti-polygamy pressure from the United States Congress, which by 1890 had disincorporated the church, escheated its assets to the U.S. federal government, and imprisoned many prominent polygamist Mormons. Upon its issuance, the LDS Church in conference accepted Woodruff's Manifesto as \"authoritative and binding.\"\nThe Manifesto was a dramatic turning point in the history of the LDS Church. It advised church members against entering into any marriage prohibited by the law of the land, and made it possible for Utah to become a U.S. state. Nevertheless, even after the Manifesto, the church quietly continued to perform a small number of plural marriages in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, thus necessitating a Second Manifesto during U.S. congressional hearings in 1904. Though neither Manifesto dissolved existing plural marriages, plural marriage in the LDS Church gradually died by attrition during the early-to-mid 20th century. The Manifesto was canonized in the LDS Church standard works as Official  Declaration 1 and is considered by mainstream Mormons to have been prompted by divine revelation (although not a revelation itself), in which Woodruff was shown that the church would be thrown into turmoil if they did not comply with it. Some Mormon fundamentalists rejected the manifesto."

        "content": "The Manifesto was issued in response to the anti-polygamy policies of the federal government of the United States, and most especially the Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act of 1887. This law disincorporated the LDS Church and authorized the federal government to seize all of the church's assets. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the provisions of the Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act in Late Corporation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. United States in May 1890.In April 1889, Woodruff, the president of the church, began privately refusing the permission that was required to contract new plural marriages. In October 1889, Woodruff publicly admitted that he was no longer approving new polygamous marriages, and in answer to a reporter's question of what the LDS Church's attitude was toward the law against polygamy, Woodruff stated, \"We mean to obey it. We have no thought of evading it or ignoring it.\" Because it had been Mormon practice for over 25 years to either evade or ignore anti-polygamy laws, Woodruff's statement was a signal that a change in church policy was developing.In February 1890, the Supreme Court had already ruled in Davis v. Beason that a law in Idaho Territory which disenfranchised individuals who practiced or believed in plural marriage was constitutional. That decision left the Mormons no further legal recourse to their current marriage practices and made it unlikely that without change Utah Territory would be granted statehood.Woodruff later said that on the night of September 23, 1890, he received a revelation from Jesus Christ that the church should cease the practice of plural marriage. The following morning, he reported this to some of the general authorities and placed the hand-written draft on a table. George Reynolds would later recount that he, Charles W. Penrose, and John R. Winder modified Woodruff's draft into the current language accepted by the general authorities and presented to the church as a whole. Woodruff announced the Manifesto on September 25 by publishing it in the church-owned Deseret Weekly in Salt Lake City. On October 6, 1890, it was formally accepted by the church membership, though many held reservations or abstained from voting.Utah ratified its constitution in November 1895 and was granted statehood on January 4, 1896. One of the conditions for granting Utah statehood was that a ban on polygamy be written into their state constitution."

We are not teaching polygamy or plural marriage, nor permitting any person to enter into its practice, and I deny that either forty or any other number of plural marriages have during that period been solemnized in our Temples or in any other place in the Territory.\nOne case has been reported, in which the parties allege that the marriage was performed in the Endowment House, in Salt Lake City, in the Spring of 1889, but I have not been able to learn who performed the ceremony; whatever was done in this matter was without my knowledge. In consequence of this alleged occurrence the Endowment House was, by my instructions, taken down without delay.\nInasmuch as laws have been enacted by Congress forbidding plural marriages, which laws have been pronounced constitutional by the court of last resort, I hearby declare my intention to submit to those laws, to use my influence with the members of the Church over which I preside to have them do likewise.\nThere is nothing in my teachings to the Church or in those of my associates, during the time specified, which can be reasonably construed to inculcate or encourage polygamy; and when any Elder of the Church has used language which appeared to convey such teaching, he has been promptly reproved. And I now publicly declare that my advice to the Latter-day Saints is to refrain from contracting any marriage forbidden by the law of the land.\nWilford Woodruff [signed]\n\nPresident of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."

However, Congress still refused to seat representatives-elect who were polygamists, including B. H. Roberts.D. Michael Quinn and other Mormon historians have documented that some church apostles covertly sanctioned plural marriages after the Manifesto. This practice was especially prevalent in Mexico and Canada because of an erroneous belief that such marriages were legal in those jurisdictions. However, a significant minority were performed in Utah and other western American states and territories. The estimates of the number of post-Manifesto plural marriages performed range from scores to thousands, with the actual figure probably close to 250. Today, the LDS Church officially acknowledges that although the Manifesto \"officially ceased\" the practice of plural marriage in the church, \"the ending of the practice after the Manifesto was ... gradual.\"Rumors of post-Manifesto marriages surfaced and began to be examined by Congress in the Reed Smoot hearings. In response, church president Joseph F. Smith issued a \"Second Manifesto\" in  1904 which reaffirmed the church's opposition to the creation of new plural marriages and threatened excommunication for Latter-day Saints who continued to enter into  or solemnize new plural marriages. Apostles John W. Taylor and Matthias F. Cowley both resigned from the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles due to disagreement with the church's position on plural marriage. Plural marriage in violation of local law continues to be grounds for excommunication from the LDS Church.The cessation of plural marriage within LDS Church gave rise to the Mormon fundamentalist movement."

However, when the Manifesto was issued, it was not apparent that Woodruff or the other leaders of the LDS Church viewed it as the result of a divine revelation.Approximately one year after he declared the Manifesto, Woodruff began to claim that he had received instructions from Jesus Christ that formed the basis of what he wrote in the text of the Manifesto. These instructions were reportedly accompanied by a vision of what would occur if the Manifesto were not issued.Following Woodruff's death in 1898, other church leaders began to teach that the Manifesto was the result of a revelation of God. Since that time, church leaders have consistently taught that the Manifesto was inspired of God. In 1908, the Manifesto was printed in the LDS Church's Doctrine and Covenants for the first time, and it has been included in every edition since. A non-Mormon observer of the church has stated that \"[t]here is no question that, from a doctrinal standpoint, President Woodruff's Manifesto now has comparable status with [Joseph Smith's] revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants.\" Similarly, another writer has stated bluntly that \"contemporary Latter-day Saints regard the Manifesto as a revelation.\" The Manifesto is currently published as \"Official Declaration 1\" in the Doctrine and Covenants."

Residents of nearby towns, including Booth, know this and live in unspoken fear, wearing religious symbols for protection and never venturing near the area. One night, Booth and his friend, bar owner Herb \"Tookey\" Tooklander, attempt to rescue the wife and daughter of a motorist named Gerard Lumley, whose vehicle is stranded in a ferocious blizzard. Initially contemptuous of Lumley for driving in such weather, both are horrified upon realizing that his vehicle is stranded in Jerusalem's Lot. They reluctantly drive out in an International Scout with Lumley to try to save his wife and daughter, fearing the worst.\nThe three locate Lumley's Mercedes still running and heated but nonetheless abandoned. The two men, realizing what has likely happened to Lumley's family, try to get him to leave with them, but Lumley refuses and stumbles around in the snow, calling for his wife and daughter. Lumley's wife emerges from the dark and Lumley hurries toward her; he notices her fanged teeth and red eyes too late and is bitten. Booth nearly falls victim to Lumley's daughter, but Tookey throws a Douay Bible at her as both men scramble into the Scout, quickly fleeing the area.\nBooth concludes by saying Tookey died of a heart attack a couple of years after the incident. He mentions that he has nightmares about that night and about Lumley's daughter, and warns the reader that if they are in the area, to never go up the road into Jerusalem's Lot for any reason, especially at night, lest the reader encounters Lumley's daughter, the little girl who is \"still waiting for her goodnight kiss\"."

        "content": "\"Das Judenthum in der Musik\" (German for Judaism in Music, but perhaps more accurately understood in contemporary language as Jewishness in Music), is an essay by composer Richard Wagner which criticizes the influence of Jews and their \"essence\" on European art music, arguing that they have not contributed to its development but have rather commodified and degraded it. \nIt alleges that Jews infiltrated the music industry not through their artistic capabilities, but because of their control over financial resources. In particular it discusses the music of Jewish composers Felix Mendelssohn and Giacomo Meyerbeer, acknowledging its technical proficiency but criticizing it as lacking genuine artistic passion. According to Wagner, authentic art is rooted in immersion within the organic life of a culture, and Jews, indicated as being outsiders to this culture, are capable of only making artificial or superficial contributions.\nIt was first published under a pseudonym in the Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik (NZM) of Leipzig in September 1850. It was republished in 1869, this time bearing Wagner's name, with expanded commentary on the original publication's purpose, response and the purported negative impact on Wagner and his associate's careers."

        "content": "There is debate over the translation of the title, Das Judenthum in der Musik, into English. The article's first translator, William Ashton Ellis, gave it the title Judaism in Music. \"Judaism\" in modern English tends to refer to the Abrahamic religion of the Jews. \"Judenthum\" however in 19th-century Germany carried a much broader meaning, including the culture and social practices of the Jews. It also carried a pejorative sense associating Jews with money-making. Karl Marx in his 1843 essay On the Jewish Question uses the word in this sense, in which he associates Jews intrinsically with capitalist enterprise. Wagner also intended this latter dual meaning, given the context of the essay in which he uses \"Judenthum\" almost synonymously with \"commercialism\"; this usage is also reflected in his personal letters.Wagner's essay primarily attacks Jewish culture, artistic taste, and alleged economic power and commercialism, rather than the Jewish race or religion. In the essay Wagner speaks of the need to emancipate both Jews and non-Jews from \"Judenthum\". For this reason, alternative translations of the title have been given, including Jewishness in Music and Jewry in Music.The essay was written during his exile in Z\u00fcrich after participating in the May Uprising in Dresden, part of the Revolutions of 1848. It follows Art and Revolution and The Artwork of the Future in a series of polemical essays intended to provoke controversy and discussion over the purpose and future direction of European art. Wagner had a radical mindset at the time, and was formulating what would become his magnum opus, the 16-hour long music drama Der Ring des Nibelungen, with which he intended to revitalize German art and society, which he perceived to be in decline.\nIn these previous essays, Wagner criticized the perceived shallowness of the then-popular French grand opera, such as that of the celebrated Jewish composer Giacomo Meyerbeer. Wagner was emboldened to write again on the subject, this time from a fully antisemitic perspective, after learning of the great success of Meyerbeer's 1849 opera Le proph\u00e8te, and reading a series of essays written by his close associate Theodor Uhlig, criticizing Le proph\u00e8t as exemplifying inferior \"Hebrew artistic taste\"."

        "content": "The first version of the article appeared in the NZM under the pseudonym of K. Freigedank (\"K. Freethought\"). In an April 1851 letter to Franz Liszt, Wagner stated that he used a pseudonym \"not out of fear, but to prevent the question being dragged down by the Jews to a purely personal level\". Ironically, this same letter also reveals Wagner's deep personal antipathy for Meyerbeer as partially motivating the essay, who reminds him of the \u201cdarkest\u201d period of his life.\nIn the essay, Wagner criticizes the artistry of Jews. Wagner argues that Jewish participation in European music represents not a contribution to its enrichment, but rather a symptom of a cultural epoch in decline.\nWagner uses Felix Mendelssohn and a contemporary, unnamed Jewish opera composer (Meyerbeer) as examples to argue that while Jewish artists may achieve technical proficiency, their works ultimately fail to resonate deeply with the spirit of true artistry. This disconnect stems from an inherent outsider perspective that Jewish artists have towards European cultural traditions, which prevents them from creating art that genuinely reflects these traditions' spirit. \nWagner\u2019s negative assessment of Meyerbeer's music was not in isolation, but was in fact in tune with the prevailing critical consensus in Germany at the time, according to which Meyerbeer's works displayed \"rhythmic monotony and undue eclecticism, elevating contrived effect above genuine dramatic tension\". Wagner accuses Meyerbeer's audience in Paris as seeking cheap distractions from their boredom, rather than desiring engagement with a real art that challenges and elevates them.\nWagner reflects on an emotional \"instinctive repulsion\" towards Jews that remains in European society at large despite high-minded liberal social emancipation efforts, and a lack of genuine integration or acceptance of Jews. Wagner argues this repulsion needs to be acknowledged and discussed, rather than suppressed and ignored, so once the specific details of its triggering are understood, could steps be taken to resolve the social friction between Jews and non-Jews.\nDespite calls for understanding and reconciliation, the essay is rife with insulting and provocative antisemitism. Wagner harshly attacks the Hebrew language, speech patterns, and appearance of Jews as aesthetically unpleasing and unsuited for artistic expression. In one metaphor, Wagner suggests that just as worms consume a body after it has died, so do Jews take over a European culture's music after its native vitality has diminished."

He and ten other professors at the Leipzig Conservatory requested that Brendel resign from the Conservatory's board. Brendel kept his position.

        "content": "Seeking to explain to friends the source of the unprecedented hostility towards himself and his artwork by music critics in the press, Wagner republished his essay in 1869 under his own name along with expanded commentary on the original's purpose and reception. Some edits were made to the original 1850 text, toning down its offensive language.\nWagner defends his use of a pseudonym in the original publication of the essay, having wanted to prevent the discussion from being diverted to personal matters, which he believed would happen if his real name was attached. Despite this, Wagner was soon recognized as the essay's author. \nAccording to Wagner, while the original essay itself was ignored in an effort to stifle the conversation it sought to provoke, critics pivoted to attacking him in other areas, such as his other published art writings and stage works, in a \"reverse persecution\" by the Jewish intelligentsia which Wagner asserts controls the press. This included the significant mocking of himself and Liszt as the \"prophets\" of the \"Music of the Future\" in the newspapers, led by music critic Eduard Hanslick, who initially supported Wagner but later turned on him around 1854, with his publication of On the Beautiful in Music. Hanslick's theory of aesthetic beauty based on formal structure, which Wagner derides in his essay as \"Jewish\", was at odds with Wagner's own theories based on relatively formless passionate expression. \nWagner argues at length against Hanslick's \"Music Judaism\", which includes not just Jewish musicians but any composer who adopts this diluted style. He cites Robert Schumann as a composer whose youthful and spirited compositions turned superficial and pretentious in later years due to the influence of \"Music Judaism\".\nIn closing, Wagner appeals to the Jewish people directly, acknowledging the significant talents and virtues within Jewish society and suggesting that the oppression faced by the German spirit under Judaism is even more burdensome for the Jews themselves. Wagner expresses a hope, albeit faint, that by being openly critical of their relationship with Judaism, it might encourage even those within the Jewish community to fight for their true emancipation. He argues for the necessity of openly addressing the challenges of assimilating the Jewish people into German culture, not to halt cultural decline through exclusion, but to foster a shared development towards higher human qualities."

        "content": "Once again many of Wagner's supporters were troubled by the essay's provocation. By this time, Wagner was a well-known public figure and the publication brought many responses in the press. Productions of Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg were hissed, and a Berlin production of Lohengrin had to be delayed. Ironically, when the Lohengrin production proceeded, it was enthusiastically received by the Jews in attendance. When Wagner heard this news, he was dismayed at the implication that the Jews had \"forgiven\" him for having written the \"hasty\" article, rather than grasped its true purpose.Despite making his anti-Jewish sentiments publicly known, Wagner enjoyed close friendships with a circle of notable Jews. These included the conductor Hermann Levi (who premiered Parsifal in 1882), the pianists Carl Tausig and Joseph Rubinstein, the writer Heinrich Porges, and others.\nIn his later years, Wagner's antipathy towards Jews and \"Judenthum\" would soften as he became more humanist, less focused on politics and more concerned with metaphysical and spiritual matters. Heavily influenced by the philosophy of Schopenhauer and the Indian religions Buddhism and Hinduism, Wagner came to regard the true problem facing humanity as what he called Weltenwahn: \"World-madness\", similar to the concept of Maya in these religions: a delusion blinding society brought on by materialism, greed, and lust for power, which perpetuates human suffering. Wagner would name his final private residence in Bayreuth as Wahnfried: \"Peace-from-madness\".\nRather than needing emancipation from \"Judenthum\", Wagner notes in his late essay \"Know Thyself\" (Erkenne dich Selbst, 1881) that this \"madness\" arises from within German society itself just as much as Jewish society, though Germans blame their troubles on external elements like the Jews rather than identifying the source within themselves. Wagner writes  of the need for a spiritual awakening for all of humanity to realize their shared \"simple, sacred dignity\". Only once society has woken up, will there \"be no more Jews\", not due to their physical eradication, or even loss of their essence due to assimilation, but because such a noble process will result in the end of division and conflict based on all such superficial identities, with humanity recognizing itself as one. These themes are explored in his final opera, Parsifal.\nThat Wagner wanted nothing to do with the racial antisemitic movements growing in the late 19th century at the time, positing notions of superior and inferior races which would become the foundation of Nazism, is confirmed in his private letters:\n\nFrom the modern antisemitic movement I stand completely distant. In an upcoming issue of the Bayreuth Bl\u00e4tter there will appear an article ['Know Thyself'] by me that ardently announces that it will actually be impossible for me to associate myself with that movement.\nDespite these sentiments, after Wagner's death in 1883, racialist antisemites such as the British-born Houston Stewart Chamberlain and Winifred Williams would descend on Bayreuth and its annual festival, taking it over, expelling Jewish musicians, and transforming it into a theater for the Nazis to subject Wagner's stage works to racist interpretations, with Adolf Hitler appearing there often as an honored guest."

While Hitler owned several of Wagner's music manuscripts as prized posessions, there is no evidence Hitler and other Nazi leadership members read Das Judenthum or were even aware of its existence. As the essay was largely regarded as an embarrassment to the early Wagnerites, there was just one reprint of the essay in Weimar in 1914, before the Nazis came to power. During the Nazi era there were two further publications: in Berlin in 1934 and in Leipzig in 1939. None of these appear to have been large editions with significant readership.\nDespite the limited impact of the essay's publications on German cultural affairs, it has since served as an important document to understand the nature of Wagner's antisemitic worldview and whether this antisemitism is present in his stage works. Scholars such as Theodor Adorno have asserted that it is present, but this is strongly disputed by others. The topic remains under considerable debate in both academia and amongst the opera-going public. With a few controversial exceptions, Wagner has not been publically performed in what is today the modern state of Israel since 1938.\nSome writers such as Bryan Magee have sought to make a qualified defence of Wagner's originality of thought in Das Judenthum, despite acknowledging its malevolence. However, other scholars argue a more comprehensive consideration of the essay's contents weakens his argument. Music historians have written to debunk the anti-Jewish thesis and arguments appearing in Wagner's essay."

The third major influence was Tristram Shandy from which Carlyle quotes many phrases, and to which he referred in earlier letters.\nCarlyle worked on an earlier novel, Wotton Reinfred, which MacMechan refers to as \"[t]he first draft of Sartor.\" Carlyle finished seven chapters of the semi-autobiographical novel depicting a young man of deeply religious upbringing being scorned in love, and thereafter wandering. He eventually finds at least philosophical consolation in a mysterious stranger named Maurice Herbert, who invites Wotton into his home and frequently discusses speculative philosophy with him. At this point, the novel abruptly shifts to highly philosophical dialogue revolving mostly around Kant. Though the unfinished novel deeply impressed Carlyle's wife Jane, (n\u00e9e Welsh) Carlyle never published it and its existence was forgotten until long after Carlyle's death. MacMechan suggests that the novel provoked Carlyle's frustration and scorn due to the \"zeal for truth and his hatred for fiction\" he speaks of in his letters of the time. Numerous parts of Wotton appear in the biographical section of Sartor Resartus, where Carlyle humorously turns them into Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's autobiographical sketches, which the editor constantly complains are overly fragmented or derivative of Goethe. Though widely and erroneously reported as having been burned by Carlyle, the unfinished novel is still extant in draft form; several passages were moved verbatim to Sartor Resartus, but with their context radically changed.Carlyle had difficulty finding a publisher for the novel, and he began composing it as an article in October 1831 at Craigenputtock. Fraser's Magazine serialised it in 1833\u20131834. The text would first appear in volume form in Boston in 1836, its publication arranged by Ralph Waldo Emerson, who much admired the book and Carlyle. Emerson's savvy dealing with the overseas publishers would ensure Carlyle received high compensation, which the novel did not attain in Britain.  The first British edition would be published in London in 1838."

        "content": "The novel takes the form of a long review by a somewhat cantankerous unnamed Editor for the English publication Fraser's Magazine (in which the novel was first serialised without any distinction of the content as fictional) who is, upon request, reviewing the fictional German book Clothes, Their Origin and Influence by the fictional philosopher Diogenes Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh (Professor of \"Things in General\" at Weissnichtwo \"Know not where\" University). The Editor is clearly flummoxed by the book, first struggling to explain the book in the context of contemporary social issues in England, some of which he knows Germany to be sharing as well, then conceding that he knows Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh personally, but that even this relationship does not explain the curiosities of the book's philosophy. The Editor remarks that he has sent requests back to Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's office in Germany for more biographical information hoping for further explanation, and the remainder of Book One contains summaries of Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's book, including translated quotations, accompanied by the Editor's many objections, many of them buttressed by quotations from Goethe and Shakespeare. The review becomes longer and longer due to the Editor's frustration at the philosophy, and his desire to expose its outrageous nature. At the final chapter of Book One, the Editor has received a reply from Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's office in the form of several bags of paper scraps (rather esoterically organised according to the  signs of the Latin Zodiac) on which are written autobiographical fragments.\nAt the writing of Book Two, the Editor has somewhat organised the fragments into a coherent narrative. As a boy, Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh was left in a basket on the doorstep of a childless couple in the German country town of Entepfuhl (\"Duck-Pond\"); his father a retired sergeant of Frederick the Great and his mother a very pious woman, who to Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's gratitude, raises him in utmost spiritual discipline. In very flowery language, Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh recalls at length the values instilled in his idyllic childhood, the Editor noting most of his descriptions originating in intense spiritual pride. Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh eventually is recognized as being clever, and sent to Hinterschlag (slap-behind) Gymnasium. While there, Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh is intellectually stimulated, and befriended by a few of his teachers, but frequently bullied by other students. His reflections on this time of his life are ambivalent: glad for his education, but critical of that education's disregard for actual human activity and character, as regarding both his own treatment and his education's application to politics. While at University, Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh encounters the same problems, but eventually gains a small teaching post and some favour and recognition from the German nobility. While interacting with these social circles, Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh meets a woman he calls Blumine (Goddess of Flowers; the Editor assumes this to be a pseudonym), and abandons his teaching post to pursue her. She spurns his advances for a British aristocrat named Towgood. Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh is thrust into a spiritual crisis, and leaves the city to wander the European countryside, but even there encounters Blumine and Towgood on their honeymoon. He sinks into a deep depression, culminating in the celebrated Everlasting No, disdaining all human activity. Still trying to piece together the fragments, the Editor surmises that Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh either fights in a war during this period, or at least intensely uses its imagery, which leads him to a \"Centre of Indifference\", and on reflection of all the ancient villages and forces of history around him, ultimately comes upon the affirmation of all life in \"The Everlasting Yea\". The Editor, in relief, promises to return to Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's book, hoping with the insights of his assembled biography to glean some new insight into the philosophy."

        "content": "Sartor Resartus was intended to be a new kind of book: simultaneously factual and fictional, serious and satirical, speculative and historical. It ironically commented on its own formal structure, while forcing the reader to confront the problem of where \"truth\" is to be found. In this respect it develops techniques used much earlier in Tristram Shandy, to which it refers. The imaginary \"Philosophy of Clothes\" holds that meaning is to be derived from phenomena, continually shifting over time, as cultures reconstruct themselves in changing fashions, power-structures, and faith-systems. The book contains a very Fichtean conception of religious conversion: based not on the acceptance of God but on the absolute freedom of the will to reject evil, and to construct meaning. This has led some writers to see Sartor Resartus as an early existentialist text.One of the recurring jokes is Carlyle giving humorously appropriate German names to places and people in the novel, such as Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's publisher being named Stillschweigen and Co. (meaning Silence and Company) and lodgings being in Weissnichtwo (meaning Know-not-where). Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's father is introduced as an earnest believer in Walter Shandy's doctrine that \"there is much, nay almost all in Names.\""

The most substantive early treatment came in the form of an 1835 letter to Carlyle from his friend John Sterling. Sterling compared it to Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Michel de Montaigne, Laurence Sterne and Jonathan Swift, while taking issue with Carlyle's style and what he perceived as Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's pantheism.Sartor Resartus was best received in America, where Carlyle became a dominant cultural influence and a perceived leader of the Transcendental Movement. In 1834, Harriet Martineau, visiting from England, observed its effect: \"The book is acting upon them with wonderful force. It has regenerated the preaching of more than one of the clergy; and, I have reason to believe, the minds and lives of several of the laity.\" After its 1836 arrival in Boston as a book, Nathaniel Langdon Frothingham accurately predicted that reaction would be divided between those that found it vapid and convoluted and those that found it insightful and philosophically fruitful. James Russell Lowell regarded the book as \"the signal for a sudden mental and moral mutiny\"."

There, they plan to intercept the arrival of the Pachacamac, a ship carrying their friend Professor Calculus, who is being held by kidnappers. Unfortunately, the ship has to be in quarantine for three weeks, due to reports of infectious disease on board. Suspecting the quarantine is staged, Tintin sneaks aboard the ship that night and learns from Chiquito, the former assistant of General Alcazar and one of the abductors, that Calculus is to be executed for wearing a bracelet belonging to the mummified Incan king Rascar Capac.\nTintin barely escapes the ship with his life, and he and Haddock alert the authorities; but the abductors evade the police and take Calculus to the Andes mountains. Tintin and Haddock pursue them to the mountain town of Jauga, where they board a train that is sabotaged in an attempt to kill them. When they attempt to investigate the whereabouts of Calculus, the local Indios prove to be peculiarly tight-lipped\u2014that is, until Tintin defends a young Quechua boy named Zorrino from being bullied by two Spaniard men. A mysterious man observes this act of kindness and gives Tintin a medallion, telling him that it will save him from danger. Zorrino informs Tintin that Calculus has been taken to the Temple of the Sun, which lies deep within the Andes, and offers to take them there.After many hardships \u2013 including being pursued by four Indios who try their best to leave them stranded or dead, and finding their way through the snowy mountains and the jungle beyond \u2013 Tintin, Haddock, and Zorrino reach the Temple of the Sun, a surviving outpost of the Inca civilisation. They are brought before the Prince of the Sun, flanked by Chiquito and Huascar, the mysterious man Tintin encountered in Jauga. Zorrino is saved from harm when Tintin gives him Huascar's medallion, but Tintin and Haddock are sentenced to death by the Inca prince for their sacrilegious intrusion. The prince tells them they may choose the hour that Pachacamac, the Sun god, will set alight the pyre on which they will be executed.Tintin and Haddock end up on the same pyre as Calculus. However, Tintin has chosen the hour of their death to coincide with a solar eclipse, and through play-acting he convinces the terrified Incas that he can command the Sun. The Inca prince implores Tintin to make the Sun show its light again. At Tintin's \"command\", the Sun returns, and the three are quickly set free. Afterwards, the Prince of the Sun tells them that the seven crystal balls used on the Sanders-Hardiman expedition members, who had excavated Rascar Capac's tomb, contained a \"mystic liquid\" obtained from coca that plunged them into a deep sleep. Each time the Inca high priest cast his spell over seven wax figures of the explorers, he could use them as he willed as punishment for their sacrilege. Tintin convinces the Inca prince that the explorers acted in good faith, as they only intended to make known to the world the splendours of the Inca civilisation. The Inca prince orders Chiquito to destroy the wax figures, and at that moment in Belgium, the seven explorers awaken in surprise. After swearing an oath to keep the temple's existence a secret, Tintin, Haddock and Calculus head home, while Zorrino remains with the Inca, having accepted an offer to live among them. Meanwhile, Thomson and Thompson's plan to find Tintin and his friends with Calculus' pendulum leads them on a wild goose chase around the world."

        "content": "Michael Farr described both The Seven Crystal Balls and Prisoners of the Sun as \"classic middle-period Tintin\", commenting on their \"surprisingly well-balanced narrative\" and the fact that they exhibited scant evidence of Herg\u00e9's turbulent personal life. He felt that the inclusion of paranormal elements to the story did nothing to make the narrative less convincing, and observes Herg\u00e9's recurring depiction of his character's disturbing dreams. Farr opined that the Inca costumes were drawn with \"a care and flamboyance that would do great credit to a major opera house production\", while the Andean landscapes were \"worthy of a Cecil B. DeMille film spectacular\". Herg\u00e9 biographer Beno\u00eet Peeters noted that Prisoner of the Sun was one of the Adventures to have \"most caught the imagination\", something that he attributed to its \"exceptional setting or the strength of the plot\".Harry Thompson noted that, like Red Rackham's Treasure, Prisoners of the Sun was \"an epic journey conditioned by the suspense of not knowing what will happen at the end\"; although he thought that, unlike Red Rackham's Treasure, it \"successfully transfers the fear of its unknown adversaries from the first part of the adventure into the second\". He also thought that, despite all the tribulations Herg\u00e9 faced while creating it, \"the pacing, the retention of suspense right to the end, and the fine balance of humour and drama\" do not betray the story's troubled development.Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier believed that the two-story arc represents \"one more leap forward in Herg\u00e9's graphic and narrative skills\" as a result of the transition to full colour double pages as the initial means of publication. They thought that this improvement was particularly evident in the scenes of the trek through the Andes in Prisoners of the Sun. They stated that with Prisoners of the Sun, the story had switched into \"Hitchcockian thriller mode\", a similar technique that Herg\u00e9 had adopted into a number of previous adventures. They described the character of Zorrino as \"basically a Peruvian version\" of Chang Chong-Chen, a character introduced to the series in The Blue Lotus. They described the story as \"a philosophical parable, perhaps a hidden reflection of Herg\u00e9's spiritual yearnings\"; in this way anticipating the themes that he would make use of in Tintin in Tibet. Ultimately, they awarded both halves of the story arc five out of five.\nLiterary critic Tom McCarthy identified elements within the story that he believed reflected recurring themes within The Adventures of Tintin. He thought that the appearance of Rascar Capac's jewels reflected Herg\u00e9's use of jewellery as a theme throughout the series, and that the scene in which Tintin commands the sun god to do his bidding reflects a wider theme throughout the series in which \"sacred authority\" manifests through voice. The scene in which Haddock causes an avalanche of snow by sneezing reflected what McCarthy considered a wider theme of the danger of sound, while Zorrino's decision to stay among the Inca was interpreted as a reflection of a wider theme of adoption. Commenting on the execution scene, McCarthy believed that it represented Haddock being \"sacrificed on the altar of his own illegitimacy\", a concept that he felt had been echoed throughout the series.In his psychoanalytical study of the Adventures of Tintin, the literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolid\u00e8s believed that The Seven Crystal Balls\u2013Prisoners of the Sun arc reflects a confrontation between civilisations, and between the sacred and the secular. He described the Quechuan society depicted by Herg\u00e9 as a \"totalitarian theocracy\", noting that the Tintin of Tintin in the Land of the Soviets and Tintin in the Congo would have approved of such a political system. He then drew comparisons between the Incan Prince of the Sun and the Syldavian King Muskar XII in King Ottokar's Sceptre, noting that in both the monarch is threatened by losing a treasured cultural artefact to foreigners. Apostolid\u00e8s also believed that the eclipse scene reflects a change in the power relations between the sacrificed (Tintin) and the sacrificer (the Inca prince). Commenting on Tintin's dream sequence in which he dreams of Calculus and Haddock, Apostolid\u00e8s believed that it reflected a \"latent homosexual desire\", comparing it with the dream sequence in The Crab with the Golden Claws."

Produced by Raymond Leblanc and directed by Eddie Lateste, it was written by Lateste, the cartoonist Greg, Jos Marissen, and Laszl\u00f3 Moln\u00e1r. Music was by Fran\u00e7ois Rauber and Zorrino's song was composed by Jacques Brel.In 1991, a second animated series based upon The Adventures of Tintin was produced, this time as a collaboration between the French studio Ellipse and the Canadian animation company Nelvana. Prisoners of the Sun was the twelfth story to be adapted and was divided into two thirty-minute episodes. Directed by St\u00e9phane Bernasconi, the series has been praised for being \"generally faithful\" to the original comics, to the extent that the animation was directly adopted from Herg\u00e9's original panels.In 1997, the French company Infogrames released a video game based on The Seven Crystal Balls-Prisoners of the Sun story arc, titled Prisoners of the Sun.In 2001, The Seven Crystal Balls and Prisoners of the Sun were adapted into a theatrical musical, Kuifje \u2013 De Zonnetempel (Tintin \u2013 The Temple of the Sun), which premiered in Dutch at the Stadsschouwburg in Antwerp, Belgium, on 15 September. Adapted for the stage by Seth Gaaikema and Frank Van Laecke, the production was directed by Dirk de Caluw\u00e9 and included music by Dirk Bross\u00e9, featuring Tom Van Landuyt in the role of Tintin. Didier Van Cauwelaert adapted the musical into French, and it then premiered a year later in Charleroi as Tintin \u2013 Le Temple du Soleil. From there, the production was scheduled for Paris in 2003 but was cancelled. It returned for a brief run in Antwerp on 18 October 2007.In 2018, it was reported that Prisoners of the Sun would be the basis for the sequel to 2011's The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn, which was directed by Steven Spielberg with Peter Jackson as executive producer. For the second film, Jackson and Spielberg would switch roles, with Jackson directing. Since then, however, apart from reassurances from both Spielberg and Jackson that the film would be forthcoming, there has been no news about its production."

Customers wearing long gowns were of the upper-class and sat down to drink, while those wearing short gowns were of the lower-class and were only able stand and drink outside.\nKong Yiji wore a long gown which was dirty and tattered. Although a member of the upper-class, Kong Yiji drank his wine standing, which contradicted with the social norms of the inn. In the beginning of the story, Kong Yiji is described as tall, with a pale complexion and a shaggy gray beard. He spoke sophisticatedly, and his speech was filled with literary jargon, which others were unable to completely understand. since his surname was Kong, people gave him a nickname mockingly from the copybooks for calligraphy called Kong Yiji.As a member of the upper-class, Kong Yiji studied Chinese classics, but due to low acceptance rates, failed to pass the academic examination, thus also failing to obtain an official post. As a result, he could not make a living, so he supported himself by begging, and using his calligraphy skills to copy books for others. However, he liked to drink and had a track record of being lazy.

When this happened, he would settle his debts within a month and have his name taken off the board.\nOne day, a few days before the Mid-Autumn Festival, the shopkeeper discovered that Kong Yiji had not come for a long time and owed 19 yuan. A customer stated that he stole other people's things and had his legs broken as a result. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, Kong Yiji reappeared at the Inn and ordered a bowl of warm wine. This time, \u201cHis face was haggard and lean, and he looked in a terrible condition. He had on a ragged lined jacket, and was sitting cross-legged on a mat which was attached to his shoulders by a straw rope.\u201d  Although he was not able to pay his debt, he paid for his wine that day, promising to pay off the rest later. Upon paying, the narrator notices that \u201chis hands were full of mud. It turned out that he had walked here with this hand. After a while, he finished drinking, sat down and walked slowly with this hand.\u201d  This was the last time the narrator saw Kong Yiji, who he eventually presumed to be dead as a result of his injuries."

        "content": "\"The Unreality of Time\" is the best-known philosophical work of the Cambridge idealist J. M. E. McTaggart (1866\u20131925). In the argument, first published as a journal article in Mind in 1908, McTaggart argues that time is unreal because our descriptions of time are either contradictory, circular, or insufficient. A slightly different version of the argument appeared in 1927 as one of the chapters in the second volume of McTaggart's greatest work, The Nature of Existence.The argument for the unreality of time is popularly treated as a stand-alone argument that does not depend on any significant metaphysical principles (e.g. as argued by C. D. Broad 1933 and L. O. Mink 1960). R. D. Ingthorsson disputes this, and argues that the argument can only be understood as an attempt to draw out certain consequences of the metaphysical system that McTaggart presents in the first volume of The Nature of Existence (Ingthorsson 1998 & 2016).\nIt is helpful to consider the argument as consisting of three parts. In the first part, McTaggart offers a phenomenological analysis of the appearance of time, in terms of the now famous A- and B-series (see below for detail). In the second part, he argues that a conception of time as only forming a B-series but not an A-series is an inadequate conception of time because the B-series does not contain any notion of change. The A-series, on the other hand, appears to contain change and is thus more likely to be an adequate conception of time. In the third and final part, he argues that the conception of time forming an A-series is contradictory and thus nothing can be like an A-series. Since the A- and the B- series exhaust possible conceptions of how reality can be temporal, and neither is adequate, the conclusion McTaggart reaches is that reality is not temporal at all."

        "content": "To frame his argument, McTaggart initially offers a phenomenological analysis of how time appears to us in experience. Time appears, he says, in the form of events standing in temporal positions, of which there are two kinds. On the one hand events are earlier than and later than each other, and on the other hand they are future, present, and past, and continually changing their position in terms of futurity, presentness, and pastness. The two kinds of temporal positions each represent events in time as standing in a certain order which McTaggart chooses to call the A-series and the B-series. The A-series represents the series of positions determined as future, present, and past, and which continuously pass from the distant future towards the present, and through the present into the remote past. The B-series represents the series of positions determined as earlier than or later than each other. The determinations of the B-series hold between the events in time, and never change. If an event ever is earlier or later than some other event, then their respective position in time never changes. The determinations of the A-series must hold to something outside of time, something that does not itself change its position in time, but in relation to which the events in time pass from being future, present, and past. Surprisingly, McTaggart does not suggest the present, or NOW, as this something whose position in time is fixed and unchanging. He just says that it will be difficult to identify any such entity (seeing as it is outside time). Broad explains that McTaggart believed that the difficulty of identifying this entity was serious enough in its own right to be persuaded that time is unreal, but thinks that the contradiction of the A-series is still more convincing; for that reason he leaves this particular difficulty aside."

        "content": "McTaggart argues that the conception of time as only forming a B-series is inadequate because the B-series does not change, and change is of the essence of time. If any conception of reality represents it as changeless, then this is a conception of an atemporal reality. The B-series does not change because earlier-later relationships never change (e.g. the year 2010 is always later than 2000). The events that form a B-series must therefore also form an A-series in order to count as being in time, i.e. they must pass from future to present, and from present to past, in order to change.\nThe A- and B-series are not mutually exclusive. If events form an A-series they automatically also form a B-series (anything in the present is earlier than anything in the future, and later than everything past). The question is not therefore whether time forms an A- or a B-series; the question is whether time forms both an A- and a B-series, or only a B-series.\nThe proponents of the B-view of time typically respond by arguing that even if events do not change their positions in the B-series, it does not follow that there can be no change in the B-series. This conclusion only follows if it is assumed that events are the only entities that can change. There can be change in the B-series in the form of objects bearing different properties at different times (Braithwaite 1928; Gotshalk 1930; Marhenke 1935; Smart 1949; Mellor 1981 & 98; Oaklander 1984; LePoidevin 1991; Dyke 2002).The suggestion that the B-view of time can escape the problem by appealing to particulars that endure through time and have different properties at different times is controversial in its own right, but it is generally assumed that this is a controversy that has nothing to do with McTaggart. Instead it is treated as a separate issue, the question of whether things can endure in B-time. However, as Ingthorsson has argued, McTaggart does discuss variation in the properties of persistent entities in the 1st Volume of The Nature of Existence, and there comes to the conclusion that variation in the properties of things between times is not change but mere variation between the temporal parts of things (Ingthorsson 2001)."

        "content": "Attacking the A-series, McTaggart argues that any event in the A-series is past, present, and future, which is contradictory in that each of those properties excludes the other two. McTaggart admits that the contradictory nature of the A-series may not be obvious, because it would appear that events never are simultaneously future, present, and past, but only successively so. However, there is a contradiction, he insists, because any attempt to explain why they are future, present, and past, at different times is (i) circular because we would need to describe the successive order of those \"different times\" again by invoking the determinations of being future, present or past, and (ii) this in turn will inevitably lead to a vicious infinite regress. The vicious infinite regress arises, because to explain why the second appeal to future, present, and past, doesn't lead again to the same difficulty all over, we need to explain that they in turn apply successively and thus we must again explain that succession by appeal to future, present, and past, and there is no end to such an explanation. It is the validity of the argument in favour of a vicious infinite regress that has received the most attention in 20th Century philosophy of time.\nIn the later version of the argument, in The Nature of Existence, McTaggart no longer advances the circularity objection. This is, arguably, because by then he has come to treat tense as a simple and indefinable notion, and thus cannot contend that the terms need to be explained at all in order to be applied. He now instead argues that even if it is admitted that they are simple and indefinable, and thus can be applied without further analysis, they still lead to contradiction.\nPhilosophers who favour the B-view of time tend to find McTaggart's argument against the A-series to demonstrate conclusively that tense involves a contradiction. On the other hand, philosophers who favour the A-view of time struggle to see why the argument should be considered to have any force. Two of the most commonly invoked objections are, first, that McTaggart is mistaken about the phenomenology of time; that he is claiming to see a contradiction in the appearance of time, where none is apparent. Second, that McTaggart is mistaken about the semantics of tensed discourse. The idea here is that claims like \"M is present, has been future, and will be past\" can only imply a contradiction if it is interpreted as saying that M is all at once future in the past, present in the present, and also past in the future. This reading, it is argued, is absurd because \"has been\" and \"will be\" indicate that we are not talking about how M currently is, but instead of how M once was, but is no longer, and how it will be, but is not yet. Hence it is wrong to think of the expression as an attribution to M of futurity, presentness, and pastness, all at once (Marhenke 1935; Broad 1938; Mink 1960; Prior 1967; Christensen 1974; Lloyd 1977; Lowe 1987).\n\nIngthorsson has argued that the reason for this incommensurability between the proponents of the A- and B-views is found in the prevailing view that McTaggart's argument is a stand-alone argument. If it is read in that way, the proponents of each view will understand the argument against the background of their respective views of time, and come to incompatible conclusions (1998 & 2016). Indeed, on closer scrutiny it will be found that McTaggart explicitly claims that in \"The Unreality of Time\" he is inquiring whether reality can have the characteristics it appears to have in experience (notably being temporal and material) given his earlier conclusions about what reality must really be like in Absolute Reality. In the introduction to the 2nd Volume of The Nature of Existence, he says: Starting from our conclusions as to the general nature of the existent, as reached in the earlier Books, we shall have to ask, firstly which of these characteristics can really be possessed by what is existent, and which of them, in spite of the prim\u00e2 facie appearance to the contrary, cannot be possessed by anything existent (1927: sect. 295).And he continues:It will be possible to show that, having regard to the general nature of the existent as previously determined, certain characteristics, that we consider here for the first time, cannot be true of the existent (1927: sect. 298).As Ingthorsson notes, the most central result of McTaggart's earlier inquiry into the general nature of the existent in Absolute Reality, an inquiry McTaggart claims is based entirely on a priori arguments (i.e. such as do not rely on any empirical observations), is that existence and reality coincide and have no degrees: either something exists and thus is real, or it does not. It immediately follows that for the future and past to be real, they must exist. This is why he interprets the statement \"M is present, has been future, and will be past\" as a statement about M existing in the present bearing the property of being present, and existing in the past bearing the property of being future, and existing in the future bearing the property of being past. This interpretation of the expression, if correct, does say that M is future, present, and past, which is contradictory. However, since it starts from the premise that the future and past can only be real by existing, then it remains to show that this is what the A-view of time assumes."

        "content": "Having come to the conclusion that reality can neither form an A- nor a B-series, despite appearances to the contrary, then McTaggart finds it necessary to explain what the world is really like such that it appears to be different from what it appears to be. Here is where the C-series comes into play. McTaggart does not say much about the C-series in the original journal article, but in The Nature of Existence he devotes six whole chapters to discuss it (1927: Chs. 44\u20139).\nThe C-series is rarely given much attention. When it is mentioned, it is described as \"an expression synonymous with 'B-series' when the latter is shorn of its temporal connotations\" (Shorter 1986: 226). There is a grain of truth in this, but there is more to the C-series than this. Stripping the temporal features from the B-series only gives what the C- and B-series have minimally in common, notably the constituents of the series and the formal characteristics of being linear, asymmetric, and transitive. However, the C-series has features that the B-series does not have. The constituents of the C-series are mental states (a consequence of McTaggart's argument in Ch. 34 of The Nature of Existence that reality cannot really be material), which are related to each other on the basis of their conceptual content in terms of being included in and inclusive of (1927: sect. 566 & Ch. 60). These atemporal relations are meant to provide what the earlier/later than relation cannot, notably explain why an illusion of change and temporal succession can arise in an atemporal reality."

        "content": "McTaggart's argument has had an enormous influence on the philosophy of time. His phenomenological analysis of the appearance of time has been accepted as good and true even by those who firmly deny the end conclusion that time is unreal. For instance, J. S. Findlay (1940) and A. Prior (1967) took McTaggart's phenomenological analysis as their point of departure in the development of modern tense logic.\nMcTaggart's characterisation of the appearance of time in terms of the A- and B-series served to sharpen the contrast between the two emerging and rival views of time that we now know as the A- and B-views of time. The assumption is that the A-view, in accepting the reality of tense, represent time as being like an A-series, and that the B-view, in rejecting the reality of tense, represent time as being like a B-series.\nThe two objections that McTaggart develops against the conception of time as forming an A- and a B-series are still the two main objections with which the A- and B-views of time struggle. Notably, is the A-view contradictory, and is the B-view able to incorporate an account of change?\nThe controversy about McTaggart's argument for the unreality of time continues unabated (see, for instance, Smith 2011; Cameron 2015; Mozersky 2015; Ingthorsson 2016)."

That, and the fact that the body had been buried several centuries before, drives them to travel such long distances to reach the site. Upon reaching the old cemetery, they notice the distant baying of a giant hound. They ignore it and begin their excavation. After some time, they hit a solid object in the ground. Clearing the last of the dirt from it, the two men unearth a strange and elaborately-made casket. Upon opening the casket, they see that several places on the skeletal remains appear torn and shattered, as if attacked by a wild animal, yet the whole of the skeleton is still completely distinguishable. At that moment, they notice a jade amulet hanging from the skeleton's neck. They examine it and, after some observation, they recognize the amulet as one mentioned in \"the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred.\" They immediately know they must have the amulet at all costs. They remove it from the skeleton and flee into the night. As they do, they notice once again the continuous sound of a baying hound in the distance.\nAfter they return home to England, strange events begin to occur. Odd sounds can be heard within and around their house, including the distant howling they heard in the cemetery. One night, St. John is violently attacked and killed by a mysterious creature, which the narrator claims the amulet had brought unto him. He destroys the macabre museum he and his friend made before fleeing from the house and traveling to London. Still plagued by bizarre occurrences, he decides that he must return the amulet to its rightful owner. He travels to Holland, but the amulet is stolen from him before he can return it. The next day, he reads in the newspaper about a band of thieves savagely killed by an unknown creature. Slowly going insane, he returns to the churchyard and exhumes the coffin once more, only to find the skeleton within covered in caked blood and bits of flesh and hair, holding the lost amulet in its hand. Suddenly, the skeleton begins howling, the same howl that had tormented him since he first stole the amulet. The narrator flees the graveyard, succumbing to madness and despair. He states that he intends to kill himself with a revolver, believing death to be his only refuge from the crawling horror which grows within him."

        "content": "\"The Hound\" contains several references to the body of lore known as the Cthulhu Mythos that Lovecraft shared with other horror writers. Most notably, it marks the first appearance of one of Lovecraft's most famous literary creations\u2014the forbidden book known as the Necronomicon. Lovecraft had mentioned its author a year earlier, in \"The Nameless City\", but here for the first time named the book. Referring to an amulet found on a grave-robbing expedition, the narrator relates:\n\nAlien it indeed was to all art and literature which sane and balanced readers know, but we recognized it as the thing hinted of in the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred; the ghastly soul-symbol of the corpse-eating cult of inaccessible Leng, in Central Asia. All too well did we trace the sinister lineaments described by the old Arab daemonologist; lineaments, he wrote, drawn from some obscure supernatural manifestation of the souls of those who vexed and gnawed at the dead.The reference to \"Leng\" is one of the first mentions of Lovecraft's imaginary plateau, having only appeared before in 1920s \"Celephais\". Here placed in Central Asia, Leng is also associated in Lovecraft's writings with Antarctica and his imaginary Dreamlands.\nLovecraftian scholar Will Murray, pointing to the \"semi-canine face\" on the amulet as well as the \"corpse-eating cult\" of Leng, suggests that the titular creature of \"The Hound\" \"probably represents an early form of the ghoul as Lovecraft would develop it.\""

        "content": "On September 16, 1922, Lovecraft toured the Flatbush Reformed Church in Brooklyn with his friend Rheinhart Kleiner, writing about the visit in a letter:\n\nAround the old pile is a hoary churchyard, with internments [sic?] dating from around 1730 to the middle of the nineteenth century.... From one of the crumbling gravestones--dated 1747--I chipped a small piece to carry away. It lies before me as I write--and ought to suggest some sort of horror-story. I must place it beneath my pillow as I sleep... who can say what thing might not come out of the centuried earth to exact vengeance for his desecrated tomb? And should it come, who can say what it might not resemble?Lovecraft wrote \"The Hound\" shortly afterwards, using as the name of one of the main characters his nickname for his companion Kleinhart, \"St. John\". The grave that is fatefully robbed in the story is in a \"terrible Holland churchyard\"\u2014perhaps a reference to Flatbush church being part of the Dutch Reformed Church (although the story is actually set in the Netherlands, as well as in England).\nCritic Steven J. Mariconda suggests that the story is a tribute to the Decadent literary movement in general and in particular Joris-Karl Huysmans' A rebours, an 1884 novel that Lovecraft greatly admired. (Huysmans is mentioned by name in the story, along with Baudelaire.) Like \"The Hound\"'s protagonists, victims of a \"devastating ennui\", the main character of A rebours suffers from an \"overpowering tedium\" that leads him to \"imagine and then indulge in unnatural love-affairs and perverse pleasures.\" Mariconda also points to the heavy debt the story owes to  Edgar Allan Poe, an influence acknowledged by several borrowed phrases:\n\nThe \"oblong box\" exumed, the mysterious \"knock on my chamber door\", and the \"red death\" brought by the Hound all echo Poe's phraseology."

But the story has its defenders; Steven J. Mariconda says it is \"written in a zestful, almost baroque style which is very entertaining\", while Peter Cannon, saying that it must have been written \"with tongue at least partly in cheek\", credits it with a certain \"naive charm\".The plot of the Poppy Z.

Dick volunteers to help and quickly realizes that his brother would see the Pits as an excellent place to play hide-and-seek.

Margot finds Robert witty and funny through text, and their conversations grow frequent, including running jokes about Robert's two pet cats, but he is more awkward and inscrutable when she tries to see him in person.\nWhen Margot returns from visiting home for winter break, she and Robert go on a real date: they see a movie, go to a bar (during which Robert learns her age), and then return to Robert's home. Despite being disappointed and uncomfortable during the date, Margot consents to sex with Robert rather than navigate turning him down. After the distasteful sex encounter, which largely disgusts her, Margot learns that Robert is thirty-four years old and reflects that their conversations have been impersonal. After not seeing Robert's cats in his home, she wonders if their existence and other aspects of Robert's persona while texting were fabricated.\nMargot resolves to tell Robert she is not interested in continuing to see him but ignores his messages while she is unsure of how to do it politely but firmly. Her roommate eventually impersonates her in the break-up text. A month later, she sees Robert while out at a bar with her friends; she is unsettled by the idea that he is looking for her and avoids him. That night, he texts her repeatedly, his messages at first insecure and politely questioning if she was with a new boyfriend but becoming more needy, jealous and belligerent as Margot does not reply, ending with calling her \"Whore.\""

The third reviewer, Jacob Hope Chapman, heavily criticized the show's cheap production for its workmanlike animation clashing with the shoddy CG backgrounds and felt the humor was undone by poor direction and writing. He concluded that there's similar anime with better writing and aesthetics compared to this, saying that, \"There's just not anything unique or intriguing about this one.\" Fellow ANN editor Paul Jensen reviewed the complete anime series in 2016. He commended the spiritual humor, the different interactions both Narumi and Hibiki have with the ghosts, and the moments of sweetness and melancholia throughout the various episodic storylines but was critical of the series overall not pushing forward its brand of comedy and drama beyond mildly entertaining and lacked the \"sense of wonder or magic\" humans have when interacting with spirits in their world compared to similar otherworldly series like Mushi-Shi and Flying Witch, concluding that \"On the whole Re-Kan! is an enjoyable show that's worth a look if you've got a taste for lighthearted comedy or the slice of life genre in general.\""

It depicts the alcohol-dominated lives of two forlorn bakers who attempt to run a small bakery. The strip was adapted into a video-art installation piece by the artist Mark Leckey in 2006, and a novel 'Drunken Baker' by Barney Farmer in 2018.\nThe strip has been compared to the work of Samuel Beckett. Its nihilistic aspects have impressed critics. Roberta Smith, in The New York Times said \"The aesthetic compression of Mr Farmer's dialogue and Mr Healey's line...convey an oppressive sense of the drinker's irresistible drive for oblivion.\""

        "content": "The two bakers attempt to run a bakery together. Their names have never been mentioned; one has sparse black hair, the other has a bulbous nose and large phiz of white hair (in flashbacks he is shown to have had dark hair when younger), bearing a passing resemblance to Harpo Marx. They are drawn as - and have the personalities of - a pair of classic clown archetypes, an odd couple: the curly haired but balding one being short and aggressive, the taller being doleful. In one episode, a funeral, they were drawn as wearing suits that were for the curly-haired one much too small, and for the taller one much too big - another classic clown type. According to Roberta Smith, the characters are \"two middle-aged Bumstead-like alcoholics haplessly lurching from one disaster and one drink to the next as they attempt to run a bakery.\"Both bakers suffer from severe alcoholism, and every strip shows them drinking strong alcoholic beverages such as various liqueurs. Their idea of a Wednesday half-closing is to sit on a public seat in front of a local off-licence, enjoying the 'view'. The black-haired one has an estranged daughter as his wife left him on a Christmas Eve.  Occasionally the curly haired one will remind him of this, usually due to the black haired one offending the curly haired one. They try their best to bake something every night, but because of their inebriation, the results are always hopeless. As critic Steve Lowe says,\n\nBefore long, they're both staggering round a smoke-filled bakery surrounded by empty spirits bottles. Again. It's tricky to say what's so appealing about their slide from being worthy citizens to utterly wrecked lost souls. Writer Barney Farmer and artist Lee Healey imbue the strips with a real sense of despondency; these aren't drunks who have convivial escapades or adventures - they are drunks who drink, get drunk, pass out and burn the cakes. And being bakers somehow makes it worse: it seems such a wholesome occupation.\nTheir shop is run down, and has few customers; the pair sometimes look back to more prosperous, happier times, but are always brought back to their dismal present-day reality. If they even manage to bake something, it is often inedible, sometimes even toxic. For instance in one episode they baked cakes made with paraffin instead of milk - \"This milk is blue and it tastes funny\". The only exception to this is the 25th anniversary of the opening of the bakery, when the black-haired one decides to bake twin cakes in the form of the number 25. He succeeds, producing the number 25 in cake form, while his partner drinks mulled wine made in the kettle, which has held something nasty. In the final frame the inevitable happens - the fellow vomits up his stomach contents all over the anniversary cakes, and so their only success is utterly ruined.\nCustomers sometimes arrive at the baker's shop, asking for various breads or pastries, at Christmas, a whole lot of Christmas cakes, and once even a five-tiered wedding cake. The bakers promise they'll bake it for them, but always fail to fulfil their promise. Recent strips have featured one of the protagonists being hospitalised with renal failure while the other drinks rum at his bedside. Their shop, which is almost perpetually empty of produce, especially the front window, has been vandalized many times, and has burnt down several times, generally due to them leaving the oven on and falling into a drunken stupor.\nThe strip is fatalistic; the bakers will never reform, their customers will never get proper service, and nobody is doing a thing about it. Nevertheless, they carry on. As art critic Emily Mears remarks, \"somehow, with the remarkable fortitude of true career drunks and in a rather sweet depiction of brotherly love, they prop each other up and return, strip after strip, to bake again.\" Some storylines fail to resolve themselves and end indeterminately, reinforcing the character's cyclical and depressing existence. In one strip, one of the bakers is bitten by a stray dog he has befriended, but he doesn't notice. \"Your mouth is pissing blood\" remarks the other baker in the final frame.\nWhereas most of the comics in Viz have traditional hand-lettered captions and dialogue, the Drunken Bakers strip instalments (and other, less regular strips by Farmer and Healey) have typeset speech balloons. This gives Farmer and Healey's work a significantly different appearance from other Viz material."

Leckey created a film using frames from the original strips to construct a narrative and added a soundtrack spoken by himself and his colleague Steve Claydon in Liverpudlian accents. According to Emily Mears,\n\nBy fading the screen to black between episodes, Leckey constructs an elliptical narrative that mirrors the sense of time lost by the drinkers and the viewer. The video plays in a white box with a white carpet; a clock projected onto the outside of the box tells a stuck time, the hour hand slipping back to three each time it manages to reach four.\nIn Roberta Smith's words, Leckey constructs \"dreamy, druggy, disjointed variants on music videos...He has ingeniously filmed the comic strip with close-ups and jump-cuts, creating a kind of stop-action animation, and added a skillfully explicit soundtrack replete with convincing belches, slurps, breaking glass and vomiting.\" Smith says that Leckey's artwork is less an original work than an \"adaptation or an homage\" of the original cartoon.Lecky also created models of the bakers, exhibited as Drunken Bakers Dozen in 2007."

        "content": "The text begins immediately with dialogue between James and Jesus. Jesus refers to himself as an image of God and explains that everything came from Him-who-is. He also speaks of femaleness and how it prepared for itself powers and gods, but it did not exist when he came forth. Jesus predicts that he will be seized the day after tomorrow, but his redemption will be near. He tells James to leave Jerusalem because it is a dwelling place of a great number of archons, and his redemption will be preserved from them. Jesus then explains the nature of the archons and the 72 heavens, which are their subordinates. He explains that Him-who-is has been given on account of them, and they are unnumbered. Jesus tells James that he will no longer be James but the One-who-is, and all those who are unnumbered will have been named when he casts away from his blind thought the bond of flesh that encircles him.\nJames asks Jesus how he can reach Him-who-is, given that the powers and hosts of the archons are armed against him. Jesus tells James that the powers are not armed against James specifically but against Jesus himself. Jesus expresses his concern for James, who has descended into great ignorance but has not been defiled by it, unlike those who have succumbed to it. Jesus acknowledges that he is not like them, but he has clothed himself with everything of theirs. James and Jesus discuss their respective states of mind and being, with Jesus acknowledging his faintheartedness before the anger of the archons. The text emphasizes the importance of knowledge and recollection in the pursuit of spiritual understanding and the attainment of salvation.\nJames expresses his fear of the powers that rule the world. Jesus reassures James that he will reveal to him his redemption and everything else, not only for James but for the sake of the faith of many people. After Jesus departs to be crucified, James suffers and is distressed until Jesus reappears to him and explains that he has not suffered and that the people have done him no harm. Jesus explains that the people exist as a type of the archons and that they deserve to be destroyed through them. Jesus warns James that he (Jesus) has stirred up great anger and wrath against himself but that it is necessary for the sake of others.\nJesus tells James that he will undergo suffering but encourages him to not be afraid. Jesus reveals to James that he (James) will be seized and face three toll collectors who take away souls by theft. Jesus instructs James to respond to their questioning by declaring himself a son of the Pre-existent Father and from the Pre-existent One. James should also acknowledge that the alien things they ask about are not entirely alien but are from Achamoth, who is the female and mistress of those things. Jesus explains that Sophia is the mother of Achamoth and the source of the imperishable knowledge that will redeem James. Jesus identifies himself and all the sons of the Pre-existent One as known by the disciples and hidden within them. Jesus instructs James to hide these things within himself and to reveal them to Addai, who will write them down and eventually pass them to Levi and his two sons.\nJames is reassured by Jesus that his soul will return to the Father after he is attacked by the archons. He asks about the seven women who were Jesus's disciples. Jesus discusses the spirits of thought, counsel, knowledge, and fear, and recalls a confrontation with the archon Adonaios. Jesus encourages James to cast away bitterness and lawlessness, and to beware of those who envy him. Jesus tells James to encourage Salome, Mariam, Martha, and Arsinoe. At the end of the text, James rebukes the archons before unknown speakers argue over the apparent martyrdom of James.\n\n\n== References =="

The musician tells the wolf to do everything he says and he takes him to an old oak tree, which is hollow inside and split open in the middle. The wolf has to put his front paws in the slit, the musician grabs a stone and fixes the wolf's paws. The musician goes on and plays another tune, then a fox comes.\nThe musician was not waiting for the fox either, but the fox also wants to learn to play the violin. The fox, too, must do everything the musician tells him to do, and they set off together. They come to a path with tall bushes on either side, where the musician bends down a hazel tree and puts his foot on the top. He does the same with a small tree on the other side of the path, and he ties the left front leg to the left trunk. The right front leg is tied to the right trunk, and then he releases the tree limbs. The fox flies into the air, where it remains floating, and the musician continues on the path. After a while, he plays his fiddle again, and then a hare comes.\nThe musician was not waiting for the hare either, the hare also wants to learn how to play the violin. The musician also tells the hare to do everything he is told and they set off together like an apprentice with his master. At a clearing in the woods, the musician ties a long rope around the hare's neck and ties the other end to a tree. The hare must run around the tree twenty times, after which the hare is trapped. The wolf, meanwhile, has freed himself and runs furiously after the musician. The fox sees him and shouts that the musician has tricked him, whereupon the wolf pulls down the tree limbs and bites the ropes. Together they set out to take revenge, finding the tied hare and freeing him as well.\nMeanwhile, the musician made music again, and this time a woodsman came. Whether he wanted to or not, he had to stop his work and comes to the musician with his axe. The musician is happy to finally see a human being instead of a wild animal, and as he plays for the woodcutter, the three animals come running. The woodcutter stands in front of the musician with his axe and says that they will have to deal with him if they want to do anything to the musician. The animals get scared and run into the forest, after which the musician plays another tune for the woodcutter as thanks for his help."

        "content": "The \"X Article\" is an article, formally titled \"The Sources of Soviet Conduct\", written by George F. Kennan and published under the pseudonym \"X\" in the July 1947 issue of Foreign Affairs magazine. It widely introduced the term \"containment\" and advocated for its strategic use against the Soviet Union. It expanded on ideas expressed by Kennan in a confidential February 1946 telegram, formally identified by Kennan's State Department number, \"511\", but informally dubbed the \"long telegram\" for its size.\nKennan composed the long telegram to respond to inquiries about the implications of a February 1946 speech by Joseph Stalin. Though the speech was in line with previous statements by Stalin, it provoked fear in the American press and public; Time magazine called it \"the most warlike pronouncement uttered by any top-rank statesman since V-J Day\". The long telegram explained Soviet motivations by recounting the history of Russian rulers as well as the ideology of Marxism\u2013Leninism. It argued that the Soviet leaders used the ideology to characterize the external world as hostile, allowing them to justify their continued hold on power despite a lack of popular support. Washington bureaucrats quickly read the confidential message and accepted it as the best explanation of Soviet behavior. The reception elevated Kennan's reputation within the State Department as one of the government's foremost Soviet experts.\nAfter hearing Kennan speak about Soviet foreign relations at the Council on Foreign Relations in January 1947, international banker R. Gordon Wasson suggested that he share his views in an article for Foreign Affairs. Kennan revised a piece he had submitted to Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal in late-January 1947, but his role in government precluded him from publishing under his name. His superiors granted him approval to publish the piece provided it was released anonymously; Foreign Affairs attributed the article only to \"X\". Expressing similar sentiments to that of the long telegram, the piece was strong in its anti-communism, introducing and outlining a basic theory of containment.  The article was widely read; though it does not mention the Truman Doctrine, having mostly been written before Truman's speech, it quickly became seen as an expression of the doctrine's policy. Retrospective commentators dispute the impact of the article; Henry Kissinger referred to it as \"the diplomatic doctrine of the era\", while some historians write that its impact in shaping governmental policy has been overstated."

The speech did not discuss foreign policy, but instead made pledges to expand industry. He justified the expansion by pointing to Marxist\u2013Leninist theory, warning that capitalism possessed a predisposition towards conflict.Stalin's speech provoked fear in the American press and public, with Time magazine calling it \"the most warlike pronouncement uttered by any top-rank statesman since V-J Day.\" George F. Kennan, then working for the US State Department as charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Moscow, found the speech routine and reflective of previous statements from Stalin. With this in mind, he issued only a quick summary of the speech for the State Department. Despite the familiar statements from Stalin, the context in which they were made \u2013 including the Soviet Union's recent rejection of Bretton Woods and evidence of atomic espionage in the United States and Canada \u2013 alarmed officials in Washington. In a 1982 interview, former diplomat Elbridge Durbrow expressed that Stalin's speech had in effect said, \"to hell with the rest of the world.\" US President Harry Truman was confused by the Soviet's policies, at times appearing belligerent and at others exercising self-restraint. Leaders were increasingly coming to the conclusion that the existing quid pro quo strategy was ineffective against the Soviets, but had no replacement strategy.Durbrow and another diplomat, H. Freeman Matthews \u2013 both readers of Kennan's earlier telegrams \u2013 were confused by Kennan's relative silence about the speech. On 13 February, Matthews drafted a message, signed by Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, asking for an analysis. The message described the press and public's reaction having been, \"to a degree not hitherto felt\", and expressed: \"We should welcome receiving from you an interpretive analysis of what we may expect in the way of future implementation of these announced policies.\" W. Averell Harriman, having recently returned from his ambassadorship to the Soviet Union, spoke to Kennan and encouraged him to write a thorough analysis."

        "content": "Kennan probably wrote rough drafts of a message before dictating a final version to his secretary, Dorothy Hessman, on February 22, 1946. Finishing late at night, he took the message to the Mokhovaya code room in Moscow and had it telegraphed back to Washington. The message was quickly dubbed the \"long telegram\" because, at a little over 5,000 words, it was the longest telegram sent in the history of the State Department.Identified as \"511\" by Kennan's State Department number, the message is divided into five sections, covering the Soviet Union's background, current features, future prospects and the implications these would have for the United States. It opens with an apology for its length but qualifies the necessity of responding to all the then pressing concerns at once. Kennan begins by laying out the world from the Soviet perspective, splitting it into socialist and capitalist sectors. The alliance between the United States and Great Britain was destined to fail, and would either lead to war between them or a joint attack on the Soviet Union. The Soviets believed they would ultimately prevail in such a conflict, but would need to grow their strength and exploit the capitalists' tendency towards conflict amongst one another in the meantime. Kennan described these ideas as absurd, pointing out that capitalist countries were not failing and were not always in conflict. Further, he described the idea that the United States and Great Britain would deliberately enter into a war against the Soviets as the \"sheerest nonsense\".\n\nThe Soviet leaders reached these illogical sentiments, he explained, because  \"... at the bottom of the Kremlin's view of world affairs is a traditional and instinctive Russian sense of insecurity.\" The authority of previous Russian rulers was \"archaic in form, fragile and artificial in its psychological foundation, unable to stand comparison or contact with political systems of western countries.\" This understanding of Russian history was joined with the ideology of Marxism-Leninism. Their obstinacy in dealing with the West was born out of necessity; seeing the rest of the world as hostile provided an excuse \"for the dictatorship without which they did not know how to rule, for cruelties they did not dare not to inflict, for sacrifices they felt bound to demand.\" Until the Soviet Union either experienced consistent failures or their leader was persuaded that they were negatively affecting their nation's interest, the West could not expect any reciprocity from the Soviets.The Soviet government, Kennan continued, could be understood as occupying two distinct spaces: an official, visible government and another operating without any official acknowledgement. While the former would participate in international diplomacy, the latter would attempt to undermine the capitalist nations as much as possible, including efforts to \"disrupt national self confidence, to hamstring measures of national defense, to increase social and industrial unrest, to stimulate all forms of disunity.\" He opined that the Soviets ultimately have no expectation of reconciliation with the West.Kennan concluded not by offering specific courses of action, but instead offered more general solutions, such as the necessity of maintaining courage and self-confidence in interactions with the Soviets. Managing the threat would require \"the same thoroughness and care as solution of major strategic problem in war, and if necessary, with no smaller outlay in planning effort.\" He wrote that, compared to Nazi Germany, the Soviets are much more patient and often risk averse. Being weaker than the West, not having regular procedures for replacing leaders, having absorbed too many territories, failing to inspire its people and being overly reliant on negative propaganda meant \"we may approach calmly and with good heart [the] problem of how to deal with Russia.\"Kennan emphasized the need of educating the American public about the threat of international communism. Keeping Western society strong was important to ward off the expansive tendencies of communism: \"The greatest danger that can befall us in coping with this problem of Soviet communism, is that we shall allow ourselves to become like those with whom we are coping.\""

Jesus shares the parable with his disciples, the Pharisees, and others.\nIn the story, a father has two sons. The younger son asks for his portion of inheritance from his father, who grants his son's request. This son, however, is prodigal (i.e., wasteful and extravagant), thus squandering his fortune and eventually becoming destitute. As consequence, he now must return home empty-handed and intend to beg his father to accept him back as a servant. To the son's surprise, he is not scorned by his father but is welcomed back with celebration and a welcoming party. Envious, the older son refuses to participate in the festivities. The father tells the older son: \"you are ever with me, and all that I have is yours, but your younger brother was lost and now he is found.\"\nThe Prodigal Son is the third and final parable of a cycle on redemption, following the parable of the Lost Sheep and the parable of the Lost Coin. In Revised Common Lectionary and Roman Rite Catholic Lectionary, this parable is read on the fourth Sunday of Lent (in Year C); in the latter it is also included in the long form of the Gospel on the 24th Sunday of Ordinary Time in Year C, along with the preceding two parables of the cycle. In the Eastern Orthodox Church it is read on the Sunday of the Prodigal Son."

        "content": "The parable begins with a man who had two sons, and the younger of them asks his father to give him his share of the estate. The implication is the son could not wait for his father's death for his inheritance, he wanted it immediately. The father agrees and divides his estate between both sons.\nUpon receiving his portion of the inheritance, the younger son travels to a distant country, where he indulges in extravagant living. It is implied that he drinks, gambles, and sleeps with prostitutes during this time. However, it is not long before he has exhausted all his money, and immediately thereafter, a permanent famine strikes the land. This leaves him desperately poor, as the possessions he'd bought were sold to pay his debts. He is forced to take work as a swineherd (which would have been abhorrent to Jesus' Jewish audience, who considered swine unclean animals) where he reaches the point of envying the food of the pigs he is tending to. At this time, he finally comes to his senses:\nAnd when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.\nAnd he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.\nThis implies the father was watching hopefully for the son's return.\nThe son starts his rehearsed speech, admitting his sins, and declaring himself unworthy of being his father's son, but in most versions of Luke, the son does not even finish, before his father accepts him back wholeheartedly without hesitation as the father calls for his servants to dress the son in the finest robe available, get a ring for his finger, and sandals for his feet, and to slaughter the \"fatted calf\" for a celebratory meal (dinner party).\nThe older son, who was at work in the fields, hears the sound of celebration, and is told by a fellow servant about the return of his younger brother. He is not impressed, and becomes angry. He also has a speech for his father:\nAnd he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: but as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.\nThe parable concludes with the father explaining that while the older son has always been present, and everything the father owns also belongs to the older son, because the younger son had returned, in a sense, from the dead, celebration was necessary:\nIt was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found."

        "content": "The opening, \"A man had two sons\" is a storyteller's trope and would immediately bring to mind Cain and Abel, Ishmael and Isaac, and Jacob and Esau. Jesus then confounds the listeners' expectations when the younger son is shown to be foolish.While a number of commentators see the request of the younger son for his share of the inheritance as \"brash, even insolent\" and \"tantamount to wishing that the father was dead,\" Jewish legal scholar Bernard Jackson says \"Jewish sources give no support to [the idea] that the prodigal, in seeking the advance, wishes his father dead.\"The young man's actions do not lead to success; he squanders his inheritance and he eventually becomes an indentured servant, with the degrading job of looking after pigs, and even envying them for the carob pods they eat. This recalls Proverbs 29:3: \"Whoever loves wisdom gives joy to his father, but whoever consorts with harlots squanders his wealth.\"Upon his return, his father treats the young man with a generosity far more than he has a right to expect. He is given the best robe, a ring for his finger, and sandals for his feet. Jewish philosopher Philo observes:\nParents often do not lose thought for their wastrel (asoton) children [...] In the same way, God too [...] takes thought also for those who live a misspent life, thereby giving them time for reformation, and also keeping within the bounds His own merciful nature.\nThe Pesikta Rabbati has a similar story:\nA king had a son who had gone astray from his father on a journey of a hundred days. His friends said to him, 'Return to your father.' He said, 'I cannot.' Then his father sent word, 'Return as far as you can, and I will come the rest of the way to you.' So God says, 'Return to me, and I will return to you.'\nThe older son, in contrast, seems to think in terms of \"law, merit, and reward,\" rather than \"love and graciousness.\" He may represent the Pharisees who were criticizing Jesus.Leviticus Rabbah 13:4 also contains a short saying that matches the character of the parable:\nR. Aha has said: When a Jew has to resort to carobs, he repents.\nThe last few verses of the parable summarize the tale in accordance with the Jewish teaching of the two ways of acting: the way of life (obedience) and the way of death (sin). God, according to Judaism, rejoices over and grants more graces to repentant sinners than righteous souls who do not need repentance.Following the Parable of the Lost Sheep and the Parable of the Lost Coin, this is the last of three parables about loss and redemption that Jesus tells after the Pharisees and religious leaders accuse him of welcoming and eating with \"sinners.\" The father's joy described in the parable reflects divine love: the \"boundless mercy of God,\" and \"God's refusal to limit the measure of his grace.\""

        "content": "A parable of a lost son can also be found in the Mahayana Buddhist Lotus Sutra. The two parables share the premise of a father and son being reunited after a time apart, and several scholars have assumed that one version has influenced the other or that both texts share a common origin. However, an influence of the biblical story on the Lotus sutra is very unlikely given the early dating of the stratum of the sutra containing the Buddhist parable.Both parables document a son who leaves a father. In the Lotus sutra, there is a lapse of decades after which the poor son no longer recognises his wealthy father and is terrified of his father's accumulated power and wealth. When the father sends out some attendants to welcome the son, the son panics. The father then lets the son leave without telling him of their kinship and provides him with a heap of straw to sleep on an employment clearing a pile of dirt.As the decades pass, the father gradually conditions the son to his company and gets him accustomed to special honors. Close to death, the wealthy man reveals his kinship with a public announcement to the whole community. The sutra applies the story to the human quest for omniscience which is unexpectedly received. In the Buddhist parable, the father symbolises the Buddha, and the son symbolises any human being. Their kinship symbolises that any being has Buddha nature. The concealment of the kinship of the father to his son is regarded as a skillful means (Sanskrit: up\u0101ya)."

        "content": "Richard \"Dick\" Morrison, a middle-aged smoker, is at John F. Kennedy International Airport when he encounters Jimmy McCann, his old college roommate and advertisement agency coworker. McCann, who had been a heavy smoker in college, credits a firm called Quitters, Inc. for helping him give it up and recommends that Dick try their services. The firm has a 98% success rate and guarantees that the person will never smoke again. Dick, who works in advertising, is reluctant as he has never seen this firm advertised in billboards or print media, to which McCann says it is a small firm with all the clients they can handle solely by word of mouth. Before leaving, McCann gives a business card to Dick, who promptly pigeonholes it.\nA month later, when Dick is not happy in his job, he resorts to drinking, and Jimmy McCann's business card falls out of Dick's wallet when he pays the bartender. As the address is close to the bar, Dick decides to go to Quitters, Inc. on a lark. Dick is introduced to Victor Donatti, who will be his quitting counselor. Donatti tells the history of Quitters, Inc., that it was founded by a New Jersey mob boss who had been a heavy smoker and realized, before he died of lung cancer, that he must aid others in quitting. Dick is still uneasy, especially as Donatti asks many questions about the Morrison family without revealing the methods used.\nThe following day, Donatti states to Morrison that they have found out all the relevant information about his family. Although Donatti assures Morrison that Quitters, Inc. holds clients' personal information in the strictest confidence, Dick is disgusted and shocked at what has been discovered. Donatti then shows Dick their method: aversion training, demonstrated by electrocuting a rabbit so it would be trained not to eat. Donatti warns Dick that he will be under surveillance and if he is caught smoking, Dick's family will be sent to the \"rabbit room\".\nFor the first month, Dick will have round-the-clock surveillance to ensure he is not smoking and for the second and third months, the surveillance drops down to 18 hours a day (\"but you will never know which eighteen\", cautions Donatti). During the fourth month (when relapses often occur) the surveillance goes back up to 24 hours. From the fifth month until one year in the program, the surveillance will be reduced to 12 hours a day. After that, the surveillance consists of random checks for the remainder of his life. The brutal enforcement methods used by Quitters, Inc. are non-fatal electric shocks of increasing intensity to his wife, Cindy, a second infraction to him, and the third the both of them. A fourth infraction would involve beatings to his son, and subsequent infractions would result in more trips to the shock room with higher voltage, and more painful beatings of his son and wife. After the ninth infraction, his son's arms would be broken. Finally, if Dick commits a 10th infraction, he would be shot to death, with Donatti remarking \"he would become part of the unregenerate 2%\". He ends by affirming the guarantee that even the 2% would never smoke again.\nDonatti says Morrison should not worry too much about the torture, as 40% of Quitters, Inc. clients never violate the agreement at all, and only 10% are subject to a fourth or greater infraction. Donatti says Morrison's greatest problem will probably be temptation as a result of availability, as there is a newspaper stand in the lobby of the very building Quitters, Inc. is situated, and they sell all cigarette brands. Dick's desire to relapse is overcome by fear of the surveillance and torture, which he conceals from his wife in order not to frighten her.\nMonths go by and Dick is faithful to his resolve to quit smoking, even during a point when he drank excessively at a party; he is still sober enough to decline an offer for a smoke. He gradually loses the physical jitters of quitting, but the psychological craving for tobacco stays strong. One day during a stressful traffic jam, Dick's desire overtakes him and he finds an old pack of cigarettes in the glove compartment, lights a cigarette, but stubs it out after only three drags. After the traffic clears, Dick comes home to an empty house and a call from Donatti informing him that they have his wife. Dick heads to Quitters, Inc. only to be restrained by a Mafia enforcer and watches as Cindy is shocked at a low setting. After the shocking, Dick speaks with Cindy in private, who is forgiving and supportive that, according to her, Donatti has \"let him out of a prison\".\nShortly after the shocking, Dick has gained weight and Donatti obtains some prohibited diet pills for him to achieve a target weight. If Dick strays from this goal, Donatti threatens that his wife's right little finger will be cut off. Morrison exercises and keeps in shape, and gives the business card to a barfly, echoing the start of the story. The story ends when Dick and Cindy meet the McCanns, and Dick realizes Jimmy's wife is missing her little finger on her right hand."

        "content": "Stephen King connects his classic horror style with humor in \"Quitters, Inc.\", as he tells the story of how the threat of radical punishment can curb smoking addiction quickly. The names of the main characters of the text, Dick Morrison and Jimmy McCann refer to the tobacco company Philip Morris and the advertising company, McCann. The story portrays the upper-middle-class in the late 1970s, particularly the way in which smoking was widespread in popular culture. When King was writing this story, the movement to quit smoking was starting to become increasingly popular in the United States. This began with the affluent in upper management roles who, like King, could \u2018afford\u2019 the effort to quit smoking. Although King previously wrote about blue-collar characters, there is a shift here in \"Quitters, Inc.\", where King explores the horrors of the upper class.Dr. Katherine Hawley says that through the tale, Stephen King questions how social accountability strategies raise ethical dilemmas around self-control. She writes that outright promises and contracts generate new moral obligations, and when we put other people's interests on the line, we must be realistic about our prospects of success. The formalization of this by promising, like Morrison does to Donatti, adds an ethical dimension. This is to say that, in \"Quitters, Inc.\", even if Morrison succeeds in quitting, the danger he places his family in is morally abhorrent and outrageous, Hawley says.Quitters, Inc. has been utilized to discuss approach to communication of characters in modern American literature. According to Dr. Tatjana Rusko, Mr. Donatti uses an emotional approach to impression management when attempting to intimidate Morrison. She says that when Morrison is at Quitters, Inc. for the first time, Mr. Donatti's speech is unshakable and persuasive. He uses an assertive tone and repetition of the personal pronoun \u2018we\u2019 to present a desired image and, as Rusko writes, a hypnotic effect. She writes that the reference to the well-known guru Dale Carnegie is a hook that Mr. Donatti uses to manipulate Morrison.Mark Browning says that \"Quitters, Inc.\" can be more accurately described as a story of the unexpected. He also draws a link between this story and Roald Dahl\u2019s 1954 story \"Man from the South\", especially as both feature the wife of a minor character having her pinky cut off.Tony Magistrale says that King's fiction is largely satirical in nature, that \"reveals a collective cultural fears and fantasies which go unspoken in everyday life. He writes that Stephen King's work mostly aims to critique a loss of dignity through a lack of self-control and powerlessness. Ben P. Idick says that the terror of King's works, like \"Quitters, Inc.\", is that he combines fear and realism."

        "content": "Stephen King has criticized psychoanalysis several times throughout his career. King tries to convey the evil of behavioral psychology specialists from his point of view, says Dr. Lenore C. Terr. She says that King developed his childhood fear of psychiatry despite the possibility that it could have helped him. In \"Quitters, Inc.\", this manifests in the terrifying addiction counselor Vincent Donatti, and the satire of self-improvement 'guru' Dale Carnegie. This is similar to another story in Night Shift,  \"The Boogeyman\", where a boogeyman that has murdered three young children disguises itself as a psychiatrist. Additionally, as King suffered from insomnia and nightmares in his youth, Terr says that he translated these nightmares to others through his horror fiction.In the early 1970s, King developed a severe alcohol addiction that would persist for more than a decade. His addiction to alcohol, drugs and cigarettes was so severe that King says he barely recalls writing his 1981 novel Cujo. Like Dick Morrison in \"Quitters, Inc.\", Stephen King was dependent on nicotine for decades. He thought of cigarettes as a stimulant for his imagination and says that quitting smoking caused his writing to \u2018slow down\u2019. As a result of this lifelong struggle, addiction was a key theme that appeared in several of King's works, notably Misery (1987) and \"Quitters, Inc.\" (1978)."

Although he had steadily produced work for over a decade (without commercial success), Sarrasine was among his earliest publications to appear without a pseudonym.\nDuring the period in which the novella was written, Balzac was involved in many salons, including that of Madame Recamier. Around the time in which Sarrasine was published, Balzac experienced great success with another work, La Peau de Chagrin (1831). As his career began to take off and his publications began to accumulate, Balzac developed increasingly lavish living habits and frequently made impulsive purchases (such as new furniture for his apartment and a hooded white cashmere gown designed to be worn by a monk, which he wore at night while writing), likely to distance himself from his family's prior debt, which had resulted from his business as an editor and printer's liquidation.\nIn 1841, an ill Balzac reached an agreement with Furne & Co., Dubochet, Hetzel and Paulin to publish La Com\u00e9die humaine. In the 10 years that elapsed, Balzac had developed a political career, becoming heavily involved in high society, which influenced much of his writing. However, he continued to have financial difficulties despite his success, such as with La Cronique de Paris, a magazine he founded and abandoned, though he characteristically hid his worry in order to maintain appearances.\nThe first volume of La Com\u00e9die humaine went on sale in July 1842.

The story focuses on a young boy named Gon Freecss who discovers that his father, who left him at a young age, is actually a world-renowned Hunter, a licensed professional who specializes in fantastical pursuits such as locating rare or unidentified animal species, treasure hunting, surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting down lawless individuals. Gon departs on a journey to become a Hunter and eventually find his father. Along the way, Gon meets various other Hunters and encounters the paranormal.\nHunter \u00d7 Hunter was adapted into a 62-episode anime television series by Nippon Animation and directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi, which ran on Fuji Television from October 1999 to March 2001. Three separate original video animations (OVAs) totaling 30 episodes were subsequently produced by Nippon Animation and released in Japan from 2002 to 2004. A second anime television series by Madhouse aired on Nippon Television from October 2011 to September 2014, totaling 148 episodes, with two animated theatrical films released in 2013. There are also numerous audio albums, video games, musicals, and other media based on Hunter \u00d7 Hunter.\nThe manga has been licensed for English release in North America by Viz Media since April 2005. Both television series have been also licensed by Viz Media, with the first series having aired on the Funimation Channel in 2009 and the second series broadcast on Adult Swim's Toonami programming block from April 2016 to June 2019.\nHunter \u00d7 Hunter has been a huge critical and financial success and has become one of the best-selling manga series of all time, having over 84 million copies in circulation by July 2022."

        "content": "Author Yoshihiro Togashi explained that one of his hobbies was collecting objects of all sorts, so he was inspired to create a manga involving collecting titled \"(something) Hunter\". He came up with the final name Hunter \u00d7 Hunter while watching the television variety show Downtown, in which the hosts often repeat what they say to make the audience laugh. The \"\u00d7\" in the title is silent. As with his previous series, YuYu Hakusho, Togashi used drafting ink and Kabura pens for his illustrations but began using an eMac to color them. Togashi uses few or no assistants in the manga's production; however, fellow manga artist and future wife Naoko Takeuchi assisted Togashi in adding screentone to single-color pages for the first volume. With the birth of their first son early in its publication, Togashi felt that this personal aspect of his life would be a great influence on his work, particularly the manga's theme of a young boy searching for his father.There have been several instances in which Togashi has apologized to readers in Shueisha's Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump for low-quality artwork and promised to redraw portions of the chapters for their tank\u014dbon (collected volume) releases. In addition, the publication history of the Hunter \u00d7 Hunter manga has been plagued with hiatuses since 2006, in which serialized chapters would be separated by extended periods of time. After returning from a two-year-long hiatus in June 2014, and joining the English-language Weekly Shonen Jump lineup, the manga went on another just two months later. The series returned from this hiatus on April 18, 2016, however, just over two months later, Hunter \u00d7 Hunter began another hiatus on June 4, 2016. It came back on June 26, 2017, and just over two months later, on August 31, the series went on hiatus again, planning to return by the end of that year. The series came back on January 29, 2018, before going on hiatus again on April 9 of the same year. After a five-month hiatus, the manga resumed publication from September 22 to November 26, 2018, before entering another hiatus for four years, its longest one to date.In May 2022, Togashi created a Twitter account where he teased that the series would resume publication. In July 2022, Togashi revealed that he was unable to sit in a chair for two years due to his back and hip problems, but was able to resume drawing by doing so while laying down; in August of the same year, Togashi posted on Twitter that he decided to increase his staff, adding that chapter 399's background effects were done according to his request and that chapter 400 would move forward after Togashi hands in his specifications for it. The series resumed publication on October 24, 2022, after a three-year-and-eleven-month hiatus. On December 26, 2022, it was announced that the manga would enter on hiatus. The Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump editorial department published a letter which said that they had consulted with Togashi and decided that the manga should not follow a weekly serialized format going forward, and that once they know concrete details of its return and how it will be serialized, they will reveal the details in the magazine. On March 9, 2023, Togashi tweeted that chapter 401 had been completed, but the form of publication has not been decided at the time. On October 1 of the same year, Togashi made his first tweet in nearly seven months, which contained the phrase \"Start over\" in English, as well as an image depicting the bottom right corner of a page with a ruler below.In November 2023, on TV Asahi's variety show Iwakura and Yoshizumi Show, Togashi announced that he had planned four possible scenarios for the series' finale through a handwritten letter which was read aloud during the program. Only the fourth abandoned ending (\"ending D\") was revealed, stating that it could be considered the ending in case he dies before finishing the manga. This ending takes place after a time skip, years into the future, featuring Gon's granddaughter, Gin. Togashi expressed a desire to create a satisfying enough conclusion so he would not have to resort to endings A, B, or C. Togashi stated that the readers' reactions would be 80% positive on ending A, even split on ending B, and 90% negative on ending C. While acknowledging ending A as a \"safe\", noncontroversial option, Togashi personally preferred ending C, despite expecting significant criticism from fans."

Rutha. The song book had its origins in the libraries of cathedral song schools, whose repertory had strong links with medieval Prague, where clerical students from Finland and Sweden had studied for generations.

        "content": "The Latin text is probably a musical parody of an earlier 12th century song beginning \"intonent hodie voces ecclesie\", written in honour of Saint Nicholas, the patron saint of Russia, sailors and children \u2013 to whom he traditionally brings gifts on his feast day, 6 December. Hugh Keyte and Andrew Parrott note that two of the verses have an unusual double repeat (\"Submersum, -sum, -sum puerum\"; \"Reddens vir-, vir-, vir-ginibus\"). In \"intonent hodie\", these were used to illustrate the three boys and three girls saved by St Nicholas from drowning and prostitution, respectively. The text was probably re-written for the Feast of the Holy Innocents (28 December) when choristers and their \"boy bishop\" traditionally displaced the senior clergy from the choir stalls. The carol is still often associated with Holy Innocents' Day.Songs from Piae Cantiones continued to be performed in Finland until the 19th century. The book became well known in Britain after a rare copy of Piae Cantiones owned by Peter of Nyland was given as a gift to the British Minister in Stockholm. He subsequently gave it to John Mason Neale in 1852, and it was from this copy that Neale, in collaboration with Thomas Helmore published songs in two collections in 1853 and 1854 respectively."

        "content": "The carol became more prominent in England after being arranged for unison voices and orchestra in 1916 by Gustav Holst (1874\u20131934), where in its organ reduction it is often used as a processional hymn in church and cathedral services. Holst's version often forms part of the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols, and was last featured in the service broadcast by BBC2 from King's College Chapel, Cambridge in 2011 following the sixth lesson. This arrangement is sometimes referred to as \"Theodoric\" in reference to the composer's middle name (Theodore) and, in this setting, is the tune used for Percy Dearmer's hymn God is love, his the care.In addition to Holst's version, there is a harmonised choral arrangement by Hugh Keyte and Andrew Parrott in the New Oxford Book of Carols, an arrangement by Antony Pitts in the Naxos Book of Carols and two arrangements by John Rutter; one for choir and full orchestra which emulates percussive medieval instrumentation, and another in his anthology Dancing Day for female or boys voices with harp or piano accompaniment. The Retrover Ensemble's performance for Naxos Records pairs the piece with Gaudete, another carol from Piae Cantiones.A popular arrangement of the carol was written by Dr. Lara Hoggard as a Festival Procession that has been performed with full orchestra and organ  and features a brass introduction and a climatic \"Gloria in excelsis Deo\".Several recorded versions are arranged in a more folk-oriented style: for example, a performance by Maddy Prior and The Carnival Band on their 1987 album A Tapestry of Carols, which utilises period instruments. The female a cappella quartet Anonymous 4 have also recorded the song with its original \"Intonent hodie\" text on their CD Legends of St. Nicholas.The contemporary English cross-disciplinary music ensemble North Sea Radio Orchestra have recorded a small-ensemble instrumental version of the piece arranged for two violins, cello, clarinet, bassoon, oboe, piano, vibraphone, chamber organ and guitar. This appears on their 2008 album Birds.\nJazz musician Wayne Shorter recorded his arrangement of melody under the name 12th Century Carol on his 2003 album Alegria.\nRobert Cummings, writing in the Allmusic guide, states that the \"melody is glorious and ebullient in its lively, triumphant manner. It largely consists of bright, resolute three-note phrases whose overall structure gradually rises, then descends.\"Bass guitarist/composer Chris Squire recorded his arrangement on the 2007 album Chris Squire's Swiss Choir accompanied by guitarist Steve Hackett and the English Baroque Choir."

His Polish origins lead them to suspect that he is trying to distract attention from relatives in the Eastern Bloc.

They still have no real reason to suspect Sebatinsky, but just in case they look for a discreet way to get him out of the classified project in which he is engaged. Much to his surprise (and delight), Sebatinsky is appointed to a senior professorial post, which is exactly what he hoped for when he went to the numerologist.\nAt the end of the story, it is revealed that the numerologist is actually an extraterrestrial and that he was involved in a bet with another extraterrestrial as to whether he could avert a nuclear war on Earth with a minor stimulus.  The story concludes with the same two beings making another bet to put everything back the way it was with another minuscule alteration, with the likely consequence that the world will end in nuclear holocaust after all.\nAsimov comments that the last section of the story was put in as an afterthought. Despite the original happy ending, Asimov was not satisfied, because the numerologist had not been accounted for.

The beginning of the story details the Tercentenary speech by the 57th president, Hugo Allen Winkler, who is described by Secret Service agent Lawrence Edwards as a \"vote-grabber, a promiser\" who has failed to get anything done during his first term in office. While moving through a crowd near the Washington Monument, the President suddenly disappears in a \"glitter of dust\". He reappears very shortly afterwards on a guarded stage and gives a stirring speech which is quite different from the kind he usually makes. Edwards is reminded of rumors of a robot double of the President existing as a security measure, and concludes that the double was assassinated. \nTwo years after that occurrence, the now retired Edwards contacts the Presidents personal secretary, a man named Janek, convinced that it was not the robot double who had died at the Tercentenary, but the President himself, with the robot having then taken office. Edwards points to rumors of an experimental weapon, a disintegrator, and suggests this is the weapon used to assassinate Winkler, as not only does its effect mirror that seen at the Tercentenary, but also made examination of the corpse impossible. He argues that the robot duplicate, posing as the President, retrieved the disintegrator and arranged the assassination. Following the incident, the President has become much more effective, but as Edwards points out, he has also become more reclusive, even towards his own children. The robot, Edward claims, must have concluded that Winkler was too ineffectual to serve as President. The death of one man was acceptable to save three billion, and this is what allowed it to circumvent the First Law of Robotics.\nEdwards implores Janek, as the Presidents closest confidante, to confirm his suspicions and convince the robot to resign, worrying about the precedent set by having a robot ruler.\nFollowing the meeting, Janek decides to have Edwards eliminated to keep him from going public with his findings, and the story ends with the revelation that Janek was the man behind the assassination of the President."

        "content": "In 1974, Los Angeles teenager Todd Bowden arrives at the doorstep of elderly German immigrant Arthur Denker, accusing him of being wanted Nazi war criminal Kurt Dussander. The old man reluctantly acknowledges his true identity. Todd asks to hear detailed stories about his crimes, having recently become interested in the Holocaust. If Dussander refuses his demands, Todd will turn him over to the authorities. Over the next months, Todd visits Dussander daily under the pretext of reading to him, all the while badgering him into revealing more details of his atrocities. Todd soon forces Dussander to wear a replica SS Oberleutnants uniform and march on command.\nOver time, Todd also begins to have nightmares and sees his grades slip. After being confronted by his father about his grades, he forges his report cards before giving them to his parents. Eventually, Todd finds himself in danger of failing several courses. Ed French, Todd's guidance counselor, requests an appointment with the Bowdens. Todd and Dussander concoct a ruse, having Dussander go to French's appointment while posing as Todd's grandfather, Victor. Dussander falsely claims that Todd's grades are the result of problems at home, and promises to make sure his grades improve; French notices Todd's \"grandfather\" does not mention him by name.\nKnowing that Todd has been doctoring his report cards and knowingly socialized with a war criminal, Dussander blackmails him into spending his visits studying. Todd eventually manages to improve his schoolwork. Having no longer any use for Dussander, Todd resolves to kill him and make it look like an accident. Todd had earlier claimed to have given a letter about Dussander to a friend; if anything should happen to Todd, the letter will be sent to the authorities. However, before Todd can kill Dussander, the old man realizes Todd's intentions and claims to have written about Todd's involvement with him, and put his statement into a safe deposit box that will be found upon his death. Both Dussander and Todd are bluffing.\nOver the next few months, Todd murders several homeless vagrants; he finds that committing murder helps with his nightmares. As years pass, his visits to Dussander become less frequent. He loses his virginity, but finds sex unsatisfying compared to the thrill of killing. He thinks his failure at sex is because his girlfriend is Jewish. When circumstances do not allow him to continue his killings, he picks a concealed spot overlooking the freeway and aims at people in passing cars with his hunting rifle. Dussander, suffering from his own nightmares, has also taken to killing the homeless, burying the bodies in his basement. Despite the link between them, Dussander and Todd are not immediately aware of each other's exploits.\nOne night when Dussander is digging a grave for his latest victim, he has a heart attack. He summons Todd, who buries the body and cleans up the crime scene before calling an ambulance. At the hospital, Dussander shares a room with Morris Heisel, an elderly Jewish man and Holocaust survivor who recognizes \"Mr. Denker\" but cannot place him. Todd eventually visits Dussander at the hospital. Dussander has read about the homeless men murdered by Todd and tells him not to get careless.\nA few days later, Heisel realizes Denker is Dussander, the commandant of the camp where his wife and daughters were murdered in gas chambers. Israeli Nazi hunter Weiskopf visits Dussander, saying he has been found out. After Weiskopf leaves, Dussander steals drugs from the hospital dispensary and commits suicide. Police detective Richler, accompanied by Weiskopf, later interviews Todd. A vagrant later recognizes Todd as the last person seen with several of the homeless victims and notifies the police.\nMeanwhile, French meets Todd's real grandfather, who bears no physical resemblance to Dussander. Suspicious, French checks Todd's old report cards, finding that they have been tampered with. Identifying Dussander as the man who he actually met, French confronts Todd, who responds by fatally shooting him. Todd's sanity breaks. He takes his rifle and ammunition to his hideout by the freeway and embarks on a shooting spree, resulting in his death at the hands of the authorities five hours later."

He even references Andy Dufresne by name \u2014 he remembers the name because \"it sounds a little like mine.\" Andy Dufresne is a central character in Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the novella preceding Apt Pupil in Different Seasons.\nWhen confronting Todd about his murders, Dussander mentions a serial killer named \"Springheel Jack\". This killer is the focus of \"Strawberry Spring\", a short story published in the King collection Night Shift (1978).\nThe guidance counselor Ed French mentions his hotel room is number 217, the same as the famous Overlook Hotel room in The Shining. Furthermore, in The Shining, Jack Torrance is working on a play that includes a character named Denker, the same name as Dussander's alter ego.

Set in contemporary Paris, it describes the rise and fall of a brilliant political strategist abandoned by the politicians he helps into power. Destitute and forgotten, he befriends a pair of students who live next door to him in a boarding-house. The story follows their many discussions about the political situation in France.\nBalzac was inspired to write the story after spotting the name \"Z. Marcas\" on a sign for a tailor's shop in Paris. It was published in July 1840, in the Revue Parisienne, a magazine he had founded that year. One year later, it appeared in a collection from various authors under the title La Mort d'un ambitieux (\"The Death of an Ambitious Man\"). Balzac later placed it in the Sc\u00e8nes de la vie politique section of his vast novel sequence La Com\u00e9die humaine.\nAlthough Z. Marcas features characters from other Balzac stories and elements of literary realism \u2013 both hallmarks of Balzac's style \u2013 it is remembered primarily for its political themes. Balzac, a legitimist, believed that France's lack of bold leadership had led to mediocrity and ruin, and that men of quality were being ignored or worse. He maintained that the youth of France were in danger of being abandoned by the government, and predicted unrest in the years to come.\nThe story also explores Balzac's conviction that a person's name is a powerful indicator of his or her destiny, an idea he drew from the work of Laurence Sterne. The title character, with his keen intellect, is based on Balzac's conception of himself: a visionary genius who fails to achieve his true potential because of less talented individuals with more social power."

After studying the law for three years, he wrote a number of potboiler novels under various pseudonyms. He also lost large sums of borrowed money in the publishing trade, attempting to capitalize on cheap editions of classical works. By 1828 he owed his mother 50,000 francs.Although his views on politics were always changing, Balzac was primarily a legitimist who supported the House of Bourbon and believed that the July Revolution of 1830 had left France without strong leadership. In 1832 he declared his intent to run for the Chamber of Deputies in the French Parliament. A variety of problems prevented his actual candidacy, but he mounted a serious campaign which was met mostly with ridicule by the press. Referring to Balzac's breakthrough 1831 novel La Peau de chagrin (\"The Wild Ass's Skin\"), the newspaper Le Figaro mused: \"This is the first time anyone has been seen caressing the voters with an ass's skin.\" Although he later showed renewed interest in public office, he mostly expressed his political views through writing.In July 1840 he attempted to fuse his desire to make money with his politics by founding a magazine called the Revue Parisienne, funded by his friend Armand Dutacq. Having already worked in the publishing industry, Balzac believed he had learned all there was to know about the trade. \"[T]hat gigantic machine known as journalism\", he wrote, \"is as simple as a roasting spit turned by a poodle.\" Balzac planned to publish his own fiction in the Revue Parisienne, in part to challenge the popularity of the roman-feuilleton serial format. Dutacq, however, stopped funding the project in September, after only three issues, and Balzac's final foray into the world of publishing came to an end."

Does it not seem to you that its owner must be doomed to martyrdom? Though foreign, savage, the name has a right to be handed down to posterity; it is well constructed, easily pronounced, and has the brevity that beseems a famous name ... Do you not discern in that letter Z an adverse influence? Does it not prefigure the wayward and fantastic progress of a storm-tossed life?\nThe narrator, Charles, lives with his friend Juste in a large boarding-house populated almost entirely with students like themselves (Charles is studying law and Juste medicine). The sole exception is their middle-aged neighbor, Z. Marcas, of whom they see only momentary glimpses in the hall. They learn that he is a copyist, and living on an extremely small salary. When the students find themselves lacking the funds for tobacco, Marcas offers them some of his own. They become friends, and he tells them the story of his political career.\nRecognizing at an early age that he had an incisive mind for politics, Marcas had allied himself with an unnamed man of some fame who lacked wisdom and insight. They became a team, with the other man serving as the public face and Marcas as the advisor. Once his associate had ascended into office, however, he abandoned Marcas, then hired and abandoned him again. Marcas was left poor and unknown, resigned to duplicate the writing of others for very little pay.\nEventually his politician friend seeks his help for a third time. Marcas is dismissive, but the students convince him to give the process one last chance. After three months, Marcas appears at the boarding house again, sick and exhausted. The politician never visits Marcas, who soon dies. The students are the only mourners at his funeral, and \u2013 disheartened by the tragedy \u2013 leave France."

The story's first line refers to his \"saisissant\" (\"striking\") appearance. As usual in his later work, Balzac describes Marcas by relating him to an animal: \"L'animal de Marcas \u00e9tait le lion. Ses cheveux ressemblaient \u00e0 une crini\u00e8re, son nez \u00e9tait court, \u00e9cras\u00e9, large et fendu au bout comme celui d'un lion, il avait le front partag\u00e9 comme celui d'un lion par un sillon puissant, divis\u00e9 en deux lobes vigoureux.\" (\"The animal for Marcas was the lion. His hair was like a mane, his nose was short and flat; broad and dented at the tip like a lion's; his brow, like a lion's, was strongly marked with a deep median furrow, dividing two powerful bosses.\")Marcas appears to be destined for greatness; he is described as having tremendous spirit, sound but speedy judgment, and comprehensive knowledge of public manners. His gaze has \"une puissance\" (\"a power\"), which he tries not to use, since it has brought him nothing but misery in the past. Despite these innate proficiencies, however, the political genius living in the students' midst requires their aid to dress himself when official company comes to call.The character of Z. Marcas nonetheless represents a fiery drive to succeed in the world of politics, an acute mind seeking to do good in the public sphere. One critic calls him \"ambition in its pure state\". Like other persons of genius in La Com\u00e9die humaine, Marcas is seen as a reflection of Balzac's own ego and desire. Like Marcas, the author dreamed of fame and positive influence; as Balzac believed himself to be, the character is dismissed and manipulated by mediocre minds. Even their work habits \u2013 toiling at their desks throughout the night \u2013 are similar."

Marcas is cited as an example of the author's \"zeal\" for \"close local color\". Balzac's belief in the connection between one's name and one's destiny is brought to the fore; the pattern demonstrated in Z. Marcas reflects many in the larger collection of Balzac's work. As critic Charles Affron puts it: \"The creator of a universe so tied up with inner rhythms and resounding with so many echoes does not hesitate to imply that the germs of a character's failure can be found in the physical qualities of his name.\" This idea came to Balzac from Laurence Sterne, as he acknowledged in his 1841 story Ursule Mirou\u00ebt: \"[N]e doit-on pas reconna\u00eetre avec Sterne l'occulte puissance des noms, qui tant\u00f4t raillent et tant\u00f4t pr\u00e9disent les caract\u00e8res?\" (\"Should we not agree with Sterne in recognizing the occult power in names, which sometimes mock and sometimes define the characters of their possessors?\")Z. Marcas includes many other examples of realist detail as well. The students live in shabby environs, furnished by \"qu'un maigre tapis en lisi\u00e8re\" (\"only a scrap of thin carpet\"). They share \"une blonde perruque de tabac turc\" (\"a tawny twig of Turkish tobacco\") with their neighbor, and the three discuss political personalities drawn directly from recent history, including William Pitt the Elder and the Voltigeurs. Still, realist detail is not commonly in the foreground of commentary about Z. Marcas. As Hunt explains, it is mostly remembered \"as a vehicle for a characteristic Balzacian whimsy\"."

Marcas' has then become, not the story of one particular, political failure, not the story of a young man of potential who abandons France for Malaysia, but the story of France herself, wasting away and thus losing her greatest resource \u2013 her youth.\"Balzac believed that the July Monarchy had brought a wave of poor leadership, and that people of quality and integrity were scorned in the name of cronyism. Marcas, a prime example of such a man, is doomed to fail in the government of Louis-Philippe. Those in power were blind to the valuable minds being lost in their midst, as the students discover early in the story: \"nous \u00e9tions \u00e9tonn\u00e9s de la brutale indiff\u00e9rence du pouvoir pour tout ce qui tient \u00e0 l'intelligence, \u00e0 la pens\u00e9e, \u00e0 la po\u00e9sie\" (\"we were amazed at the brutal indifference of the authorities to everything connected with intellect, thought, and poetry\"). Marcas' personal woes \u2013 and his tales of life within the corridors of power \u2013 strongly reinforce this view.Through Marcas, Balzac claimed that young people in France were being ignored by government officials, and predicted an uprising:\n\n La jeunesse \u00e9clatera comme la chaudi\u00e8re d'une machine \u00e0 vapeur. La jeunesse n'a pas d'issue en France, elle y amasse une avalanche de capacit\u00e9s m\u00e9connues, d'ambitions l\u00e9gitimes et inqui\u00e8tes, elle se marie peu, les familles ne savent que faire de leurs enfants; quel sera le bruit qui \u00e9branlera ces masses, je ne sais; mais elles se pr\u00e9cipiteront dans l'\u00e9tat de choses actuel et le bouleverseront.\nYouth will explode like the boiler of a steam-engine. Youth has no outlet in France; it is gathering an avalanche of underrated capabilities, of legitimate and restless ambitions; young men are not marrying now; families cannot tell what to do with their children. What will the thunderclap be that will shake down these masses? I know not, but they will crash down into the midst of things, and overthrow everything. As Graham Robb indicates in his 1994 biography, Balzac's words were an accurate prediction of the 1848 Revolution. Public opposition to the monarchy exploded in February of that year, Louis-Philippe was forced to abdicate, and the Second Republic was founded."

Hunt notes that it has \"only subsidiary value\", but biographer Andr\u00e9 Maurois calls it \"an admirable tale\". Robb notes that Z. Marcas was an important herald of political realities to come, and provided a warning to the political class of the time.As critic F\u00e9licien Marceau points out, however, the greatest value of Z Marcas may have been for the author himself.\n\n[T]he story has somewhat the appearance of those drawings by Leonardo da Vinci consisting of twenty or thirty feet or hands, perfectly drawn in themselves, but whose raison d'\u00eatre lies rather in the fact that they will enable the artist to address himself later on to much vaster compositions, in which such hands and feet will assume their true placement and importance. We shall find the traits gathered together in the character of Marcas\u2014though more scattered, mingled with others, scaled down to less overwhelming proportions\u2014in [Eug\u00e8ne de] Rastignac or [Henri de] Marsay, whose characters are less of a piece but more true to life. Marcas, on the other hand, is less a character than a moral example."

Viewed through the analytic lens of Russell's knowledge by description, the story explores the interesting concept of knowledge of Self by description (as opposed to the more expected knowledge by acquaintance). This is emphasized by the mention of receiving Borges's mail and reading about Borges in a book.\nAlso, the distinction between persona and Self can be interpreted as a distinction between author and writer. The author would be analogous to the persona and Borges. The writer would be the Self and \"I\". Theoretically, the writer could be anyone, it just happens to be Borges.

This allows for an analysis in linguistic weight assigned to various typological and stylistic aspects of language which revolve around the difference between an analytic language like English with a language like German that is a synthetic language with some analytic characteristics. Twain emphasizes these changes through interlinear translation, a manner of translation which tries to preserve the original language without context and in a literal manner, and this method emphasizes the mechanics of the language translated."

A slightly further revised version was published that summer in July 1776 in Toplady's hymnal Psalms & Hymns for Public and Private Worship.There is a popular story most hymnologists do not believe about the origin of this hymn text. That story was started 122 years after publication of the hymn text by a letter published in the Times [of London], June 3, 1898 from Dean Lefroy of Norwich, together with one from Sir W. H. Wills on the same matter. The burden of Lefroy\u2019s correspondence is based on a claim made by Sir W. H. Wills regarding the origin of this hymn. Wills' claim asserted that Toplady drew his inspiration from an incident in the gorge of Burrington Combe in the Mendip Hills in England. Toplady, then a curate (assistant Church of England preacher) in the nearby village of Blagdon, was travelling along the gorge when he was caught in a storm. Finding shelter in a gap in the gorge, he was struck by the title and scribbled down the initial lyrics.\nAccording to E. J. Fasham, a more likely inspiration for the text is a 1673 sermon by Daniel Brevint (who had been the Dean of Durham Cathedral). This sermon had been partially quoted in the preface to Charles Wesley's Hymns of the Lord's Supper (1745), which was in common use amongst a number of ministers of the period. The similarity between the passages from Brevint's sermon and the hymn suggests this was the starting point for Toplady's text."

However, Toplady's own published 1776 hymn text, the version now referred to as 'alt', contains a variant different from Wesley's teachings and reads: \"Be of sin the double cure, Save me from its guilt and power\"."

After the event, the librarian who had invited her, Ramona Norville, tells Tess to avoid Interstate 84. She gives Tess the directions to Stagg Road, a presumably safer shortcut to Tess' home in Connecticut. However, on the shortcut, Tess' Ford Expedition rolls over nail-studded pieces of wood which lie across the road, giving her a flat tire. The incident happens near an abandoned Esso gas station.\nShortly afterwards, a tall man in a pickup truck offers to assist Tess and change her tire. At first he seems to be eager to help, but Tess soon realizes that he had set out the road hazard as a trap. The trucker knocks Tess out and proceeds to beat her and rape her several times, before finally choking her to unconsciousness. Tess later wakes up but feigns death as he stashes her body in a culvert and drives away. She escapes, but not before discovering the corpses of two other women, all victims of the same culprit, dead and in various states of decomposition in the culvert. Tess attempts to find some help but worries that the attack will create a scandal that will negatively affect her career. She resolved to not tell anyone about the assault.\nThe next day, while recovering her Expedition at a bar called the Stagger Inn, Tess speaks with an employee named Betsy. Tess fabricates a story about her injuries and tells Betsy a man helped her, taking the opportunity to fish for details about her rapist. Betsy identifies the man as \"Big Driver\". Tess decides to use the detective skills she acquired while writing her novels to find him.\nTess discovers that Big Driver's mother is Ramona, deducing that she intentionally directed her into the trap. Tess goes to Ramona's home and, after confirming that she was indeed guilty of intentionally directing Tess into the trap, kills her. Tess then finds Big Driver's address and goes to his house. She lies in wait and shoots him after he arrives home. It is only after he is dead that Tess determines that the man she just killed, Big Driver, was not the man who raped her; he was the older brother of the man who raped her, \"Little Driver\". Stunned, Tess nevertheless drives to Little Driver's house and kills him too.\nUnsure of Big Driver's involvement in her rape, and overcome with guilt over possibly having murdered an innocent man, she writes out a confession and prepares to kill herself. At the last moment, however, she decides to go back to Big Driver's house to look for evidence. There she finds the purse taken from her the night of the rape, confirming Big Driver's complicity in the crime. Tess comes to terms with her sins and goes home, finally beginning to feel peace."

Alyosha is the saintly but dim-witted son of Prince Valkovsky, who hopes to gain financially by marrying Alyosha off to an heiress, Katya. Valkovsky's cruel machinations to break up Alyosha and Natasha identify him as one of the most memorable \"predatory types\" that Dostoevsky created. The other plotline focuses on a thirteen-year-old orphan, Nellie, whom Vanya saves from an abusive household by taking her into his apartment, and whose deceased mother's story in some ways parallels that of Natasha. It's unusual to see a well-developed character as young as Nellie in a Dostoevsky novel, but Nellie may be one of his most moving creations, and she in particular shows the influence of Dickens (Dostoevsky is known to have read Dickens during the Siberian exile; this novel was conceived near the end of this exile)."

The only friend that remains by Natasha's side is Ivan \u2013 her childhood friend who is deeply in love with her, and whom Natasha has rejected despite their being engaged.\nPrince Valkovsky tries to destroy Alyosha's plans to marry Natasha, and wants to make him marry the rich princess Katerina. Alyosha is a na\u00efve but lovable young man who is easily manipulated by his father. Following his father's plan, Alyosha falls in love with Katerina, but still loves Natasha. He is constantly torn between these two women, too indecisive and infatuated with both to make a decision. Eventually, Natasha sacrifices her own feelings and withdraws in order for Alyosha to choose Katerina.\nMeanwhile, Ivan rescues an orphan girl, Elena (known as Nellie), from the clutches of a procuress and learns that her mother ran away from her father's (Jeremy Smith's) home with her sweetheart, a man who abandoned her when Nellie's mother gave birth. It is later revealed that Prince Valkovsky is Nellie's father. Her parents were legally married, but Prince Valkovsky persuaded his young and innocent wife to rob her father, Jeremy. After moving to Petersburg, Nellie's mother asks her father for forgiveness, but he rejects them. Before dying, Nellie's mother makes Nellie promise to never go to her real father, whose name is on a document she leaves her daughter. \nIn an attempt to make Nikolai (Natasha's father) reconcile with Natasha, Ivan persuades Nikolai and his wife to adopt Nellie. By telling them her life story, Nellie makes Nikolai's heart soften and he forgives Natasha and removes his curse, and they are reunited. Natasha's family plans to move from Petersburg, but just before they leave Nellie dies from a chronic heart condition; the little girl makes it clear to Ivan she does not forgive her father for his cruel treatment of her mother.

In short, for someone to be born, someone else must first volunteer to die. As a result, births are few and far between, and deaths occur primarily by accident.\nThe scene is a waiting room at the Chicago Lying-In Hospital, where Edward K. Wehling Jr. is faced with the situation that his wife is about to give birth to triplets, but he has found only one person, his maternal grandfather, who will volunteer to die. A painter on a stepladder is redecorating the room with a mural depicting employees who work at the Hospital, including Dr. Benjamin Hitz, the hospital's Chief Obstetrician. Leora Duncan, from the Service Division of the Federal Bureau of Termination, arrives to pose for the mural. It is a picture of a garden that is well taken care of, and a metaphor for the United States at the time. Later, Dr. Hitz enters the scene and converses with everyone but the painter of the mural.\nIt becomes apparent to all that Wehling is in a state of despair since he does not want to send his grandfather and two of his children to death. Dr. Hitz questions Wehling's belief in the system and tries to make Wehling feel better by explaining how the surviving child will \"live on a happy, roomy, clean, rich planet.\" Suddenly, Wehling draws a revolver and kills Dr. Hitz, Leora Duncan, and himself, \"making room for all three children.\"\nThe painter, who is about 200 years old, is left to reflect on the scene and thinks about life, war, plague, and starvation. Descending the stepladder, he initially takes the revolver and intends to kill himself with it but is unable to do so. Instead, he calls the Bureau of Termination to make an appointment. The last line is from the receptionist at the Bureau:\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said the hostess. \"Your city thanks you; your country thanks you; your planet thanks you. But the deepest thanks of all is from all of the future generations.\""

        "content": "The story begins with the sexton standing in front of the meeting-house, ringing the bell. He is to stop ringing the bell when the Reverend Mr. Hooper comes into sight. However, the congregation is met with an unusual sight: Mr. Hooper is wearing a black semi-transparent veil that obscures all of his face but his mouth and chin from view. This creates a stir among the townspeople, who begin to speculate about his veil and its significance.\nAs he takes the pulpit, Mr. Hooper's sermon is on secret sin and is \"tinged, rather more darkly than usual, with the gentle gloom of Mr. Hooper's temperament\". This topic concerns the congregation who fear for their own secret sins as well as their minister's new appearance. After the sermon, a funeral is held for a young lady of the town who has died. Mr. Hooper stays for the funeral and continues to wear his now more appropriate veil. It is said that if the veil were to blow away, he might be \"fearful of her glance\". Mr. Hooper says a few prayers and the body is carried away. Two of the mourners say that they have had a fancy that \"the minister and the maiden's spirit were walking hand in hand\". That night another occasion arises, this time a joyous one\u2014a wedding. However, Mr. Hooper arrives in his veil again, bringing the atmosphere of the wedding down to gloom.\nBy the next day, even the local children are talking of the strange change that seems to have come over their minister. Yet, no one is able to ask Mr. Hooper directly about the veil, except for his fianc\u00e9e Elizabeth. Elizabeth tries to be cheerful and have him take it off. He will not do so, even when they are alone together, nor will he tell her why he wears the veil. Eventually, she gives up and tells him goodbye, breaking off the engagement.\nThe one positive benefit of the veil is that Mr. Hooper becomes a more efficient clergyman, gaining many converts who feel that they too are behind the black veil with him. Dying sinners call out for him alone. Mr. Hooper lives his life thus, though he is promoted to Father, until his death. According to the text, \"All through life the black veil had hung between him and the world: it had separated him from cheerful brotherhood and woman's love, and kept him in that saddest of all prisons, his own heart; and still it lay upon his face, as if to deepen the gloom of his dark-some chamber, and shade him from the sunshine of eternity\".\nEven though Elizabeth broke off their engagement, she never marries and still keeps track of the happenings of Hooper's life from afar. When she finds out that he is deathly ill she comes to his death bed to be by his side. Elizabeth and the Reverend ask him once again to remove the veil, but he refuses. As he dies, those around him tremble. He tells them in anger not to tremble, not merely for him but for themselves, for they all wear black veils. Father Hooper is buried with the black veil on his face."

        "content": "Like many of Hawthorne's works, the setting of the story is a town in Puritan New England. The scene provides the backdrop for a psychological exploration of the themes of sin, repentance, and morality. Much of the story focuses on the acrimonious reaction of the congregation to the seemingly benign veil. Hawthorne uses their reaction as a critique of the Puritan image of original sin, using the veil as a representation not of \"secret sin\" but the inherent sinful nature of all people.The story is both allegorical and didactic. The main themes are hidden sin and underlying guilt, with Hooper's method of preaching being to wear his sin on his face in a literal way. The townspeople grow uncomfortable with him because they start to become aware of their own sin. Hawthorne keeps the motive of the veil unknown to the reader. But the interpretation of the story generally rests on some moral assessment or explanation of the minister's symbolic self-veiling. Literary critic Edgar Allan Poe proposed that the issue of the minister's self-veiling was a mystery conceived to be solved or inferred by the reader. While Poe proposed this, Hawthorne never lets the reader know the reasoning behind the veil. While the veil is the main symbol in the story, it is also ironic. Hooper, in his stubborn use of the veil parable of one sin, is unconsciously guilty of a greater sin: that of egotistically warping the total meaning of life. In addition to standing for a man's concealment or hypocrisy and for Hooper's own sin of pride with its isolating effects, it stands also for the hidden quality of second sin. Hawthorne's use of ambiguity can be portrayed in many different ways: the manipulation of setting, manipulation of lighting and effects, and the use of an unreliable narrator to weave a shocking story that could or could not be likely. The narrator's credibility tends to be questionable because it is not a direct source. In using a third-person narrator, the minister's motives are never solidified, which keeps up the suspense.Hidden nature of guilt: Hooper arouses in a sermon the notion of secret sin and the sad mysteries in which we hide from our nearest and dearest. Hooper acknowledges the problem of sin, the guilt that is admitted openly, and the guilt of sin that is repressed or hidden from the world. When the Reverend Hooper makes the people aware of the darkness within his being, he  dissolves the barrier between his repugnant, repressed self and his conscious self. This barrier is characterized by the veil, which is transferred into the expression of hidden guilt. Hooper, in the story, announces to the congregation at his bedside that everyone wears a black veil; he implies that everyone has some form of secret guilt.\nCommunion of sinners: Hooper leads the townspeople in realizing that everyone shares sin no matter how much they try to avoid facing it. All people sin and it is up to them whether they face their sin or ignore it.  Hooper tries to teach a lesson.  In content, the lesson may be very much like the sermon on \"secret sin\" Hooper was scheduled to teach, but the townspeople are uncomfortable with the medium. The veil is something they have to see every day, rather than a sermon just once or twice a week.Morality: Hawthorne's use of Hooper's veil teaches that whether we face it or not, we all sin and must accept what we have done, because judgment will come for everyone. Hooper decides to represent hidden sin and guilt in a literal way to reach out to his followers.John H. Timmerman notes that because of Hawthorne's writing style Hooper's insistent use of the black veil, Hooper stands as one of his arch-villains. This is from Hooper's act of separating himself from the rest of humanity and denying his love for Elizabeth in favor of the veil."

Hawthorne received a mixed review from Poe, who writes that \"high imaginations gleam from every page\". He notes, however, that versatility is lacking in Hawthorne's tone and character development. Poe claims that Hawthorne is a man of \"truest genius\" but needs to work on subject areas of his writing.

Politicians, commentators, and activists widely cited the paper in political debates over the effectiveness of austerity in fiscal policy for debt-burdened economies. The paper argues that when \"gross external debt reaches 60 percent of GDP\", a country's annual growth declined by two percent, and \"for levels of external debt in excess of 90 percent\" GDP growth was \"roughly cut in half.\" Appearing in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, the evidence for the 90%-debt threshold hypothesis provided support for pro-austerity policies.In 2013, academic critics accused Reinhart and Rogoff of employing methodology that suffered from 3 major errors; they asserted that the underlying data did not support the authors' conclusions. These critics held that the Reinhart\u2013Rogoff paper had led to unjustified adoption of austerity policies for countries with various levels of public debt.Further papers by Rogoff and Reinhart,\nand the International Monetary Fund, which were not found to contain similar errors, reached conclusions similar to the initial paper, though with much lower impact on GDP growth. The threshold hypothesis retains adherents as well as critics, who suggest that the thresholds in the relation between public debt and economic growth lack robustness, so a consensus on the 90%-threshold hypothesis in the relation between public debt and economic growth has been elusive. A 2022 meta-analysis was unable to reject the null hypothesis after controlling for publication bias."

Representative Ryan's \"Path to Prosperity\" reports (Ryan 2013 p. 78):\nA well-known study completed by economists Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart confirms this common-sense conclusion. The study found conclusive empirical evidence that gross debt (meaning all debt that a government owes, including debt held in government trust funds) exceeding 90 percent of the economy has a significant negative effect on economic growth.\nRR have clearly exerted a major influence in recent years on public policy debates over the management of government debt and fiscal policy more broadly. Their findings have provided significant support for the austerity agenda that has been ascendant in Europe and the United States since 2010.\nOlli Rehn, EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs, in his address to the International Labour Organization on April 9, 2013, used the Reinhart\u2013Rogoff paper to argue that \"public debt in Europe is expected to stabilise only by 2014 and to do so at above 90% of GDP. Serious empirical research has shown that at such high levels, public debt acts as a permanent drag on growth.\"British Member of Parliament George Osborne (who became Chancellor of the Exchequer in 2010) relied on the paper to portray excess debt as the universal cause of financial crises: \"As Rogoff and Reinhart demonstrate convincingly, all financial crises ultimately have their origins in one thing.\""

        "content": "The paper was published in an annual \"Papers and Proceedings\" edition of The American Economic Review that was not subject to the same peer-review standards that other editions use before publication. Reinhart and Rogoff (RR) did not publish the data sample upon which they based their conclusions, but they made it available upon request to Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash and Robert Pollin (HAP), who then closely examined the data used in the study.\nIn April 2013, HAP released a critique of the RR data analysis in the working paper \"Does High Public Debt Consistently Stifle Economic Growth? A Critique of Reinhart and Rogoff\", later published in the Cambridge Journal of Economics. They contend that the statistical analyses performed on the data in the original RR Excel spreadsheet (which were used to support the conclusions of the paper) were flawed: \"While using RR's working spreadsheet, we identified coding errors, selective exclusion of available data, and unconventional weighting of summary statistics.\" Using RR's working spreadsheet, but correcting for the claimed errors, HAP found:When properly calculated, the average real GDP growth rate for countries carrying a public-debt-to-GDP ratio of over 90 percent is actually 2.2 percent, not \u22120.1 percent as published in Reinhart and Rogoff. That is, contrary to RR, average GDP growth at public debt/GDP ratios over 90 percent is not dramatically different than when debt/GDP ratios are lower.\nHAP also argued that the sample was biased, claiming that RR selectively omitted data for Australia, Canada, and New Zealand for the early post-World War II period, which showed high growth despite large public debts, while including data for the United States for the same period that showed negative GDP growth, which Herndon attributed to demobilization of U.S. military personnel. Also, by using only one year's data for New Zealand, a negative 7.6% GDP growth in 1951, a year in which New Zealand's trade suffered from a major strike, the average central tendency of the available 5 years (1946\u20131949 and 1951) shifted from 2.6% to \u22127.6%.HAP concluded that the \"combination of the collapse of the empirical result that high public debt is inevitably associated with greatly reduced GDP growth and the weakness of the theoretical mechanism under current conditions... render the Reinhart and Rogoff point close to irrelevant for current public policy debate.\"RR published a lengthy, detailed response to HAP in The New York Times:\nHerndon, Ash and Pollin accurately point out the coding error that omits several countries from the averages in figure 2. Full stop. HAP are on point.... HAP go on to note some other missing debt data points [New Zealand], which they describe as \"selective omissions.\" This charge, which permeates through their paper, is one we object to in the strongest terms.... Data for New Zealand for the years around WWII had just been incorporated and we had not vetted the comparability and quality data with data for the more recent period.... They argue that we use an \"unconventional weighting of summary statistics.\" In particular, for each bucket, we take average growth rates for each country and then take an average of the result. This seems perfectly natural to us, and hardly unconventional.\nEconomics professor L. Randall Wray criticized Reinhart and Rogoff for combining data \"across centuries, exchange rate regimes, public and private debt, and debt denominated in foreign currency as well as domestic currency,\" in addition to \"statistical errors,\" and for lacking a \"theory of sovereign currency\".Other critiques point out that any correspondence between debt levels and insufficient economic growth could just as easily be reversed: it is the weak economic growth that leads to the high debt levels. Others have argued that the relationship between debt and growth varies significantly between countries, meaning that an average \"rule\", such as that suggested by Reinhart and Rogoff, has little meaning or policy relevance.Economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote in 2013:\nWhat the Reinhart-Rogoff affair shows is the extent to which austerity has been sold on false pretenses. For three years, the turn to austerity has been presented not as a choice but as a necessity. Economic research, austerity advocates insisted, showed that terrible things happen once debt exceeds 90 percent of G.D.P. But \"economic research\" showed no such thing; a couple of economists made that assertion, while many others disagreed. Policy makers abandoned the unemployed and turned to austerity because they wanted to, not because they had to."

The subjects range from very practical and detailed advice ranging from such issues as how pedestrians can avoid being hit by cars in the blackout to quite Utopian and far-reaching schemes for the post-war reconstruction of Britain.\nThe letters also expressed Sayers's displeasure with the appeasement policies of Neville Chamberlain in the previous years, and her doubts about his fitness to lead Britain in war (at the time of writing, it was not yet known that Chamberlain would soon be replaced by Winston Churchill). The papers also attributed to Harriet Vane a reluctance to go on writing murder mysteries at the time when European dictators were committing mass murders openly and with impunity. This seems to have been Sayers's own feeling, as she in  fact abandoned during World War II the writing of murder mysteries and never took it up again.\nThere is a repeated unfavorable opinion of the Soviet Union, in the aftermath of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact and the Soviet attack on Finland. The opinion that there was little to choose between communism and fascism, and that the two kinds of dictatorship are equally reprehensible, is given special prominence by being attributed to Lord Peter Wimsey himself. Other characters are shown as expressing the opinion that, even had Britain managed to conclude an alliance with the Soviet Union in 1939, the Soviets would have proven an unreliable ally of little military worth, given their army's weak performance in Finland. On this point Sayers' opinion, like that of most other Britons, did not change in 1941. Getting the Soviets on Britain's side was highly welcome, but the lamentable performance and mass surrenders of the Red Army seemed to bear out the negative assessment. It was only in 1942, when the Germans lost an Army at Stalingrad and American supplies started flowing in, that the resiliency and true strength of Russia became apparent.\nThe papers do provide some significant new details about Wimsey's character, in particular the ironic epitaph he writes for himself when setting out for a dangerous mission behind enemy lines: Here lies an anachronism in the vague expectation of eternity. They also show that in addition to his thorough knowledge of the classics of English literature, Wimsey is familiar \u2013 though in fundamental disagreement \u2013 with the works of Karl Marx, and well able to debate with Marxists on their home ground."

It was first published by The Independent Journal (New York) on January 12, 1788, under the pseudonym Publius, the name under which all The Federalist papers were published. Madison continues his topic from Federalist No. 37, the political questions examined by the constitutional convention. The essay is titled \"The Same Subject Continued, and the Incoherence of the Objections to the New Plan Exposed\". In it Madison argues that despite the many objections to the Constitution, it is still a vast and necessary improvement over the Articles of Confederation.\nThe essay mostly addresses the concern of imperfections in the new government.  It covers history of the formation of governments, starting with the Minoans.  The text is also notable for a single mention of slavery:\n\"It is a matter both of wonder and regret, that those who raise so many objections against the new Constitution should never call to mind the defects of that which is to be exchanged for it. It is not necessary that the former should be perfect; it is sufficient that the latter is more imperfect...Is the importation of slaves permitted by the new Constitution for twenty years? By the old it is permitted forever.\""

It is sung at the beginning of the film by the clown-like gypsy, Clopin. It is set mainly in the key of D minor. The lyrics of the song bear some similarity to the poem The Bells by Edgar Allan Poe, especially the repetition of the word \"bells\" during the crescendo. The song is reprised at the end of the film.\nThe music is based on Prelude in C-sharp minor Op. 3 No. 2 by Sergei Rachmaninoff, which is sometimes colloquially referred to as \"The Bells of Moscow\"."

One of the side effects of this was that a backstory had to be fabricated to explain what Frollo was doing caring for Quasimodo in the first place. The notion that \"Frollo is encouraged by the Archdeacon of Notre Dame to raise Quasimodo as his own, to atone for killing the baby's gypsy mother\" on the stairs of the church had to be explained in the opening scene of the musical, and that was the catalyst for the song's creation. Disney Voice Actors: A Biographical Dictionary explains that \"the opening sequence of [the film] was originally all narration and the result was deemed too lifeless so ['The Bells of Notre Dame'] was written\".Alan Menken said \"It's a really rich number and I think it's possibly the best opening number I've ever written for any project\"."

When the only woman amongst the gypsies is seen carrying a bundle, one of Frollo's guards attempts to confiscate it, prompting her to flee. Frollo pursues her on his horse, thinking her bundle contains stolen goods, in an intense chase through the streets that comes to a head on the steps of Notre Dame. The woman bangs on the door pleading for sanctuary, but Frollo catches up to her before anyone can answer.\nFrollo grabs the bundle from her, but in doing so strikes a blow to her head with his boot, causing her to fall down onto the stone steps, breaking her neck and killing her instantly. Frollo discovers that the bundle is actually a deformed baby boy. Horrified by the child's appearance, he spots a well nearby and attempts to drown the baby he sees as a demon from Hell, but is stopped by the Archdeacon, who admonishes Frollo for killing an innocent woman on holy ground. Frollo callously tries to dismiss his actions, but the Archdeacon doesn't believe him and declares that no amount of lying will hide what he has done from \"the eyes of Notre Dame\" (belonging to the decorative statues built into the structure and used as a metaphor for God and His Angels).\nFearing for his immortal soul, Frollo nervously asks what he must do to atone for his sins and the Archdeacon replies that he must raise the orphaned child as his own. Frollo reluctantly agrees on the condition that the baby remains hidden in the bell tower of Notre Dame, hoping that one day the child may be of some use to him, and gives the child a cruel name; Quasimodo, which, according to Clopin, means \"half-formed\". Clopin ends the song with a riddle: \"Who is the monster and who is the man?\" And as he does, he uses puppetry to show Quasimodo growing up until he reached 20 years of age. The scene then shifts to the real Quasimodo ringing the bells."

        "content": "The film itself, like most Disney Renaissance films, contains valuable moral information and so, in a way, can be called a \"teaching story\", besides being entertainment. This is one function of stories that are told to children: to give them, at least, the basic understanding of attitudes and behaviors encountered in the real world. Through the story of the song, Clopin tells the children that it is a tale of \"a man and a monster\". Towards the end he gives them a riddle for them to guess whilst being told the rest of the story, that being: \"Who is the monster and who is the man?\", thus introducing the major theme of the film. What is meant by these words is to get behind what often are merely appearances, and by doing so we get to the actual truth. This aspect of the story can be related to real life because people often make the error of mistaking appearances (that also may be false) for the real thing or for something else entirely. In the beginning \"the picture explicitly compares the [otherness] of Quasimodo to the righteousness of Frollo\", playing on the stereotype that Quasimodo's deformities make him the monster, while his master Frollo is the man due to his sleeker looks. It is implied by the end of the film, however, that it is now indeed a paradox and reversal of the statement attributed to the two personalities, not by their physical appearances. Singing the reprise of the song, Clopin gives a girl a new riddle: \"What makes a monster and what makes a man?\", stating that Quasimodo is the man because of his humble kindness and selfless bravery, while Frollo is deemed to be the monster because of his selfishness, cruelty, and intolerance.\nThe work Mouse Morality: The Rhetoric of Disney Animated Film by Annalee R. Ward argues that the use of a play-within-a-play technique used in this opening number \"enables the filmmakers to condense some of the story, telling us the setting instead of showing it\". It adds that symbolically, Clopin's puppet show is a metaphor for what Disney has done to the original source material, having \"reduced it to manipulated entertainment, ala 'tragedy lite'\"."

        "content": "The coastline paradox is the counterintuitive observation that the coastline of a landmass does not have a well-defined length.  This results from the fractal curve\u2013like properties of coastlines; i.e., the fact that a coastline typically has a fractal dimension.   Although the \"paradox of length\" was previously noted by Hugo Steinhaus, the first systematic study of this phenomenon was by Lewis Fry Richardson, and it was expanded upon by Benoit Mandelbrot.The measured length of the coastline depends on the method used to measure it and the degree of cartographic generalization. Since a landmass has features at all scales, from hundreds of kilometers in size to tiny fractions of a millimeter and below, there is no obvious size of the smallest feature that should be taken into consideration when measuring, and hence no single well-defined perimeter to the landmass. Various approximations exist when specific assumptions are made about minimum feature size.\nThe problem is fundamentally different from the measurement of other, simpler edges. It is possible, for example, to accurately measure the length of a straight, idealized metal bar by using a measurement device to determine that the length is less than a certain amount and greater than another amount\u2014that is, to measure it within a certain degree of uncertainty. The more precise the measurement device, the closer results will be to the true length of the edge. When measuring a coastline, however, the closer measurement does not result in an increase in accuracy\u2014the measurement only increases in length; unlike with the metal bar, there is no way to obtain an exact value for the length of the coastline.\nIn three-dimensional space, the coastline paradox is readily extended to the concept of fractal surfaces, whereby the area of a surface varies depending on the measurement resolution."

        "content": "Shortly before 1951, Lewis Fry Richardson, in researching the possible effect of border lengths on the probability of war, noticed that the Portuguese reported their measured border with Spain to be 987 km (613 mi), but the Spanish reported it as 1,214 km (754 mi). This was the beginning of the coastline problem, which is a mathematical uncertainty inherent in the measurement of boundaries that are irregular.The prevailing method of estimating the length of a border (or coastline) was to lay out n equal straight-line segments of length l with dividers on a map or aerial photograph. Each end of the segment must be on the boundary. Investigating the discrepancies in border estimation, Richardson discovered what is now termed the \"Richardson effect\": the sum of the segments monotonically increases when the common length of the segments decreases. In effect, the shorter the ruler, the longer the measured border; the Spanish and Portuguese geographers were simply using different-length rulers.\nThe result most astounding to Richardson is that, under certain circumstances, as l approaches zero, the length of the coastline approaches infinity. Richardson had believed, based on Euclidean geometry, that a coastline would approach a fixed length, as do similar estimations of regular geometric figures. For example, the perimeter of a regular polygon inscribed in a circle approaches the circumference with increasing numbers of sides (and decrease in the length of one side). In geometric measure theory such a smooth curve as the circle that can be approximated by small straight segments with a definite limit is termed a rectifiable curve. Benoit Mandelbrot showed that D is independent of \u03b5."

        "content": "The basic concept of length originates from Euclidean distance. In Euclidean geometry, a straight line represents the shortest distance between two points. This line has only one length. On the surface of a sphere, this is replaced by the geodesic length (also called the great circle length), which is measured along the surface curve that exists in the plane containing both endpoints and the center of the sphere. The length of basic curves is more complicated but can also be calculated. Measuring with rulers, one can approximate the length of a curve by adding the sum of the straight lines which connect the points:\n\nUsing a few straight lines to approximate the length of a curve will produce an estimate lower than the true length; when increasingly short (and thus more numerous) lines are used, the sum approaches the curve's true length. A precise value for this length can be found using calculus, the branch of mathematics enabling the calculation of infinitesimally small distances. The following animation illustrates how a smooth curve can be meaningfully assigned a precise length:\n\nNot all curves can be measured in this way. A fractal is, by definition, a curve whose perceived complexity changes with measurement scale. Whereas approximations of a smooth curve tend to a single value as measurement precision increases, the measured value for a fractal does not converge.\n\nAs the length of a fractal curve always diverges to infinity, if one were to measure a coastline with infinite or near-infinite resolution, the length of the infinitely short kinks in the coastline would add up to infinity. However, this figure relies on the assumption that space can be subdivided into infinitesimal sections. The truth value of this assumption\u2014which underlies Euclidean geometry and serves as a useful model in everyday measurement\u2014is a matter of philosophical speculation, and may or may not reflect the changing realities of \"space\" and \"distance\" on the atomic level (approximately the scale of a nanometer).\nCoastlines are less definite in their construction than idealized fractals such as the Mandelbrot set because they are formed by various natural events that create patterns in statistically random ways, whereas idealized fractals are formed through repeated iterations of simple, formulaic sequences."

A school teacher reveals that according to legend, the original name for the village was Xuthltan and the stone was worshiped by pagans at one time (although they probably did not erect it themselves).  The black stone is \"octagonal in shape, some sixteen feet in height and about a foot and a half thick.\"\nA week after arriving the narrator realizes that it is Midsummer Night and makes his way to the stone.  He falls asleep an hour before midnight but wakes to find the chanting and dancing people around the stone. After much dancing, during which the narrator is unable to move or do anything but observe, a baby is killed in sacrifice.  Shortly a giant toad-like monster appears at the top of the stone and a second sacrifice, a young girl, is offered to it.  The narrator faints at this point and decides that it was a dream when he wakes again. But slowly, he realizes that it was no dream. He remembers that Selim Bahadur's case was still with the Count's bones which hadn't been disturbed. The narrator unearths the nobleman's remains and with them, the case belonging to the Turk. He translates the account written by the historian and is horrified by his account of what happened near the Black Stone, how the monstrous creature slaughtered at least ten men before being killed by steel weapons blessed by Muhammad. He realizes that he beheld the cultist worshipers' ghosts bowing before a ghost. He flings the contents of the case into a river."

Tolkien that were never completed during his lifetime, but were edited by his son Christopher Tolkien and published in 1980. Many of the tales within are retold in The Silmarillion, albeit in modified forms; the work also contains a summary of the events of The Lord of the Rings told from a less personal perspective.\nThe collection received a cautious welcome from scholars and critics. They noted Christopher Tolkien's warning that a good knowledge of the background was needed to gain much from the stories. Others noted that the stories were among the best of Tolkien's writing; Warren Dunn expressed a wish for the whole of the history in such a format. The book, with its commentary, was commercially successful, indicating a market for more of Tolkien's work and leading to the 12-volume The History of Middle-earth.\nOn \"The Quest of Erebor\" in Part Three, Christine Barkley comments that the perspective is the knowledgeable Gandalf's, contrasting sharply with the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins's narrower point of view in The Hobbit. Peter Jackson made use of the story to enrich the narrative for his 2013 film The Desolation of Smaug."

        "content": "Unlike The Silmarillion, also published posthumously (in 1977), for which the narrative fragments were modified to connect them into a consistent and coherent work, the Unfinished Tales are presented as Tolkien left them, with little more than names changed (the author having had a confusing habit of trying out different names for a character while writing a draft). Thus some of these are incomplete stories, while others are collections of information about Middle-earth. Each tale is followed by a long series of notes explaining inconsistencies and obscure points.\nAs with The Silmarillion, Tolkien's son Christopher edited and published Unfinished Tales before he had finished his study of the materials in his father's archive. Unfinished Tales provides more detailed information about characters, events and places mentioned only briefly in The Lord of the Rings. Versions of such tales, including the origins of Gandalf and the other Istari (Wizards), the death of Isildur and the loss of the One Ring in the Gladden Fields, and the founding of the kingdom of Rohan, help expand knowledge about Middle-earth.\nThe commercial success of Unfinished Tales demonstrated that the demand for Tolkien's stories several years after his death was not only present but growing. Encouraged by the result, Christopher Tolkien embarked upon the more ambitious twelve-volume work entitled The History of Middle-earth, which encompasses nearly the entire corpus of his father's writings about Middle-earth."

        "content": "The Liturgy of the Eucharist, from the earliest days, was performed behind closed doors out of fear of persecution. One of the earliest explanations of the Eucharist given on behalf of a Christian to the larger contemporary community is given by Justin Martyr in his First Apology to the Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius:\"We call this food Eucharist, and no one else is permitted to partake of it, except one who believes our teaching to be true and who has been washed in the washing which is for the remission of sins and for regeneration [i.e., has received baptism] and is thereby living as Christ enjoined. For not as common bread nor common drink do we receive these; but since Jesus Christ our Savior was made incarnate by the word of God and had both flesh and blood for our salvation, so too, as we have been taught, the food which has been made into the Eucharist by the Eucharistic prayer set down by him, and by the change of which our blood and flesh is nurtured, is both the flesh and the blood of that incarnated Jesus.\" \u2014(First Apology 66 [A.D. 151]).\nIgnatius of Antioch, a disciple of John the Apostle (the author of the gospel of John), first-century Christian writer and Patriarch of Antioch, explains the common understanding of the Eucharist as truly the body and blood of Jesus Christ in a letter written c. 110 AD:\n\nTake note of those who hold heterodox opinions on the grace of Jesus Christ which has come to us, and see how contrary their opinions are to the mind of God\u2026They abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer because they do not confess that the Eucharist is the flesh of our Savior Jesus Christ, flesh which suffered for our sins and which that Father, in his goodness, raised up again. They who deny the gift of God are perishing in their disputes.\nThis orthodox understanding is further affirmed by Irenaeus of Lyon in his famous work \"Against Heresies\" where he asks rhetorically \"If the Lord were from other than the Father, how could he rightly take bread, which is of the same creation as our own, and confess it to be his body and affirm that the mixture in the cup is his blood?\" (Against Heresies 4:32-33).\nCyril of Jerusalem, a fourth-century Christian writer and bishop of Jerusalem during the Arian controversy, explains that \"the bread and the wine of the Eucharist before the holy invocation of the adorable Trinity were simple bread and wine, but the invocation having been made, the bread becomes the body of Christ and the wine the blood of Christ\" (Catechetical Lectures 19:7).\nAugustine of Hippo in his Tractate on John 6 teaches that Jesus was speaking mystically and not carnally (that is, not solely physically): by eating his flesh and drinking his blood the Church not merely be consuming Jesus' body and blood, but would be ritually united with Christ. Augustine elsewhere teaches that the bread and wine is the same body that Jesus gave up and the same blood that he shed on the cross.\n\"I promised you [new Christians], who have now been baptized, a sermon in which I would explain the sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Table\u2026.That bread which you see on the altar, having been sanctified by the word of God, is the body of Christ. That chalice, or rather, what is in that chalice, having been sanctified by the word of God, is the blood of Christ\"\nJohn Chrysostom, in his Homily 47 on the Gospel of John, teaches that Jesus' words are not an enigma or a parable, but to be taken literally."

        "content": "Cornelius a Lapide comments on the words \"comes down\", writing: \"not in the past, but the present tense. The Greek is \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd, the present participle. The expression therefore signifies the perpetual descent of Christ upon the Eucharistic altar even to the end of the world. For whensoever the priest consecrates the Eucharist, Christ, who after His death ascended into heaven, comes down from thence to the consecrated species of bread, and in them declares His presence.\"Friedrich Justus Knecht gives the typical Roman Catholic interpretation of the promises of Jesus in these passages, writing: \"He promised to give us a food, the effects of which would not be passing, but would endure for ever. This Food is Himself: He is the living and life-giving Food which came down from heaven. He promised to give His Flesh for the life of the world, and to offer this His Flesh to be our Food. When the Jews were scandalized at the idea of His giving His Flesh to be eaten, He did not say to them: \"You have misunderstood Me.\" On the contrary, He reaffirmed the very thing which had scandalized them, and asserted repeatedly that His Flesh was meat indeed and His Blood drink indeed, and that those only will have life who eat His Flesh and drink His Blood; though, at the same time, He signified that the Flesh which He would give to be our Food was His glorified Body. When many of His disciples were still offended at the idea of His giving His Flesh to eat, and refused to believe His words, our Lord preferred to let them go, rather than retract or explain away one syllable of the words He had spoken. It is therefore undeniably true that our Lord promised to give His Body, His Flesh and Blood, to be the Food of His servants... Our Lord fulfilled it a year later at the Last Supper.\"Meredith J. C. Warren and Jan Heilmann have challenged the Eucharistic interpretation of this passage. Warren argues that it reflects ancient Mediterranean traditions of sacrificial meals that identify a hero with a divinity.\nHeilmann argues that the imagery of eating the flesh of Jesus and drinking his blood is to be understood against the background of the conceptual metaphor.In the Christological context, the use of the Bread of Life title is similar to the Light of the World title in John 8:12, where Jesus states: \"I am the light of the world: he who follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\" These assertions build on the Christological theme of John 5:26, where Jesus claims to possess life just as the Father does and provides it to those who follow him. The alternative wording, \"bread of God\", appears in John 6:33, but not elsewhere in the New Testament."

It was first published in the 11 January 1818 issue of The Examiner of London.\nThe poem was included the following year in Shelley's collection Rosalind and Helen, A Modern Eclogue; with Other Poems, and in a posthumous compilation of his poems published in 1826.Shelley wrote the poem in friendly competition with his friend and fellow poet Horace Smith (1779\u20131849), who wrote a sonnet on the same topic with the same title. The poem explores the worldly fate of history and the ravages of time: even the greatest men and the empires they forge are impermanent, their legacies fated to decay into oblivion. \"Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!\" exemplifies the arrogance and hubris of a leader who believed his dominion would endure indefinitely."

        "content": "In antiquity, Ozymandias was a Greek name for the pharaoh Ramesses II (r. 1279\u20131213 BC), derived from a part of his throne name, Usermaatre. In 1817, Shelley began writing the poem \"Ozymandias\", after the British Museum acquired the Younger Memnon, a head-and-torso fragment of a statue of Ramesses II, which dated from the 13th century BC. Earlier, in 1816, the Italian archeologist Giovanni Battista Belzoni had removed the 7.25-short-ton (6.58 t; 6,580 kg) statue fragment from the Ramesseum, the mortuary temple of Ramesses II at Thebes, Egypt. The reputation of the statue fragment preceded its arrival to Western Europe; after his Egyptian expedition in 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte had failed to acquire the Younger Memnon for France. Although the British Museum expected delivery of the antiquity in 1818, the Younger Memnon did not arrive in London until 1821.\nShelley published his poems before the statue fragment of Ozymandias arrived in Britain, and the view of modern scholarship is that Shelley never saw the statue, although he might have learned about it from news reports, as it was well known even in its previous location near Luxor.The book Les Ruines, ou m\u00e9ditations sur les r\u00e9volutions des empires (1791) by Constantin Fran\u00e7ois de Chasseb\u0153uf, comte de Volney (1757\u20131820), first published in an English translation as The Ruins, or a Survey of the Revolutions of Empires (London: Joseph Johnson, 1792) by James Marshall, was an influence on Shelley. Shelley had explored similar themes in his 1813 work Queen Mab. Typically, Shelley published his literary works either anonymously or pseudonymously, under the name \"Glirastes\", a Graeco-Latin name created by combining the Latin gl\u012bs (\"dormouse\") with the Greek suffix \u1f10\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 (erast\u0113s, \"lover\"); the Glirastes name referred to his wife, Mary Shelley, whom he nicknamed \"dormouse\"."

In the poem, despite Ozymandias' grandiose ambitions, the power turned out to be ephemeral.\nThe rhyme scheme reflects the interlocking stories of the poem's four narrative voices, which are its \"I\", the \"traveller\" (an exemplar of the sort of travel literature author whose works Shelley would have encountered), the statue's \"architect\", and the statue's subject himself.\nThe \"I met a traveller [who...]\" framing of the poem is an instance of the \"once upon a time\" storytelling device."

An article in Alif cited \"Ozymandias\" as \"one of the greatest and most famous poems in the English language\". Stephens considered that the Ozymandias Shelley created dramatically altered the opinion of Europeans on the king. Donald P. Ryan wrote that \"Ozymandias\" \"stands above\" numerous other poems written about ancient Egypt, particularly its fall and described the sonnet as \"a short, insightful commentary on the fall of power\".\"Ozymandias\" has been included in many poetry anthologies, particularly school textbooks, where it is often included because of its perceived simplicity and the relative ease with which it can be memorized. Percy Bysshe Shelley's 'Ozymandias' serves as a poignant exploration of humanity's insatiable hunger for power and the detrimental consequences that arise from its pursuit. Several poets, including Richard Watson Gilder and John B. Rosenma, have written poems titled \"Ozymandias\" in response to Shelley's work.The influence of the poem can be found in other works, including Wuthering Heights by Emily Bront\u00eb. It has been translated into Russian, where Shelley was an influential figure.In the AMC drama Breaking Bad, the 14th episode of season 5 is titled \"Ozymandias.\" The episode's title alludes to the collapse of protagonist Walter White's drug empire. Bryan Cranston, who portrayed White, read the poem in its entirety in a teaser for final episodes of the series. \nThe media company Ozy was named after the poem, as is the super-powered character Ozymandias in the comic book series Watchmen.Woody Allen used the term Ozymandias Melancholia in his movies Stardust Memories and To Rome with Love.The poem is quoted by the AI character David in Alien: Covenant predicting the decline and demise of the human empire and referenced in the penultimate episode of Succession."

The hero of the story, whose parents have been murdered, grows up to use his peculiar powers to take revenge. The original Skull Man was one of the first antiheroes to be seen in manga, someone who would sacrifice the lives of innocents in his quest for vengeance.\nWhile developing the Kamen Rider (Masked Rider) TV series along with producer Toru Hirayama, Ishinomori created this manga as his own personal version, which the producers at Toei Company Ltd. used as the basis for the show. They made several changes to the content, as Ishinomori's original 100-page one-shot story was too dark and gruesome (even cerebral) for a show for all ages at the time.In the late 1990s, after he had fallen ill, Ishinomori contacted manga artist Kazuhiko Shimamoto to do a remake (ambiguously a continuation) of his original one-shot manga. This remake boasted an extensive, continuing storyline and more complex artwork (along with a tribute to Ishinomori in the final issue, with several of his famous characters gathered together). This was the manga that was presented in the US by Tokyopop. The original 1970 version was digitally released in English by Ishimori Productions in 2012.\nAn animated TV series adaptation, produced by Ishimori Productions and animated by Bones, was broadcast on Fuji TV from April 28, 2007 to July 22, 2007."

        "content": "\"The Wife's Lament\" or \"The Wife's Complaint\" is an Old English poem of 53 lines found on folio 115 of the Exeter Book and generally treated as an elegy in the manner of the German frauenlied, or \"women's song\". The poem has been relatively well preserved and requires few if any emendations to enable an initial reading. Thematically, the poem is primarily concerned with the evocation of the grief of the female speaker and with the representation of her state of despair. The tribulations she suffers leading to her state of lamentation, however, are cryptically described and have been subject to many interpretations. Indeed, Professor Stephen Ramsay has said, \"the 'correct' interpretation of \"The Wife's Lament\" is one of the more hotly debated subjects in medieval studies.\""

        "content": "Though the description of the text as a woman's song or frauenlied\u2014lamenting for a lost or absent lover\u2014is the dominant understanding of the poem, the text has nevertheless been subject to a variety of distinct treatments that fundamentally disagree with this view and propose alternatives. One such treatment considers the poem to be allegory, in which interpretation the lamenting speaker represents the Church as Bride of Christ or as an otherwise feminine allegorical figure. Another dissenting interpretation holds that the speaker, who describes herself held within an old earth cell (eald is \u00fees eor\u00f0sele) beneath an oak tree (under actreo), may indeed literally be located in a cell under the earth, and would therefore constitute a voice of the deceased, speaking from beyond the grave. Both the interpretations, as with most alternatives, face difficulties, particularly in the latter case, for which no analogous texts exist in the Old English corpus.\nThe status of the poem as a lament spoken by a female protagonist is therefore fairly well established in criticism. Interpretations that attempt a treatment diverging from this, though diverse in their approach, bear a fairly heavy burden of proof. Thematic consistencies between the Wife's Lament and its close relative in the genre of the woman's song, as well as close neighbour in the Exeter Book, Wulf and Eadwacer, make unconventional treatments somewhat counterintuitive. A final point of divergence, however, between the conventional interpretation and variants proceeds from the similarity of the poem in some respects to elegiac poems in the Old English corpus that feature male protagonists. Similarities between the language and circumstances of the male protagonist of The Wanderer, for example, and the protagonist of the Wife's Lament have led other critics to argue, even more radically, that the protagonist of the poem (to which the attribution of the title \"the wife's lament\" is wholly apocryphal and fairly recent) may in fact be male. This interpretation, however, faces the almost insurmountable problem that adjectives and personal nouns occurring within the poem (geomorre, minre, sylfre) are feminine in grammatical gender. This interpretation is at the very least dependent therefore on a contention that perhaps a later Anglo-Saxon copyist has wrongly imposed feminine gender on the protagonist where this was not the original authorial intent, and such contentions almost wholly relegate discussion to the realm of the hypothetical. It is also thought by some that The Wife's Lament and The Husband's Message may be part of a larger work.The poem is also considered by some to be a riddle poem.  A riddle poem contains a lesson told in cultural context which would be understandable or relates to the reader, and was a very popular genre of poetry of the time period.  Gnomic wisdom is also a characteristic of a riddle poem, and is present in the poem's closing sentiment (lines 52-53). Also, it cannot be ignored that contained within the Exeter Book are 92 other riddle poems.  According to Faye Walker-Pelkey, \"The Lament's placement in the Exeter Book, its mysterious content, its fragmented structure, its similarities to riddles, and its inclusion of gnomic wisdom suggest that the \"elegy\"...is a riddle.\""

        "content": "Interpreting the text of the poem as a woman's lament, many of the text's central controversies bear a similarity to those around Wulf and Eadwacer. Although it is unclear whether the protagonist's tribulations proceed from relationships with multiple lovers or a single man, Stanley B. Greenfield, in his paper \"The Wife's Lament Reconsidered,\" discredits the claim that the poem involves multiple lovers. He suggests that lines 42-47 use an optative voice as a curse against the husband, not a second lover. The impersonal expressions with which the poem concludes, according to Greenfield, do not represent gnomic wisdom or even a curse upon young men in general; rather this impersonal voice is used to convey the complex emotions of the wife toward her husband.Virtually all of the facts integral to the poem beyond the matter of genre are widely open to dispute. The obscurity of the narrative background of the story has led some critics to suggest that the narrative may have been one familiar to its original listeners, at some point when this particular rendition was conceived, such that much of the matter of the story was omitted in favour of a focus on the emotional drive of the lament. Constructing a coherent narrative from the text requires a good deal of inferential conjecture, but a commentary on various elements of the text is provided here nonetheless.\nThe Wife's Lament, even more so than Wulf and Eadwacer, vividly conflates the theme of mourning over a departed or deceased leader of the people (as may be found in The Wanderer) with the theme of mourning over a departed or deceased lover (as portrayed in Wulf and Eadwacer). The lord of the speaker's people (min leodfruma, min hlaford) appears in all likelihood also to be her lord in marriage. Given that her lord's kinsmen (\u00fe\u00e6t monnes magas) are described as taking measures to separate the speaker from him, a probable interpretation of the speaker's initial circumstances is that she has been entered into an exogamous relationship typical within the Anglo-Saxon heroic tradition, and her marital status has left her isolated among her husband's people, who are hostile to her, whether due to her actions or merely due to political strife beyond her control.  Somewhat confusing the account, however, the speaker, longing for her lover, has apparently departed (Ic me feran ge\u01bfat) either to seek out her lord or merely to seek exile, and the relationship, chronologically or causally, between this act and the hostility of her and/or her husband's people is unclear.\nShe is told by her lord (hlaford min) to take up a particular dwelling place, where she encounters a man of unclear identity, who is or was \"suitable\" (ful gem\u00e6cne) to her, and they declare they will not be separated by anything save death. This, however, does not last, seemingly as a consequence of prior difficulties concerning her marriage. The remainder of the narrative concerns her lamentable state in the present of the poem. She is commanded to dwell in a barrow within the earth (\u00fees eor\u00f0sele), wherein she is compelled to mourn the loss of her lord and her present exile. The poem concludes with what begins as a gnomic exhortation admonishing youth to adopt a cheerful aspect, even in grief, but subsequently develops into an expression of the grief of the speaker's beloved.\nMore recent interpretations have disputed this gnomic exhortation. According to John Niles, in this \u201cgenteel\u201d reading, it seems less consequential whether the wife has been scorned by one husband or two; it is her \u201cdignified passivity\u201d as well as her gnomic wisdom on which scholars focus. In \u201cvindictive\u201d readings, however, the wife is generally seen to burn with anger toward one man \u2013 her husband. In such views, The Wife\u2019s Lament begins as a bold statement of misery, transitions into a description of her misfortunes in which she nostalgically recalls happy days with her husband, and ends in a bitter curse upon this same man who has now abandoned her.One proponent of this approach is Barrie Ruth Straus, author of \u201cWomen\u2019s Words as Weapons: Speech as Action in \u2018The Wife\u2019s Lament.\u2019\u201d Straus bases her analysis of the poem on the speech act theory of J.L. Austin and John Searle, which regards speech as an action. Strauss breaks the poem into sections and shows how the language or \u201cillocutionary acts\u201d of each can be seen as an assertive act of telling. In a world in which women have little control, Straus emphasizes how speech could be an act of power; thus in the first section, the narrator deliberately establishes an intent to tell her story. She then persuasively presents her story as one of being wronged by her husband, avenging herself in the telling. In light of this speech act theory, Straus concludes that the final ten lines of the poem should be construed as a curse upon the husband, as this is the \u201cleast problematic interpretation\u201d.Like Straus, Niles views the poem as an aggressive act of speech. While arguing that the poem presents certain philological evidence to support an optative reading, the bulk of his support comes from contextual analysis of the act of cursing within the Anglo-Saxon culture. His article, \u201cThe Problem of the Ending of the Wife\u2019s \u2018Lament\u2019 \u201d provides an intriguing overview of curses, discussing biblical influences of cursing as seen in Psalms 108 and the book of Deuteronomy. He also examines the act of cursing in charters and wills, quoting examples such as the following: \u201cIf anyone ever alters or removes anything in this will, may God\u2019s grace and his eternal reward be taken from him forever\u2026\u201d. The Exeter Book itself is inscribed with such a curse. The Anglo-Saxon culture that took all acts of \u01bfearg-c\u01bfedol (evil speaking) very seriously and even warily watched for potential witches, Niles argues, would have little trouble accepting the poem as a curse. Whether intended as a formal malediction or an emotional vituperation is less important."

        "content": "Delos David \"D. D.\" Harriman, \"the last of the Robber Barons\", is obsessed with being the first to travel to\u2014and possess\u2014the Moon. He asks his business partner, George Strong, and other tycoons to invest in the venture. Most dismiss Harriman's plans as foolhardy: Nuclear rocket fuel is scarce as the space station that produces it blew up, also destroying the only existing spaceship. The necessary technology for a chemical-fueled rocket stretches the boundaries of current engineering. The endeavor is both incredibly costly and of uncertain profitability. One skeptic offers to sell \"all of my interest in the Moon...for fifty cents\"; Harriman accepts and tries to buy the other associates' interests as well. Strong and two others agree to back his plans.\nThe technical problems are solvable with money and talent. To solve the tougher financial problems, Harriman exploits commercial and political rivalries. He implies to the Moka-Coka company, for example, that rival soft drink maker 6+ plans to turn the Moon into a massive billboard, using a rocket to scatter black dust on the surface in patterns. To an anti-Communist associate, he suggests that the Russians may print the hammer and sickle across the face of the Moon if they get to it first. To a television network, he offers the Moon as a reliable and uncensorable broadcasting station.\nHarriman seeks to avoid government ownership of the Moon. As it passes directly overhead only in a narrow band north and south of the equator, he uses a legal principle that states that property rights extend to infinity above a land parcel. On that basis, Mexico, Central and parts of South America, and other countries in those latitudes around the world, have a claim on the Moon. The United States also has a claim due to Florida and Texas. By arranging for many countries to assert their rights Harriman persuades the United Nations to, as a compromise, assign management of the Moon to his company.\nMoney remains the main difficulty. Harriman liquidates his assets, risks bankruptcy, damages his marriage, and raises funds in numerous legitimate and semi-legitimate ways; \"I\", he says, \"would cheat, lie, steal, beg, bribe\u2014do anything to accomplish what we have accomplished\". Children donate money for a promise of all contributors' names engraved on a plaque left on the Moon. The names, however, will be microscopic in size. Harriman sells land and naming rights to craters, and plans to sell postal covers canceled on the Moon to collectors. He starts rumors that diamonds exist in moondust, intending to secretly place gems in the rocket to convince people that the rumors are true. Harriman will strenuously deny that the diamonds are from the Moon, being merely part of a scientific experiment; he expects people not to believe him, but he will not be guilty of actual fraud.\nHarriman wants to be on the first flight of the Pioneer but the ship only has room for one pilot, Leslie LeCroix. The multistage rocket launches from Peterson Field, near Colorado Springs, Colorado, lands on the Moon, and returns to Earth. Harriman is the first to open the rocket's hatch; the canceled postal covers were left behind to save weight and he needs to get them aboard surreptitiously. While doing so, he asks LeCroix for the \"lunar\" diamonds. The pilot complies, then produces real lunar diamonds as well.\nAs Harriman predicted, once the first flight succeeds, many seek to invest in his venture to make more flights using a catapult launcher built on Pikes Peak. The next flight will begin a lunar colony. Harriman intends to be on the ship, but the majority owners of the venture object to his presence on the flight; he is too valuable to the company to risk in space. The rocket leaves without Harriman, who \"looks as Moses must have looked, when he gazed out over the promised land\"."

However, the technology of The Man Who Sold the Moon is very different: its rocket is multi-staged, while Destination Moon uses a single-stage-to-orbit spaceship that takes off and lands vertically, both on Earth and the Moon. (Dialogue in the film makes it very clear that the spaceship is nuclear powered.)\nThe novella also inspired David Bowie's 1970 song \"The Man Who Sold the World\", in both its title and its central themes."

It follows Nanaki Koga, a young man who wakes up from a two-year coma to learn that cross-dressing has become very popular among men while he was unconscious, and that the students and teachers in his all-male school now dress like women.\nShinagawa wrote the series with a focus on what he considered the major points of appeal in cross-dressing stories, including Nanaki's motivation for starting to wear women's clothes, how it turns habitual, and his behavior while dressed up. The series was among the most popular in the magazine during its serialization and sold well digitally, and was well received for its characters."

Shinagawa thought that these aspects, and the ways in which they can vary between characters, were the main points of appeal of stories about cross-dressing, and described them as what he personally enjoyed reading about in cross-dressing stories. He described the premise of Crossdressing Pandemic as cute, albeit not particularly deep. Funbo, another creator of cross-dressing manga, contributed a guest page for the second volume."

        "content": "\"Big Two-Hearted River\" is a two-part short story written by American author Ernest Hemingway, published in the 1925 Boni & Liveright edition of  In Our Time, the first American volume of Hemingway's short stories.  It features a single protagonist, Hemingway's recurrent autobiographical character Nick Adams, whose speaking voice is heard just three times. The story explores the destructive qualities of war which is countered by the healing and regenerative powers of nature. When it was published, critics praised Hemingway's sparse writing style and it became an important work in his canon.\nThe story is one of Hemingway's earliest pieces to employ his Iceberg Theory of writing; a modernist approach to prose in which the underlying meaning is hinted at, rather than explicitly stated. \"Big Two-Hearted River\" is almost exclusively descriptive and intentionally devoid of plot. Hemingway was influenced by the visual innovations of C\u00e9zanne's paintings and adapted the painter's idea of presenting background minutiae in lower focus than the main image. In this story, the small details of a fishing trip are explored in great depth, while the landscape setting, and most obviously the swamp, are given cursory attention."

        "content": "In 1922, Hemingway moved with his wife Hadley to Paris, where he worked as foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star.  He became friends with and was influenced by modernist writers such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ford Madox Ford, James Joyce, Ezra Pound and Gertrude Stein. The year 1923 saw his first published work, a slim volume titled Three Stories and Ten Poems, followed the next year by another collection of short vignettes, in our time (without capitals).  Hoping to have in our time published in New York, in 1924 he began writing stories to add to the volume with \"Big Two-Hearted River\" planned as the final piece. He started writing the story in May of that year but did not finish until September as he spent the summer helping Ezra Pound and Ford Madox Ford launch the journal the transatlantic review.\n\"Big Two-Hearted River\" has strong autobiographical elements. During World War I, Hemingway signed on as a member of the Red Cross at age 19,  and was sent to the Italian Front at Fossalta as an ambulance driver. On his first day there, he helped to retrieve the remains of female workers killed in a munitions factory explosion, about which he later wrote in Death in the Afternoon: \"I remember that after we searched quite thoroughly for the complete dead we collected fragments\". A few days later, on July 8, 1918, he was severely wounded when a mortar bomb exploded between his legs. He was sent to a hospital in Milan where he recuperated for six months; after his return home, he went on a week-long fishing and camping trip in September 1919 with two high school friends to the backcountry near Seney in Michigan's Upper Peninsula\u2014a trip that became the inspiration for \"Big Two-Hearted River\". The manuscript shows the use of plural pronouns, suggesting that in an early version more characters were included, but by publication any mention of his friends or the townspeople had been removed\u2014leaving Nick alone in the woods.Hemingway gave the draft to Stein to read in October 1925; she advised cutting the 11-page section of stream-of-consciousness reminiscences written from Nick's point of view. Hemingway took her advice, reworked the ending, and wrote to his editor: \"I have discovered that the last eleven pages of the last story in the book are crap\". Biographer James Mellow writes that at this early stage in his career Hemingway had not developed his talent enough to fully and capably integrate self-reflections in his writing; Mellow also believes the deleted passage might have been a \"tour-de-force\" had it been written at a more mature period in Hemingway's development.In January 1925, while wintering in Schruns, Austria, waiting for a response from query letters written to friends and publishers in America, Hemingway submitted the story to be published in his friend Ernest Walsh's newly established literary magazine This Quarter. Walsh bought it for 1,000 French francs, the highest payment Hemingway had yet received for a piece of fiction. On October 5, 1925, the expanded edition of In Our Time (with conventional capitalization in the title) was published by Boni & Liveright in New York. The last story in the volume was the two-part \"Big Two-Hearted River\". The piece was later included in Hemingway's collection The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories published in October 1938, and in two collections of short stories published after his death, The Nick Adams Stories (1972) and The Complete Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway: The Finca Vig\u00eda Edition (1987). The fragment Hemingway cut was published posthumously as a separate short story titled \"On Writing\" in 1972 in The Nick Adams Stories."

After, he hikes up a hill and rests at a burned stump. While smoking a cigarette, he discovers an ash-blackened grasshopper crawling on his sock, and detaches it. His first spoken words in the story are \"Go on, hopper .... Fly away somewhere.\"Later in the day he relaxes in a glade of tall pines and falls asleep. When he wakes, he hikes the last mile to the edge of the river where he sees the trout feeding in the evening light \"making circles all down the surface of the water as though it were starting to rain.\" He pitches his tent, unpacks his supplies, cooks his dinner, fills his water bucket, heats a pot of coffee, and kills a mosquito before falling asleep.\nPart two\nEarly the next morning, Nick fills a jar with 50 dew-heavy grasshoppers found under a log he names a \"grasshopper lodging-house\", eats breakfast, drinks sweetened coffee and makes a sliced onion sandwich. After checking and assembling his fly fishing rod and tying on damp leader line, he walks to the river with a net hanging from his belt, a sack over his shoulder and the jar of grasshoppers dangling around his neck. Wading in the water, he fishes the shallows; he lands a trout that \"was mottled with clear, water-over-gravel color\" that he releases. Moving into a pool of deeper water, he hooks a large trout, \"as broad as a salmon\", which he loses. After a rest, he moves away from the pool to the more shallow center of the river and catches two trout that he stows in his sack. Sitting on a log, smoking a cigarette and eating his onion sandwich, he thinks about fishing the deep water of the swamp, but decides to wait for another day. At the log in the river, he kills, guts and cleans the two trout before returning to camp."

The work was well received by critics; Edmund Wilson described the writing as \"of the first distinction\", and in the 1940s he again wrote of \"Big Two-Hearted River\", \"along with the mottled trout ... the boy from the American Middle West fishes up a nice little masterpiece.\" When the story was published in the United States, critics asserted Hemingway had reinvigorated the short story by his use of declarative sentences and his crisp style.  In 1952, reviewing The Old Man and the Sea\u2014for which Hemingway would win the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize in Literature\u2014The New York Times said of \"Big Two-Hearted River\" that it was one of the \"best and happiest of his early short stories\".Carlos Baker views the stories of In Our Time as a remarkable achievement for a young writer. Joseph Flora described \"Big Two-Hearted River\" as \"unquestionably the most brilliant of the collection In Our Time\". The piece has become one of Hemingway's most anthologized stories, and one of a handful subject to serious literary criticism since its publication, and belongs in the canon of 20th-century American literature. Beegel writes that it is considered \"among the best\" American short stories, along with Stephen Crane's \"The Open Boat\", Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"Young Goodman Brown\" and Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Fall of the House of Usher\".According to Benson, despite Pound and Joyce's influence, Hemingway \"carried the new form into the position of dominant influence\" for much of the 20th century. Unlike other modernist writers, who wrote of man cut off from the past, Hemingway placed his narratives in the present and hence became \"the true modernist\"."

Its chapters were collected in 77 tank\u014dbon volumes. Set in Edo, which has been conquered by aliens named Amanto, the plot follows samurai Gintoki Sakata, who works as a freelancer in his self-established store, \"Yorozuya\", alongside his friends Shinpachi Shimura and Kagura, offering a wide range of services to handle various tasks and odd jobs. Sorachi added the science fiction setting to develop characters to his liking after his editor suggested doing a historical series.\nThe series has been adapted into an original video animation (OVA) by Sunrise and was featured at Jump Festa 2006 Anime Tour in 2005. This was followed by a full 367-episode anime television series, which debuted in April 2006 on TV Tokyo, and finished in October 2018. Three animated films have been produced. The first film premiered in April 2010. The second film premiered in July 2013. The third and final film premiered in January 2021. Besides the anime series, there have been various light novels and video games based on Gintama. A live-action film adaptation of the same name was released in July 2017 in Japan by Warner Bros. Pictures.\nThe manga has been licensed by Viz Media in North America. In addition to publishing the individual volumes of the series, Viz serialized its first chapters in their Shonen Jump manga anthology. It debuted in the January 2007 issue and was serialized at a rate of one chapter a month. Sentai Filmworks initially licensed the series. The website Crunchyroll purchased the anime's streaming rights and home video rights.\nIn Japan, the Gintama manga has been popular, with over 58 million copies in circulation by December 2023, making it one of the best-selling manga series.

        "content": "The story is set in an alternate-history late-Edo period, where humanity is attacked by aliens called \"Amanto\" (\u5929\u4eba, \"Sky People\"). Edo Japan's samurai fight to defend Earth, but the shogun cowardly surrenders when he realizes the aliens' power. He agrees to an unequal contract with the aliens, placing a ban on carrying swords in public and allowing the invaders to enter the country. The samurai's swords are confiscated and the Tokugawa bakufu (shogunate) becomes a puppet government.\nThe series focuses on an eccentric samurai, Gintoki Sakata who works as an odd-jobs freelancer. He helps a teenager named Shinpachi Shimura save his sister Tae from an alien group that wants to send her to a brothel. Impressed by Gintoki, Shinpachi becomes his freelance apprentice to pay the bills and learn more about the enigmatic samurai. When the pair rescues a teenage alien girl with super-strength, Kagura, from a Yakuza group, they accept her into their odd-jobs freelancing business, and the three become known as \"Yorozuya\" (\u4e07\u4e8b\u5c4b, 'Store of 10,000 business' or 'We do everything').\nWhile working, they regularly encounter the Shinsengumi police force, who often ally with Gintoki when work involves dangerous criminals. The trio also meets Gintoki's former comrades from the Amanto invasion, including the revolutionary Kotaro Katsura who is friendly toward them despite his terrorist activities against the alien-controlled government.\nThe story is a balance between episodic and shorter arc based plotlines that resolve quickly, and a rich background plot that develops from its beginning to end. For example, Gintoki's former comrade Shinsuke Takasugi is a major antagonist who regards Gintoki and his other former comrades as enemies and seeks to destroy the shogunate. Over time, Takasugi gains allies, including Kagura's brother Kamui, and the elite fighting unit Mimawarigumi to prepare for his large-scale coup d'\u00e9tat. After the true antagonist\u2014the immortal Utsuro\u2014is introduced, Gintoki works with both friends and enemies to stop Utsuro from destroying the Earth."

        "content": "Hideaki Sorachi's main focus in Gintama is the use of gags; during the manga's second year of serialization, he started to add more drama to the story while still keeping the comedy. Various jokes from the manga are comments regarding elements from other manga series. For example, in the first chapter, after Gintoki fights a group of aliens to protect Shinpachi and Tae, Shinpachi complains that he only fought for \"one page\" and Gintoki replies, \"Shut up! One page is a long time for a manga artist!\" Gintoki's exaggerated desire to read the Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump (which causes him to fight other readers to get it) also makes fun of sh\u014dnen series, since during those parts characters quote them. Other types of comedic situations are more general so that the reader must know about Japanese culture to understand them. The humor is described by publications as being \"bizarre\" and \"weird\". It is also described as being divided between two categories: \"sci-fi comedy\" and a \"samurai comedy\" with the former referring to the aliens. It tends to point out \"an irritating foible about modern society\" including celebration days or famous mythical figures. Additionally, there are references to several historical figures with a few characters from the story being based on them. Besides the series' comedy, the aliens' invasion of Japan brings several social issues between them and the humans with the most recurring one being the lack of social equality. As a result, one of the main themes involves society trying to preserve their way of living rather than fulfilling a dream like in other sh\u014dnen series."

        "content": "In 2003, Hideaki Sorachi was an up-and-coming manga artist who had already created two one-shots for the Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump magazine. Although he was preparing to write his first serialized series, his editor suggested he create a manga series based on the Shinsengumi, mostly inspired by an upcoming TV drama about the 1860s troupe as depicted by idol actors. Sorachi attempted to create this series since he admitted to liking the Shinsengumi but ultimately failed to get anything off the ground. Instead of abandoning the idea completely, he remained focused on the historical Japanese era but began to create his own story, adding in elements of science fiction and fictionalizing many of the figures from the era to create a story more to his liking. The original title of the series was meant to be \"Yorozuya Gin-san\" (\u4e07\u4e8b\u5c4b\u9280\u3055\u3093, lit. \"Odd Jobs Gin-san\"), but it did not have any impact on Sorachi. After a great debate, he decided to go with the name Gintama after discussing it with his family, deciding on a name that sounded close to the edge without being completely off it. Although Sorachi considered the one-shot \"Samuraider\" to be very poor, the setting of one-shot served as the base for Gintama such as the addition of alien characters. Sorachi liked the Bakumatsu and Sengoku periods due to how both were eras of change and thus presented the positive and negative points of humanity. The series was then set in an alternate Bakumatsu to give a bigger significance to the characters' bushido as in that time samurais were at the low point of their lives. Sorachi also cited the manga series Rurouni Kenshin (1994\u20131999), set during the Bakumatsu and Meiji periods, as a major source of inspiration.The main character of the series was originally meant to be Toshiro Hijikata as Sorachi was a fan of the Shinsengumi, most notably from Hijikata Toshiz\u014d (the Shinsengumi who was the base for the one of Gintama) after he saw the film Burn! Sword!. When Sorachi could not \"shake off\" Hijikata's initial design, he decided not to use him as the lead character but added him along with the Shinsengumi to the story. The pilot chapter from the series had a different plot to the one from the serialization: Shinpachi already met Gintoki in the story and there were more Shinsengumi to the story such as one based on Harada Sanosuke. As all these new Shinsengumi were older than most of the recurring characters from the series, Sorachi removed them thinking they were not entertaining. When asked by a fan, Sorachi mentioned that most characters from the series are based on real-life Edo citizens while Gintoki's character is roughly based on the folk hero Sakata no Kintoki.When starting serialization the manga was unpopular and was close to being canceled. Although Sorachi was pleased with the first tank\u014dbon selling all of its copies, he later learned Shueisha was afraid of poor sales which resulted in the minimum printed. To increase its popularity, the author introduced new characters, the Shinsengumi, who felt memorable to his assistants. Sorachi had little hope on the manga's popularity, as he noted that people used to tell him the manga would not surpass the number of two tank\u014dbon volumes. However, once the third volume was released, Sorachi found that he did not have \"any fresh material to use.\" During the first year of the series, Sorachi believed that the source of the popularity of Gintama was partially connected to the Shinsengumi drama. While the drama ran during the first year of the series, when the manga was mostly shorter stories that established the characters and the world, he felt uncomfortable making things related to the drama. By the second year and beyond, he became more daring in his stories and concepts, creating longer storylines that included more drama while keeping his sense of humor and satirization of modern Japan by way of his fictionalized past.When working on a chapter of Gintama, Sorachi sometimes had problems finishing the manuscript, leaving his supervisor to take it before he can revise it. He figured out what to write by staying in his room or going for a walk. Although he commented that some of his ideas are \"random,\" he focused on the fact that they are all related to the manga, and when he had problems coming up with ideas, Sorachi was often helped by his editor. Thinking of Gintama as a \"non-sense manga,\" before writing a chapter, Sorachi decided whether it should be a comedy or a drama. Sorachi defined Gintama as a \"science fiction human drama pseudo-historical comedy.\"When Sorachi illustrated Gintama, he usually used a felt-tip pen, a fountain pen, a brush-tip pen, and a multiliner, but for the major characters, he only used a felt-tip pen and a fountain pen and did their outlines with a multiliner-0.8."

The story was first published in 1947 in the literary magazine Los Anales de Buenos Aires and republished in Borges's short story collection The Aleph in 1949. It is based on the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur and is told from the perspective of Asterion, the Minotaur.\nOne of Borges's shortest stories, it was written over a period of two days and received generally positive reviews from contemporary critics and authors. The story explores themes of death, redemption, and the nature of monstrosity. Its narrative style has been referred to as a \"literary puzzle\", with the narrator's identity not fully revealed until the end of the story. Literary critic Gene H. Bell-Villada noted that \"there is no instance of a major author so inverting the hero\u2013monster relationship\" prior to \"The House of Asterion\"."

He describes his house in detail: that it has no locked doors; that it has many corridors and rooms, pools, and courtyards. He explains his hermetic ways by recounting how once, when he left his house, the commoners were so agitated that he now does not go out, believing that, as a child of a queen, his royal blood sets him apart. Asterion explains how he spends his days in solitude: running through the corridors; pretending to sleep; and sometimes pretending that \"the other Asterion\" has come to visit, and giving him a tour of the house.\nAsterion goes into detail about the infinitude of his house, comparing it to the universe. He also suggests that perhaps he created the world and has forgotten about it. Finally, he makes mention of other people: nine men who come every nine years \"so that I may deliver them from all evil\", and whose bodies he leaves in the empty rooms to distinguish one room from another. Asterion speculates about his own death, and eagerly awaits the coming of his \"redeemer\", who will take him away from his infinite house.\nThe story ends with a line from Theseus\u2014\"Would you believe it, Ariadne? The Minotaur scarcely defended himself.\"\u2014revealing that Asterion, who is indeed the Cretan Minotaur, has been slain."

        "content": "In the epilogue to his 1949 short-story collection The Aleph, Borges wrote that the inspiration for \"The House of Asterion\" and the \"character of its sad protagonist\" was The Minotaur, a painting completed in 1885 by English artist George Frederic Watts. The painting depicts the mythological Minotaur as a solitary and seemingly lonely creature, leaning on a parapet and staring longingly at the sea while gripping a crushed bird in his hand.Borges's composition of \"The House of Asterion\" and other short stories in The Aleph coincided with his turbulent relationship with Argentine writer Estela Canto. Borges first met Canto in 1944 and proposed to her only a year later; but their relationship ended in July 1946 after Canto came to resent Borges's mother, whom she found to be overly controlling of him. Edwin Williamson, one of Borges's biographers, wrote that Canto's desertion of Borges and his subsequent unhappiness influenced elements of  \"The House of Asterion\", including the title character's extreme loneliness and desire to be liberated from his monotonous existence.\nAccording to Norman Thomas di Giovanni, an editor and translator who frequently collaborated with Borges, \"The House of Asterion\" was written over a period of two days in 1947, after Borges discovered that he had two blank pages to fill in Los Anales de Buenos Aires, the literary magazine he edited. Modern analyses of Borges's original handwritten manuscript, which is kept at the University of Virginia, have revealed the revisions he made to earlier drafts of the work in order to more effectively disguise the narrator's identity in the story's beginning. For instance, Borges replaced the phrase \"los griegos\" (the Greeks) with \"los hombres\" (the men) in the third sentence, removing a potential intimation of Greek mythology. Analyses of Borges's revisions have also suggested that, while writing the story, he experimented with various framings of the reveal of Asterion's identity, deliberating on whether to explicitly name the Minotaur's labyrinth and to mention the nature of Theseus's weapon.The original Spanish-language version of \"The House of Asterion\" was published in print in the May\u2013June 1947 edition of Los Anales de Buenos Aires. It was accompanied by an illustration, by Austrian artist Marie Elisabeth Wrede, depicting Asterion slumped on the ground with his head covered by a shroud, as Theseus stands over him, sword in hand. The story would later be included, alongside twelve other short stories by Borges, in The Aleph, first published by Editorial Losada in June 1949. It was translated into English by James Irby and Donald Yates in their 1962 collection Labyrinths, and by Di Giovanni (in collaboration with Borges) in 1970."

Novelist Julio Cort\u00e1zar complimented Asterion's characterization in a letter to Borges, writing: \"[L]o encuentro pleno de admirable inteligencia\" (\"I find him full of admirable intelligence\"). In a review for the literary magazine Sur, Argentine writer Estela Canto, who had recently ended her relationship with Borges, praised the story for its \"infinita riqueza\" (infinite richness) and use of symbolism.

        "content": "While in New Orleans, Kirby Buckner is confronted by an elderly Creole woman who whispers a bizarre warning: \"Trouble on Tularoosa Creek!\" The woman quickly disappears into a nearby crowd. Buckner immediately realizes that his backwoods homeland is in peril and instantly departs for the Canaan region of his birth. He arrives after midnight and heads out on horseback through the bayou, before reaching the town of Grimesville. En route, he encounters a mysterious \"quadroon girl\" who mocks him. Buckner is disturbed to find himself aroused by her provocative beauty. The woman calls forth several large black men from hiding to kill Buckner, but he shoots one and kills another with a thrown bowie knife. As the third flees, he notices that the girl has vanished.\nBuckner joins his fellow white men, but finds himself strangely reluctant to speak about the black woman. He learns how the local blacks are now being led by a strange \"conjure man\" named Saul Stark, who has vowed to kill all the whites in Grimesville and set up a black empire in America. Most are apprehensive concerning the imminent \"uprising\". The scion of an important family, Buckner is looked to for leadership during this time of crisis.\nThe men of Grimesville had already captured a frightened black man, Tope Sorely, and were about to interrogate him when Buckner arrived. One of the men offers a whip for use as coercion but Buckner, against beating the truth from Tope, attempts to calm him instead. Tope is afraid of Stark's wrath should he betray his own master. He fears that Stark will use his magical powers to \"put me in de swamp!\" Promises of protection persuade Tope to tell them of Stark's ambitions. However, Buckner decides to confront Stark himself. Traveling to Stark's cabin, Buckner finds Stark has left, but instinctively realizes that he placed some sort of supernatural entity within the cabin to guard it and does not enter. As he returns to his fellow townspeople, Buckner once again meets the quadroon girl. \"I have made a charm you cannot resist!\" she gloats, and deep down Kirby knows this is true. The women tells him about how, on this very night, she will summon Kirby to her and they'll witness the Dance of the Skull, where he'll be left powerless to resist.\nThe witch woman melts mysteriously into the swamp and Buckner rides away. Along the trail, Buckner meets Jim Braxton, a friend who has come searching for him.  Buckner admonishes Braxton about returning to Grimesville, so he can find and face Stark alone. However, Braxton refuses to allow his friend to face this danger on his own. As the sun sets, Buckner feels himself drawn towards the black settlement of Goshen, unable to resist or even speak of the witch's spell to Braxton. He attempts to warn his friend away several times, but to no avail.  Arriving at Goshen, both men encounter the witch woman. Buckner is paralyzed by the spell, but Braxton acts out and shoots at her. Once more she vanishes, and they find no body. Suddenly, they're attacked by something in the swamp, which they cannot see clearly, and Jim Braxton is killed. Buckner, totally helpless in the grip of a voodoo spell, finds himself watching the rites of Damballah from a grove of trees. The orgiastic rites will climax with Buckner meeting a hideous fate at the hands of Saul Stark. Just then, amid a circle of Stark's followers, the witch appears, her body swaying rhythmically in the Dance of the Skull. Buckner realizes that she is the source of Stark's power, and, at the end of the ceremony, Stark will fully consolidate his power over the black people of the region.\nHowever, as the witch finishes her dance she collapses, dead, for Braxton's bullet had struck home, hitting her in the heart. Only her supernatural power had kept her alive this long. As she expires, Buckner feels the spell laid upon him lift. The black people flee in panic, their uprising haulted, as Buckner stalks out of the swamp and kills Stark. Afterwards, Buckner learns  the meaning of Tope Sorley's cryptic words: \"He'd put me in de swamp!\" He discovers that Stark magically altered the appearance of his enemies, transforming them into mindless amphibian horrors.  The burden of this terrible knowledge is a secret Buckner does not share with his fellow whites, creating an unspoken bond between himself and the black people of Canaan."

        "content": "\"Black Canaan\" was inspired by the legend of Kelly the Conjure-man.  In late 1930, Howard wrote a long letter to H. P. Lovecraft concerning the history and lore of the South and Southwest.  He mentions the Scotch-Irish settlement of Holly Springs, Arkansas, where his grandfather, William Benjamin Howard, settled in 1858. After recounting some of the local history, Howard goes on to write:\n\nProbably the most picturesque figure in the Holly Springs country was Kelly the 'conjer man', who held sway among the black population of the `70s.  Son of a Congo ju-ju man was Kelly, and he dwelt apart from his race in silent majesty on the river... He lifted 'conjers' and healed disease by incantation and nameless things made of herbs and ground snake bones... Later he began to branch into darker practices... [T]he black population came to fear him as they did not fear the Devil, and Kelly assumed more and more a brooding, satanic aspect of dark majesty and sinister power; when he began casting his brooding eyes on white folks as if their souls, too, were his to dandle in the hollow of his hand, he sealed his doom...They began to fear the conjure man and one night he vanished...\nIn Howard's following letter to Lovecraft, he responds to the latter's suggestion that he make use of Kelly in his fiction; \"Kelly the conjure-man was quite a character, but I fear I could not do justice to such a theme as you describe.\"  However, despite Howard's reticence, Kelly did begin to find a way into his writing.\nIn the letter in which he first mentions Kelly, Howard thanks Lovecraft for putting him in touch with William B. Talman. Talman was an employee of Texaco, and wrote to Howard concerning contributions to his company periodical, The Texaco Star.  Howard's article \"The Ghost of Camp Colorado\" appeared in The Texaco Star a few months later in April 1931.\nIt was also in 1931 that Howard submitted a follow-up article to The Texaco Star entitled \"Kelly the Conjure-Man\". The article begins with:\n\nAbout seventy-five miles north-east of the great Smackover oil field of Arkansas lies a densely wooded country of pinelands and rivers, rich in folklore and tradition. Here, in the early 1850s came a sturdy race of Scotch-Irish pioneers pushing back the frontier and hewing homes in the tangled wilderness.\nAmong the many picturesque characters of those early days, one figure stands out, sharply, yet dimly limned against a background of dark legendry and horrific fable -- the sinister figure of Kelly, the black conjurer.\nFrom there, Howard expands on the story of Kelly as recounted to Lovecraft.\n\"Kelly the Conjure-Man\" was rejected by The Texaco Star and only saw publication decades after Howard's death. However, a seed had been planted in Howard's imagination to germinate for several years. Eventually, Howard recast Kelly as Saul Stark in \"Black Canaan\"."

Holmes, Watson and Pycroft travel by train to Birmingham, where the job is initially to be based, and Pycroft explains that he was recently made redundant from a stockbroking house. He eventually secured a new post with another group of stockbrokers, Mawson and Williams, in Lombard Street in the City. Before taking up the job, he was approached by Arthur Pinner, who offered him a managership with a newly established hardware distribution company, to be based in France.\nPycroft is sent to Birmingham to meet Pinner's brother and company co-founder, Harry Pinner. He is offered a very well-paid post with \u00a3100 in advance, and is asked to sign a document accepting the post, and is also asked not to send a letter of resignation to his current employers. He immediately commences his duties, but he is concerned about the unprofessional aspects of the business and their sparse offices, as well as the suspicious fact that the two Pinners have a distinctive gold filling in their teeth in the same place, suggesting that they might be the same man.\nWhen the trio arrive at the office, on Corporation Street, Birmingham, with Holmes and Watson presented as fellow job-seekers, Pinner is reading a London newspaper and is clearly in shock. As they leave, he attempts suicide, but Watson is able to revive him. Holmes concludes that the story of the brothers is a fabrication and that there is only one 'Pinner'; lacking enough men to make their attempt to deceive Pycroft convincing, Pinner had attempted to pose as his brother to make up the numbers in the hope that Pycroft would dismiss the similarities between them as a family resemblance. He further deduces that the whole point of the exercise was to obtain an example of Pycroft's handwriting so that a 'fake' Pycroft may be employed at Mawsons (hence why they asked him to not officially resign his post). Mawsons was keeping a vast stock of valuable securities, and 'Pycroft' was to be a safebreaker.\nFrom the newspaper, they learn that Mawson & Williams have suffered an attempted robbery, but that the criminal had been captured, although the weekend watchman has been murdered. Beddington, the forger and cracksman, was the miscreant, masquerading as Pycroft, and his brother was masquerading as Pinner.  American railway bonds worth nearly \u00a3100,000 were taken, together with a large amount of scrip in mines and other companies, but the police recovered them from the thief.\nAs the police are called to arrest 'Pinner', Holmes observes that \"Human nature is a strange mixture, Watson. You see that even a villain and murderer can inspire such affection that his brother turns to suicide when he learns that his neck is forfeited\"."

However, in contrast to these other two cases, the 'inconvenient person' in this case proves insightful enough to realize at least some of the deception on his own accord, whereas the other cases see Holmes being brought in to investigate more peripheral matters.\nIt is worth noting that Holmes is not involved in the apprehension of the thief, who has already been arrested, but is able to turn the accomplice over to the police."

Jesus described this as a time of \"Great Tribulation\" worse than anything that had gone before.\nJesus then states that immediately after the time of tribulation people would see a sign, \"the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken\".The statements about the Sun and Moon turning dark sound quite apocalyptic, as it appears to be a quote from the Book of Isaiah. The description of the Sun, Moon and stars going dark is also used elsewhere in the Old Testament. Joel wrote that this would be a sign before the great and dreadful Day of the Lord. The Book of Revelation also mentions the Sun and Moon turning dark during the sixth seal of the seven seals, but the passage adds more detail than the previous verses mentioned.Jesus states that after the time of tribulation and the sign of the Sun, Moon, and stars going dark the Son of Man would be seen arriving in the clouds with power and great glory. The Son of Man would be accompanied by the angels and at the trumpet call the angels would \"gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other\".(Matthew 24:31)\nThose who subscribe to the doctrine of the \"rapture\" (a view popular in American Evangelicalism) find support in this verse. Reading this as meaning that people would be gathered from Earth and taken to heaven. This directly relates to a quotation from the Book of Zechariah in which God (and the contents of heaven in general) will come to Earth and live among the elect, who by necessity are gathered together for this purpose."

        "content": "In the Olivet Discourse, Jesus was reported to have told his disciples,\n\n\"Truly I tell you, this generation [greek: genea] will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.\"\nThere is considerable debate about the correct translation of the word genea. The most common English translation is currently \"generation\", which seem to suggest that the author of the olivet discourse expected Jesus' second coming to be witnessed by Jesus' contemporaries. In most German Bibles however, genea is instead translated as \"family/lineage\" (geschlecht). Likewise for Danish, Swedish and Norwegian (sl\u00e6gt, sl\u00e4kte and slekt, respectively). The Danish linguist Iver Larsen argues that the word \"generation\" as it was used in the English King James Version of the Bible (1611) had a much wider meaning than it has today, and that the correct current translation of genea (in the specific context of the second coming story) should be \"kind of people.\" (specifically the \"good\" kind of people; the disciple's kind of people, who, like the words of Jesus, will endure through all the tribulations). In Psalm 14, the King James version clearly uses \"generation\" in this now outdated sense, when it declares that \"God is in the generation of the righteous.\" According to Larsen, the Oxford Universal Dictionary states that the latest attested use of genea in the sense of \"class, kind or set of persons\" took place in 1727. Larsen concludes that the meaning of \"generation\" in the English language has narrowed considerably since then.Bible scholar Philip La Grange du Toit argues that genea is mostly used to describe a timeless and spiritual family/lineage of good or bad people in The New Testament, and that this is the case also for the second coming discourse in Matthew 24. In contrast to Larsen however, he argues that the word genea here denotes the \"bad\" kind of people,\" because Jesus had used the word in that pejorative sense in the preceding context (chapter 23.) He also lists the main competing translation alternatives, and some of the scholars that support the different views:\n\n\u2018This generation\u2019 refers to Jesus\u2019 contemporaries who would witness \u2018all these things\u2019 [\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c4\u03b1] as outlined in verses 4\u201331, including Jesus\u2019 second coming (Davies & Allison 1997:367\u2013368; Hare 1993:281; Maddox 1982:111\u2013115). Because Jesus\u2019 contemporaries did not witness his second coming, some contend that Jesus erred in his predictions (Luz 2005:209; cf. Schweitzer 1910:356\u2013364).\n\u2018This generation\u2019 refers to Jesus\u2019 contemporaries who would witness \u2018all these things\u2019 as outlined in verses 4\u201322 or 4\u201328, pointing to the destruction of the temple in 70 CE and everything leading up to it. Jesus\u2019 second coming (vv. 29\u201331) is thus excluded from \u2018all these things\u2019 (Blomberg 1992:364; Carson 1984:507; France 2007:930; Hagner 1995:715).\n\u2018This generation\u2019 points to the \u1f38\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9 (Jews or Judaeans), implying that they as a race would last until the Parousia (Hendriksen 1973:868\u2013869; Schweizer 1976:458).\nIn patristic opinion, \u2018this generation\u2019 points to the church against which the gates of Hades would not prevail (cf. Chrysostom, Hom. Matt. 77:1; Eusebius, Frag. in Lc. ad loc).\n\u2018This generation\u2019 points to some future generation, from Matthew\u2019s perspective, that sees \u2018all these things\u2019 (Bock 1996:538\u2013539; Conzelmann 1982:105).\nThe words \u2018take place\u2019 or \u2018have happened\u2019 [\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9] is interpreted as an ingressive aorist: \u2018to begin\u2019 or \u2018to have a beginning\u2019. In other words, \u2018all these things\u2019 would start to happen in the generation of Jesus\u2019 present disciples, but would not necessarily finish in their time (Cranfield 1954:291; Talbert 2010:270).\n\u2018This generation\u2019 points to a certain kind of people in accordance with the pejorative connotations to \u2018generation\u2019 [\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03ac] elsewhere in the gospel (Morris 1992:613; Nelson 1996:385; Rieske 2008:225; see, e.g., Mt 11:16; 12:39, 41\u201342, 45; 16:4; 17:17; 23:36). While DeBruyn (2010:190) and Lenski (1943:953) interpret the expression in a similar way, they connect \u2018this generation\u2019 to a certain kind of people from the \u1f38\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9 who resisted Jesus (cf. view 3 discussed earlier).\nIn the First Epistle to the Thessalonians, Paul seems to envisage that he and the Christians to whom he was writing would see the resurrection of the dead within their own lifetimes: \"For this we declare to you by a word from the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. (ESV)\" The Gospel of John however seems to downplay a rumor that one disciple (John) would live to see the second coming:\"So the rumor spread in the community that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, 'If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?'\""

        "content": "There are four quite different Christian eschatological views.\nPreterism is the belief that all of these predictions were fulfilled by the time Jerusalem fell in 70 AD. Preterism considers that most, if not all, prophecy has been fulfilled already, usually in relation to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70CE.\n\nPartial preterism says that most (but not all) Bible prophecy, including everything within Matthew 24, Daniel, and Revelation up to chapters 19 or 20, has already been fulfilled when Jerusalem was destroyed. Since it still includes belief in a future physical Second Coming of Christ, the resurrection of the dead, and the last judgment, partial preterism falls within the parameters of orthodoxy because it conforms to the early Christian creeds.\nFull preterism says all biblical prophecy was fulfilled by 70CE. It does not hold to a future judgment, return of Christ, or resurrection of the dead (at least not for non-Christians). Due to the belief that all biblical prophecy has been fulfilled, it is sometimes considered \"radical\" and usually described as \"unorthodox\" because it goes against the ecumenical creeds of early Christianity.Historicism considers that most prophecy has been or will be fulfilled during the present church age. It was the chief view of Protestants from the Reformation until the mid-19th century. Only among Seventh-day Adventists is historicism applied to current conservative Christian interpretation of Tribulation understanding.Futurism is the belief that the future Jesus predicted is the unfolding of events from trends that are already at work in contemporary human society.Futurism typically holds that all major unfulfilled prophecies will be fulfilled during a global time of catastrophe and war known as the Great Tribulation, in which many other prophecies will be fulfilled during or after the Millennium Reign of Jesus Christ. According to many futurists, many predictions are currently being fulfilled during the Church Age, in which lawlessness and apostasy are currently plaguing secular society. This is seen as a major sign of the approaching fulfillment of all other prophecies during the Tribulation. Within evangelical Christianity over the past 150 years, futurism has come to be the dominant view of prophecy. However, around the 1970s evangelical preterism\u2014the polar opposite of futurism\u2014was seen as a new challenge to the dominance of futurism, particularly within the Reformed tradition. Yet, futurism continues as the prevalent view for the time being.:\u200ap.7\u200aFuturists anticipate many coming events that will fulfill all eschatological prophecy: the seven-year period of tribulation, the Antichrist's global government the Battle of Armageddon, the Second Coming of Jesus, the millennial reign of Christ, the eternal state, and the two resurrections.\nIn his popular book, The Late Great Planet Earth,  first published in 1970, evangelical Christian author Hal Lindsey argued that prophetical information in Matthew 24 indicates that the \u201cgeneration\u201d witnessing the \u201crebirth of Israel\u201d is the same generation that will observe the fulfillment of the \u201csigns\u201d referred to in Matthew 24:1\u201333\u2014and that would be consummated by the second coming of Christ in approximately 1988. He dated it from the \u201crebirth of Israel\u201d in 1948, and took a generation to be \u201csomething like forty years. \u201d Lindsey later stretched his forty-year timetable to as long as one hundred years, writing that he was no longer certain that the terminal \"generation\" commenced with the rebirth of Israel.Another detailed analysis, one written by evangelical pastor Ray Stedman, calls it the \"Olivet Prophecy: The most detailed prediction in the Bible\". According to Stedman: \"There are many predictive passages in both the Old and New Testaments, but none is clearer or more detailed than the message Jesus delivered from the Mount of Olives. This message was given during the turbulent events of the Lord's last week before the cross\".The Idealist sees no evidence of timing of prophetic events in the Bible. Thus they conclude that their timing cannot be determined in advance. Idealists see prophetic passages as being of great value in teaching truths about God to be applied to present life. Idealism is primarily associated with liberal scholarship, and is not a major factor in current evangelical Christian deliberation over when prophecy will be fulfilled.Within conservative, evangelical Christian thought, two opposite viewpoints of the Great Tribulation have been expressed in a debate between theologians Kenneth L. Gentry and Thomas Ice.:\u200a197\u201399\u200a\nTribulation as a past event (Dr. Gentry)The Great Tribulation occurred during the 1st century.\nThose events marked the end of God's focus on and exaltation of Israel.\nJesus' prophecies marked the beginning of the Christian era in God's plan.\nThe Tribulation is God's judgment on Israel for rejecting the Messiah.\nThe Tribulation judgments will be centred on local events surrounding ancient Jerusalem, and also somewhat affecting other portions of the former Roman Empire.\nThe Tribulation judgments are governed by Jesus as the Christ to reflect his judgment against Israel, thus showing that he is in heaven controlling those events.Tribulation as a future event (Dr. Ice)The Great Tribulation is still to come and is rapidly approaching prospect.\nThose events marked the beginning of God's focus on and exaltation of Israel.\nThe prophecy says the Christian era will be concluded just after the church is taken from the world.\nRather than being God's judgment on Israel, it is the preparation of Israel to receive her Messiah.\nThe judgments involve catastrophes that literally will affect the stellar universe and impact the entire planet.\nThe coming of Christ in the Tribulation requires his public, visible and physical presence to conclude those judgments."

        "content": "Following the death of Howard Ashman, the Walt Disney Company wanted to find another musician to collaborate with Alan Menken on his scores for animated films. Stephen Schwartz, the composer behind the Broadway theater hits Godspell (1971), Pippin (1972), and The Magic Show (1974), received a call from the company asking if he would like to collaborate with Menken. Schwartz had never considered working in the film industry, but agreed to do so nonetheless. Schwartz did not feel he was well-suited to the job.Schwartz wanted to write a song for the film wherein Pocahontas confronts the Eurocentrism of John Smith. \"Colors of the Wind\" was the first song written for Pocahontas. According to Schwartz, the song \"influence[d] the development of the rest of the film.\" Schwartz said that \"a story-board outline was in place before we wrote [the track]. This is often the process in animation, at least as I've experienced it, where everybody works from an outline and each succeeding piece of material, whether it is a song or drawings, influences the next.\" The track was inspired by Native American poetry, music and folklore, as well as a now-debunked  letter that Schwartz believed was sent to the United States Congress by Chief Seattle regarding humanity's relationship with nature but was in fact a fabrication. Part of the letter reads: \"The wind that gave our grandfather his first breath also received his last sigh. The wind also gives our children the spirit of life. So if we sell our land, you must keep it apart and sacred, as a place where man can go to taste the wind that is sweetened by the meadow flowers.\" This portion of the letter inspired the song's title, which Schwartz liked because he saw it as paradoxical and thought-provoking.Schwartz also drew inspiration for \"Colors of the Wind\" from the music of Oscar Hammerstein II and Sheldon Harnick, as it deals with issues of prejudice. Menken said that while \"Colors of the Wind\" was \"born out of the modality of Native American music...it quickly moved to its own place, which is hard to define.\" Menken has noted that the song lacks humor, which he and Schwartz attempted to inject into Pocahontas and failed. Initially, the final lines of the song were \"For your life's an empty hull/till you get it through your skull/you can paint with all the colors of the wind.\" Menken disapproved of these lyrics and asked Schwartz to rewrite them; Schwartz changed the lines to \"You can own the Earth, and still/all you'll own is earth until/you can paint with all the colors of the wind.\" Schwartz preferred the altered lyrics. Schwartz said that this incident taught him the lesson: \"If your collaborator is unhappy, it's probably because [the song] needs to be better,\" adding that he may not have won an Academy Award if he did not change the lyrics. Menken views \"Colors of the Wind\" as one of the most important songs he has written. Schwartz believed that the Walt Disney Company would reject \"Colors of the Wind\" for being philosophical and different from previous Disney songs. Judy Kuhn sang the song to help \"pitch\" Schwartz's score to Disney, and the studio embraced the track. Schwartz and Menken became friends, and later wrote music for the Disney films The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) and Enchanted (2007) together."

        "content": "\"Colors of the Wind\" is a pop ballad written by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz and performed by Judy Kuhn. It has a length of three minutes and thirty-four seconds. According to the Orlando Sentinel, the song does not resemble Native American music. Nonetheless, adding a twist of creative license, the sentiment of First Nation Peoples' relationship to the land and its animals, as well as the contrast between colonialist and indigenous mindsets, are strikingly well portrayed, considering the lyricist's non-indigenous background. The song is about animism and having respect for nature. It features lyrics about \"painting with all the colors of the wind\" and listening to \"the voices of the mountains sing.\"Madhurya Gajula of The Odyssey Online opined that the song's lyrics about nature's interconnectivity bears similarity to transcendentalism, specifically the philosophy of Henry David Thoreau; similarly, Justyna Fruzi\u0144ska wrote in Emerson Goes to the Movies: Individualism in Walt Disney Company's Post-1989 Animated Films that the lyrics of \"Colors of the Wind\" are reminiscent of the writings of transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson and New Age spirituality.  The staff of Billboard likened the lyrics of \"Colors of the Wind\" to a public service announcement about embracing diversity. Sonically, Rita Kempley of The Washington Post found \"Colors of the Wind\" akin to music from Busby Berkeley films and The Little Mermaid (1989).The song also features a mention of a \"blue corn moon\"; there is no such thing according to Charisse, although in general the blue-green distinction is ambiguous in many languages. Responding to a fan inquiry, Schwartz admitted that he coined the phrase after reading a Native American love poem which read: \"I will come to you in the moon of green corn\"; Native Americans referred to months as \"moons\" and named them after events that happened seasonally, such as the sprouting of green corn. This system was subsequently appropriated by colonists, and a modified version appears in the Farmers' Almanac. Schwartz disliked the phrase \"green corn moon\" due to the sound of the word \"green\" and because he felt it might evoke the urban legend that the Moon is made of green cheese. Instead, Schwartz used the phrase \"blue corn moon\" as it reminded him of both blue moons and blue corn tortillas. Schwartz thought that the phrase might evoke the Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands rather than the Algonquian people depicted in Pocahontas, but was satisfied with it anyway."

Jordan Appugliesi of Mic ranked it the sixth best song from a Disney soundtrack, saying that it is \"a poignant, memorable ballad\" in the vein of \"Reflection\" from Mulan (1998). Rita Kempler of The Washington Post felt that the \"stirring anthem\" is the song from Pocahontas which \"comes closest to a show-stopper.\" The staff of Billboard called the song \"artistic\" and \"wistful\" and ranked it the ninth best song of the Disney Renaissance. Writing for The Austin Chronicle, Hollis Chacona opined \"Unlike so many film composers of late, Menken knows when to keep quiet and when to let loose his powerful score. That power soars through its centerpiece (and no doubt Oscar-bound) song, 'Colors of the Wind,' performed by Judy Kuhn.\"Dorkys Ramos of Time Out said that the song and \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" from Pinocchio (1940) are \"at the top of our list when it comes to songs we don't tire of hearing again and again.\"Spin's Andrew Unterberger criticized the track's \"patronizing\" portrayal of Native American beliefs, but said that \"man...Judy Kuhn's voice soars, with those little trills and sweeping highs. It makes it much easier to get behind what's ultimately an agreeable message of environmental awareness and acceptance.\" Aylin Zafar of BuzzFeed ranked \"Colors of the Wind\" the ninth best Disney song, commending it for \"encourag[ing] people to appreciate the world around them and to seek to understand others before judging them.\" Screen Rant's Turner Minton viewed \"Colors of the Wind\" as the tenth best Disney song and \"an anthem about the harmonious nature of the shared world which embraces all races of people.\"Charles Solomon of the Los Angeles Times viewed \"Colors of the Wind\" and \"When She Loved Me\" from Toy Story 2 (1999) as the only Disney songs released since Howard Ashman's death which \"approached the standards\" of the music from Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Aladdin (1992). The staff of People said that the track is \"performed effectively within the body of the film by Kuhn\".CollegeHumor's Willie Muse wrote that \"even though Pocahontas as a whole is completely forgettable, I guarantee everyone reading this knows every single lyric of [\"Colors of the Wind\"].

Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly stated that Pocahontas' \"Alan Menken-Stephen Schwartz songs have all the flavor of uncooked dough\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone criticized the song for its \"political correctness\" and for \"sermoniz[ing] about ecology by using pedestrian conceits\".\nThe track won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, and the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media."

        "content": "The first seed of the story's first chapter The Horror in Clay came from one of Lovecraft's own dreams he had in 1919, which he described briefly in two different letters sent to his friend Rheinhart Kleiner on May 21 and December 14, 1920. In the dream, Lovecraft is visiting an antiquity museum in Providence, attempting to convince the aged curator there to buy an odd bas-relief Lovecraft himself had sculpted. The curator initially scoffs at him for trying to sell something recently made to a museum of antique objects. Lovecraft then remembers himself answering the curator:\n\nWhy do you say that this thing is new? The dreams of men are older than brooding Egypt or the contemplative Sphinx, or garden-girdled Babylon, and this was fashioned in my dreams.\nThis can be compared to what the character of Henry Anthony Wilcox tells the main character's uncle while showing him his sculpted bas-relief for help in reading hieroglyphs on it which came through Wilcox's own fantastical dreams:\n\nIt is new, indeed, for I made it last night in a dream of strange cities; and dreams are older than brooding Tyre or the contemplative Sphinx, or garden-girdled Babylon.\nLovecraft then used this for a brief synopsis of a new story outlined in his own Commonplace Book at first in August 1925, which developed organically out of the idea of what the bas-relief in the dream actually might have depicted. In a footnote for his writing down of his own dream, Lovecraft then finished with the suggestion \"Add good development & describe nature of bas-relief\" to himself for future reference.Cthulhu Mythos scholar Robert M. Price claims the irregular sonnet \"The Kraken\", published in 1830 by Alfred Tennyson, was a major inspiration, since both reference a huge aquatic creature sleeping for an eternity at the bottom of the ocean and destined to emerge from its slumber in an apocalyptic age.S. T. Joshi and David E. Schultz cited other literary inspirations: Guy de Maupassant's \"The Horla\" (1887), which Lovecraft described in Supernatural Horror in Literature as concerning \"an invisible being who...sways the minds of others, and seems to be the vanguard of a horde of extraterrestrial organisms arrived on Earth to subjugate and overwhelm mankind\"; and Arthur Machen's \"The Novel of the Black Seal\" (1895), which uses the same method of piecing together of disassociated knowledge (including a random newspaper clipping) to reveal the survival of a horrific ancient being.It is also assumed he got inspiration from William Scott-Elliot's The Story of Atlantis (1896) and The Lost Lemuria (1904), which Lovecraft read in 1926 shortly before he started to work on the story.Price also notes that Lovecraft admired the work of Lord Dunsany, who wrote The Gods of Pegana (1905), which depicts a god constantly lulled to sleep to avoid the consequences of its reawakening. Another Dunsany work cited by Price is A Shop in Go-by Street (1919), which stated \"the heaven of the gods who sleep\", and \"unhappy are they that hear some old god speak while he sleeps being still deep in slumber\".The \"slight earthquake\" mentioned in the story is likely the 1925 Charlevoix\u2013Kamouraska earthquake.S.T. Joshi has also cited A. Merritt's novella The Moon Pool (1918) which Lovecraft 'frequently rhapsodied about'. Joshi says that 'Merritt's mention of a \"moon-door\" that, when tilted, leads the characters into a lower region of wonder and horror seems similar to the huge door whose inadvertent opening by the sailors causes Cthulhu to emerge from R'lyeh'.Edward Guimont has argued that H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds was an influence on \"The Call of Cthulhu\", citing the thematic similarities of ancient, powerful, but indifferent aliens associated with deities; physical similarities between Cthulhu and the Martians; and the plot detail of a ship ramming an alien in a temporarily successful but ultimately futile gesture."

        "content": "The narrator, Francis Wayland Thurston, recounts his discovery of notes left behind by his grand-uncle, Brown University linguistic professor George Gammell Angell, after his death in the winter of 1926\u201327. Among the notes is a small bas-relief sculpture of a scaly creature which yields \"simultaneous pictures of an octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature.\" The sculptor, a Rhode Island art student named Henry Anthony Wilcox, based the work on delirious dreams of \"great Cyclopean cities of titan blocks and sky-flung monoliths.\" Frequent references to Cthulhu and R'lyeh are found in Wilcox's papers. Angell also discovers reports of mass hysteria around the world.\nMore notes discuss a 1908 meeting of an archeological society in which New Orleans police official John Raymond Legrasse asks attendees to identify a statuette of unidentifiable greenish-black stone resembling Wilcox's sculpture. It is then revealed that the previous year, Legrasse and a party of policemen found several women and children being used in a ritual by an all-male cult. After killing five of the cultists and arresting 47 others, Legrasse learns that they worship the \"Great Old Ones\" and await the return of a monstrous being called Cthulhu. The prisoners identify the statuette as \"great Cthulhu.\" One of the academics present at the meeting, Princeton professor William Channing Webb, describes a group of \"Esquimaux\" with similar beliefs and fetishes.\nThurston discovers a 1925 article from an Australian newspaper which reports the discovery of a derelict ship, the Alert, of which second mate Gustaf Johansen is the sole survivor. Johansen reports that the Emma was attacked by a heavily armed yacht named the Alert. The crewmen of the Emma killed those aboard the Alert, but lost their own ship in the battle, commandeered the Alert, and discovered an uncharted island in the vicinity of co-ordinates of 47\u00b09\u2032S 126\u00b043\u2032W. With the exception of Johansen and another man, the remaining crew died on the island. Johansen does not reveal the manner of their death.\nUpon traveling to Australia, Thurston views a statue retrieved from the Alert which is identical to the previous two. In Norway, he learns that Johansen died suddenly after an encounter with \"two Lascar sailors\". Johansen's widow provides Thurston with her late husband's manuscript, wherein the uncharted island is described as being home to a \"nightmare corpse-city\" called R'lyeh. Johansen's crew struggled to comprehend the non-Euclidean geometry of the city and accidentally released Cthulhu, resulting in their deaths. Johansen and one crewmate fled aboard the Alert and were pursued by Cthulhu. Johansen rammed the yacht into the creature's head, only for its injury to regenerate. The Alert escaped, but Johansen's crewmate died. After finishing the manuscript, Thurston realizes he is now a target of Cthulhu's worshippers."

Howard (creator of Conan the Barbarian) as \"a masterpiece, which I am sure will live as one of the highest achievements of literature.... Mr. Lovecraft holds a unique position in the literary world; he has grasped, to all intents, the worlds outside our paltry ken\". Lovecraft scholar Peter Cannon regarded the story as \"ambitious and complex...a dense and subtle narrative in which the horror gradually builds to cosmic proportions\", adding \"one of [Lovecraft's] bleakest fictional expressions of man's insignificant place in the universe\".French novelist Michel Houellebecq, in his book H. P. Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life, described the story as the first of Lovecraft's \"great texts\".Canadian mathematician Benjamin K.

They are among the most accurate (in technical terms, reliable and valid) of all psychological tests and assessments.\"\n\"While there are different types of intelligence tests, they all measure the same intelligence.\"\n\"The spread of people along the IQ continuum ... can be represented well by the ... 'normal curve'.\"\n\"Intelligence tests are not culturally biased\".\n\"The brain processes underlying intelligence are still little understood\".\n\"Members of all racial-ethnic groups can be found at every IQ level...The bell curves for some groups (Jews and East Asians) are centered somewhat higher than for whites in general. Other groups (blacks and Hispanics) are centered somewhat lower than non-Hispanic whites.\"\n\"The bell curve for whites is centered roughly around IQ 100; the bell curve for American blacks roughly around 85; and those for different subgroups of Hispanics roughly midway between those for whites and blacks. The evidence is less definitive for exactly where above IQ 100 the bell curves for Jews and Asians are centered\".\n\"IQ is strongly related, probably more so than any other single measurable human trait, to many important educational, occupational, economic, and social outcomes ... Whatever IQ tests measure, it is of great practical and social importance\".\n\"A high IQ is an advantage because virtually all activities require some reasoning and decision-making\".\n\"The practical advantages of having a higher IQ increase as life's settings become more complex\".\n\"Differences in intelligence certainly are not the only factor affecting performance in education, training, and complex jobs ... but intelligence is often the most important\".\n\"Certain personality traits, special talents, [etc] are important ... in many jobs, but they have narrower (or unknown) applicability or 'transferability' across tasks and settings compared with general intelligence\".\n\"Heritability estimates range from 0.4 to 0.8 ... indicating genetics plays a bigger role than environment in creating IQ differences\".\n\"Members of the same family also tend to differ substantially in intelligence\".\n\"That IQ may be highly heritable does not mean that it is not affected by the environment ... IQs do gradually stabilize during childhood, however, and generally change little thereafter\".\n\"Although the environment is important in creating IQ differences, we do not know yet how to manipulate it\".\n\"Genetically caused differences are not necessarily irremediable\".\n\"There is no persuasive evidence that the IQ bell curves for different racial-ethnic groups are converging\".\n\"Racial-ethnic differences in IQ bell curves are essentially the same when youngsters leave high school as when they enter first grade ... black 17-year-olds perform, on the average, more like white 13-year-olds\".\n\"The reasons that blacks differ among themselves in intelligence appear to be the same as those for why whites ... differ among themselves\".\n\"There is no definitive answer as to why bell curves differ across racial-ethnic groups. The reasons for these IQ differences between groups may be markedly different from the reasons for why individuals differ among themselves within any particular group\".\n\"Racial-ethnic differences are somewhat smaller but still substantial for individuals from the same socio-economic backgrounds\".\n\"Almost all Americans who identify themselves as black have white ancestors \u2013 the white admixture is about 20% ... research on intelligence relies on self-classification into distinct racial categories\".\n\"The research findings neither dictate nor preclude any particular social policy, because they can never determine our goals. They can, however, help us estimate the likely success and side-effects of pursuing those goals via different means\"."

        "content": "A 1995 article by Joseph L. Graves & Amanda Johnson was critical of the scientific basis on which Mainstream Science on Intelligence rested. The article stated that the statements in Mainstream Science on Intelligence ...certainly fall in line with general Euro-American impressions of race and intelligence. The problem, however, is that none of the ideas these psychometricians support have any relation to legitimate scientific inference. Even though individuals like psychologist J. Philippe Rushton have published monumental treatises to support the claim of Nordic racial superiority, and despite the flamboyant approaches of Shockley, Jensen, Herrnstein, and Murray, there remain only two ways the psychometric syllogism can be deemed acceptable-- either: (a) one has little or no knowledge of the broad areas of the scientific method, statistical reasoning, population studies, quantitative genetics, developmental physiology, neurophysiology, environmental toxicology, sociology, educational psychology, economics, and history required to adequately comprehend the issues involved; or (b) one has no desire to examine the facts of this problem objectively.\nIn a posthumous article in 1996, Donald T. Campbell, a former president of the American Psychological Association, included his own analysis of the Wall Street Journal statement, drafted previously as a letter to that newspaper. Campbell first remarked that:\n\nOf the 52 signatories, there were 10 whom I would regard as measurement experts. I do not have a list of those who were asked to sign and refused, but I know they included Lee Cronbach, Robert Sternberg, and myself.\nHe remarked that the rhetorical organization of statements in the letter seemed to him to imply, inadvertently or deliberately, the conclusion that the black-white racial gap had a genetic cause. He said that for statement 5, no provision had been allowed for differences in educational opportunity. Later on regarding statement 14, he judged that the claims for heritability had been made without mentioning that it was based on twin studies, where environmental opportunities had been excluded as possible factors. For statement 23, he said that it was not possible to compare children of black and white parents that were \"equally\" educated, because in these circumstances the opportunities in the quality of education, both before and at college, would differ. For statement 25, Campbell remarked that Jensen had himself published policy recommendations concerning rote learning.As Hauser (2010) reports in his discussion of the editorial, there is not any general agreement about what is meant by intelligence. The editorial gave the following general definition of intelligence:\nIntelligence is a very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience. It is not merely book-learning, a narrow academic skill, or test-taking smarts. Rather, it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings \"catching on,\" \"making sense\" of things, or \"figuring out\" what to do.\nGottfredson (1997b) describes intelligence in her own article in the same volume less broadly as \"the ability to deal with complexity\".  However, the article by Carroll (1997a), one of the signatories of the statement, reviewed the numerous attempts in the academic literature to define what was meant by intelligence and found that there was not any agreement. He cites experts as describing intelligence as \"the total intellectual repertoire of behavioral responses,\" \"some\ngeneral property or quality ... of the brain,\" \"reaction-time and physiological measures,\" \"many different information-processing abilities\" and\n\"the rate with which learning occurs or the time required for learning.\" Plomin & Petrill (1997c) in the same volume describe intelligence as what is measured by intelligence tests: \"What we mean by intelligence is general cognitive functioning (g) as assessed in the psychometric tradition of a general factor derived from a battery of diverse cognitive ability tests\".\nHarrington (1997) gives a point-by-point analysis of the conclusions of the letter. He states that the validity of tests is claimed as a property of the tests, rather than how or where they are used. He questioned the letter's claims about there not being any cultural bias in IQ tests; and that intelligence was a major factor determining fitness in human evolution, something that he argued was inconsistent with the claims of heritability, if the geneticist's version of evolution was being used. Harrington argued that heritability is phylogenetic, not ontogenetic as the letter suggested. He pointed out that the use of the term \"race\" differed from the way geneticists classify population groups. Regarding the assertion that IQ research does not preclude or dictate any particular social policy, Harrington commented that the opinions of Charles Murray concerning social policy have been used by US Congressmen to argue for policy changes.\nThe validity of the \"mainstream science\" described in the editorial was also questioned by Belkhir & Duyme (1998), who argued that the signatories were attempting to revive the \"pseudo-scientific inquiry\" of biological determinism.\nIn a 2001 article in Trends in Cognitive Sciences, Ian J. Deary noted that The Wall Street Journal \"... is an odd place for such a document, and readers might view the signatories as one-sided, largely committed to the psychometrics-based intelligence research they were endorsing\".Alderfer (2003) analysed the editorial as one of five responses to The Bell Curve, a book which he described as \"an attempt to influence both psychological knowledge and U.S. politics\". He concluded that some of the responses, including the editorial, \"fell far short of providing a critical analysis of the book's racially biased argument and did little to reduce the misleading picture of race and IQ that the book promulgated\". More specifically, Alderfer criticized the failure of the psychologists to recognize the effect of such a book on race relations in the US; as well as their failure to discuss the third and last part of the book on the implications for social policy.  He wrote that, \"Some psychologists said they wanted to keep themselves out of the emotional turmoil that had been generated by publication of the Bell Curve ... They might also have wanted to preserve the neutrality of psychology as a science. When examined in the contemporary racial context, however, their action was neither scientifically nor politically neutral. Essentially, they took a stand by not taking a stand. Their stand was not to become involved in how their expertise might be used to affect people's lives ...they missed an opportunity to caution their readers about regressive forces affecting U.S. race relations and to locate the book within that context. They did not fully use the authority based on their expertise to prevent harm.\"\nSchlinger (2003) argued: \n\nWith a few exceptions, the list of cosigners reads like a Who's Who of those theorists (e.g., Thomas J. Bouchard, Jr., John B. Carroll, Raymond B. Cattell, Hans Eysenck, Linda S. Gottfredson, Seymour W. Itzkoff, Arthur R. Jensen, Robert Plomin, J. Philippe Rushton and Vincent Sarich) who have continued Spearman's tradition of factor analyzing intelligence test scores to generate a theory of general intelligence \u2014 g \u2014 and some of whom (e.g., Thomas J. Bouchard, Robert Plomin) believe that behavior genetic research supports the conclusion that g is highly heritable, and others of whom (e.g., Arthur Jensen, J. Philippe Rushton, Seymour Itzkoff) have written highly emotionally charged articles arguing that the research supports the conclusion that group differences on intelligence tests reflect genetic differences.\n\nArmour-Thomas (2003) argued that the statement's claim that IQ tests were unbiased is not accepted by some prominent researchers of psychometrics who have described problems with using tests on population groups with a substantively different cultural background from those for whom the test was originally designed.\nAnthropologist Robert Wald Sussman criticized the statement in his 2014 book The Myth of Race, writing, \"In this letter, the members of the new bigot brigade claimed that since as many as fifty-two scientists signed this letter, the contents of the book [i.e. the Bell Curve] and of the letter must be true. Using this logic, since the vast majority of anthropologists and other social scientists and of geneticists do not agree with the conclusions of this volume, does that mean it must be false? Obviously not. However, it is the actual science that began with Boas and his colleagues and that has continued to this date that makes these authors' beliefs and approach untenable at any level.\"The Southern Poverty Law Center states that some of the editorial's signatories \"...had no relevant qualifications at all. Garrett Hardin, for example, was an ecologist and anti-immigration activist, while Vincent Sarich was an anthropologist who gained notoriety for making racist and homophobic claims in his undergraduate courses (he later admitted to The New York Times that these assertions were not based on established scientific facts).\" After citing Campbell's estimate that only 10 signatories were experts on the measurement of intelligence, the Center noted that \"...at least 20 [signatories] were recipients of money from the Pioneer Fund, including one director of the Fund, R. Travis Osborne, and two future presidents, J. Philippe Rushton and Richard Lynn.\"\nIn a 2015 interview, behavior geneticist Robert Plomin was asked whether he regretted signing the statement.  He reiterated his support for the factual assertions in the letter, but rejected interpretations of that data in The Bell Curve:   Well, I regret it to the extent it's a distraction to my research. But I think the basic facts are there...erm, about heritability of intelligence, and it's just so unfortunate that some of the interpretations [Murray and Herrnstein] made from that data are so, you know, some of them are quite bizarre and I would make just the opposite sorts of interpretations."

The list also included compilations and \"greatest hits\" collections.An amended list was released as a book in 2005, with an introduction by guitarist Steven Van Zandt. Some compilation albums were removed, and Robert Johnson's The Complete Recordings was substituted for both of his King of the Delta Blues Singers volumes, making room for a total of eight new entries on the list.On May 31, 2012, Rolling Stone published a revised list, drawing on the original and a later survey of albums up until the early 2000s. It was made available in \"bookazine\" format on newsstands in the US from April 27 to July 25. The new list contained 38 albums not present in the previous one, 16 of them released after 2003. The top listings remained unchanged.\nMost of the albums on the initial lists were by white male rock musicians. Among the top 50 rankings, only 12 entries were by artists of color, none of whom were female, and only three albums by white women figured in the top 50.On September 22, 2020, another revision of the list was published.

This time, the list included more musicians who were female and people of color, with many such artists represented at higher rankings than on the previous lists. 86 of the entries were 21st-century releases. One hundred fifty-four new entries were not on either of the two previous editions, and rap albums figured three times as much. Marvin Gaye's What's Going On (1971) was featured at the number one spot.The 2023 revision was created using the same method as the 2020 list."

It was first published in the literary journal The Russian Messenger in twelve monthly installments during 1866. It was later published in a single volume. It is the second of Dostoevsky's full-length novels following his return from ten years of exile in Siberia. Crime and Punishment is considered the first great novel of his mature period of writing and is often cited as one of the greatest works of world literature.Crime and Punishment follows the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in Saint Petersburg who plans to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker, an old woman who stores money and valuable objects in her flat. He theorises that with the money he could liberate himself from poverty and go on to perform great deeds, and seeks to convince himself that certain crimes are justifiable if they are committed in order to remove obstacles to the higher goals of 'extraordinary' men. Once the deed is done, however, he finds himself wracked with confusion, paranoia, and disgust. His theoretical justifications lose all their power as he struggles with guilt and horror and is confronted with both internal and external consequences of his deed."

        "content": "At the time Dostoevsky owed large sums of money to creditors and was trying to help the family of his brother Mikhail, who had died in early 1864. After appeals elsewhere failed, Dostoevsky turned as a last resort to the publisher Mikhail Katkov and sought an advance on a proposed contribution. He offered his story or novella (at the time he was not thinking of a novel) for publication in Katkov's monthly journal The Russian Messenger\u2014a prestigious publication of its kind, and the outlet for both Ivan Turgenev and Leo Tolstoy. Dostoevsky, having been engaged in polemical debates with Katkov in the early 1860s, had never published anything in its pages before. In a letter to Katkov written in September 1865, Dostoevsky explained to him that the work was to be about a young man who yields to \"certain strange, 'unfinished' ideas, yet floating in the air\". He planned to explore the moral and psychological dangers of the ideology of \"radicalism\", and felt that the project would appeal to the conservative Katkov. In letters written in November 1865 an important conceptual change occurred: the \"story\" had become a \"novel\". From then on, Crime and Punishment is referred to as a novel.\n\nIn the complete edition of Dostoevsky's writings published in the Soviet Union, the editors reassembled the writer's notebooks for Crime and Punishment in a sequence roughly corresponding to the various stages of composition. As a result, there exists a fragmentary working draft of the novella, as initially conceived, as well as two other versions of the text. These have been distinguished as the Wiesbaden edition, the Petersburg edition, and the final plan, involving the shift from a first-person narrator to Dostoevsky's innovative use of third-person narrative to achieve first-person narrative perspectives. Dostoevsky initially considered four first-person plans: a memoir written by Raskolnikov, his confession recorded eight days after the murder, his diary begun five days after the murder, and a mixed form in which the first half was in the form of a memoir, and the second half in the form of a diary. The Wiesbaden edition concentrates entirely on the moral and psychological reactions of the narrator after the murder. It coincides roughly with the story that Dostoevsky described in his letter to Katkov and, written in the form of a diary or journal, corresponds to what eventually became part 2 of the finished work.\n\nWhy Dostoevsky abandoned his initial version remains a matter of speculation. According to Joseph Frank, \"one possibility is that his protagonist began to develop beyond the boundaries in which he had first been conceived\". The notebooks indicate that Dostoevsky became aware of the emergence of new aspects of Raskolnikov's character as the plot developed, and he structured the novel in conformity with this \"metamorphosis\". The final version of Crime and Punishment came into being only when, in November 1865, Dostoevsky decided to recast his novel in the third person. This shift was the culmination of a long struggle, present through all the early stages of composition. Once having decided, Dostoevsky began to rewrite from scratch and was able to easily integrate sections of the early manuscript into the final text. Frank says that he did not, as he told Wrangel, burn everything he had written earlier.Dostoevsky was under great pressure to finish Crime and Punishment on time, as he was simultaneously contracted to finish The Gambler for the prominent Russian publisher Fyodor Stellovsky, who had imposed extremely harsh conditions. Anna Snitkina, a stenographer who later became Dostoevsky's wife, was of great help to him during this difficult task. The first part of Crime and Punishment appeared in the January 1866 issue of The Russian Messenger, and the last one was published in December 1866."

        "content": "In Crime and Punishment, Dostoevsky fuses the personality of his main character, Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, with his new anti-radical ideological themes. The main plot involves a murder as the result of \"ideological intoxication,\" and depicts all the disastrous moral and psychological consequences that result from the murder. Raskolnikov's psychology is placed at the center, and carefully interwoven with the ideas behind his transgression; every other feature of the novel illuminates the agonizing dilemma in which Raskolnikov is caught. From another point of view, the novel's plot is another variation of a conventional nineteenth-century theme: an innocent young provincial comes to seek his fortune in the capital, where he succumbs to corruption, and loses all traces of his former freshness and purity. However, as Gary Rosenshield points out, \"Raskolnikov succumbs not to the temptations of high society as Honor\u00e9 de Balzac's Rastignac or Stendhal's Julien Sorel, but to those of rationalistic Petersburg\"."

        "content": "The novel is divided into six parts, with an epilogue. The notion of \"intrinsic duality\" in Crime and Punishment has been commented upon, with the suggestion that there is a degree of symmetry to the book. Edward Wasiolek, who has argued that Dostoevsky was a skilled craftsman, highly conscious of the formal pattern in his art, has likened the structure of Crime and Punishment to a \"flattened X\", saying:\n\nParts I\u2013III [of Crime and Punishment] present the predominantly rational and proud Raskolnikov: Parts IV\u2013VI, the emerging \"irrational\" and humble Raskolnikov. The first half of the novel shows the progressive death of the first ruling principle of his character; the last half, the progressive birth of the new ruling principle. The point of change comes in the very middle of the novel.\nThis compositional balance is achieved by means of the symmetrical distribution of certain key episodes throughout the novel's six parts. The recurrence of these episodes in the two halves of the novel, as David Bethea has argued, is organized according to a mirror-like principle, whereby the \"left\" half of the novel reflects the \"right\" half.The seventh part of the novel, the Epilogue, has attracted much attention and controversy. Some of Dostoevsky's critics have criticized the novel's final pages as superfluous, anticlimactic, unworthy of the rest of the work, while others have defended it, offering various schemes that they claim prove its inevitability and necessity. Steven Cassedy argues that Crime and Punishment \"is formally two distinct but closely related, things, namely a particular type of tragedy in the classical Greek mold and a Christian resurrection tale\". Cassedy concludes that \"the logical demands of the tragic model as such are satisfied without the Epilogue in Crime and Punishment ... At the same time, this tragedy contains a Christian component, and the logical demands of this element are met only by the resurrection promised in the Epilogue\"."

        "content": "Crime and Punishment is written from a third-person omniscient perspective. It is told primarily from the point of view of Raskolnikov, but does at times switch to the perspective of other characters such as Svidriga\u00eflov, Razumikhin, Luzhin, Sonya or Dunya. This narrative technique, which fuses the narrator very closely with the consciousness and point of view of the central characters, was original for its period. Frank notes that Dostoevsky's use of time shifts of memory and manipulation of temporal sequence begins to approach the later experiments of Henry James, Joseph Conrad, Virginia Woolf, and James Joyce. A late nineteenth-century reader was, however, accustomed to more orderly and linear types of expository narration. This led to the persistence of the legend that Dostoevsky was an untidy and negligent craftsman, and to observations like the following by Melchior de Vog\u00fc\u00e9: \"A word ... one does not even notice, a small fact that takes up only a line, have their reverberations fifty pages later ... [so that] the continuity becomes unintelligible if one skips a couple of pages\".Dostoevsky uses different speech mannerisms and sentences of different length for different characters. Those who use artificial language\u2014Luzhin, for example\u2014are identified as unattractive people. Mrs. Marmeladov's disintegrating mind is reflected in her language. In the original Russian text, the names of the major characters have something of a double meaning, but in translation the subtlety of the Russian language is predominantly lost due to differences in language structure and culture. For example, the original Russian title (\"\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\") is not the direct equivalent to the English \"Crime and Punishment\". \"\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\" (Prestupl\u00e9niye) is literally translated as 'a stepping across'. The physical image of crime as crossing over a barrier or a boundary is lost in translation, as is the religious implication of transgression."

Tolstoy's novel War and Peace was being serialized in The Russian Messenger at the same time as Crime and Punishment.\nThe novel soon attracted the criticism of the liberal and radical critics. G.Z. Yeliseyev sprang to the defense of the Russian student corporations, and wondered, \"Has there ever been a case of a student committing murder for the sake of robbery?\" Pisarev, aware of the novel's artistic value, described Raskolnikov as a product of his environment, and argued that the main theme of the work was poverty and its results. He measured the novel's excellence by the accuracy with which Dostoevsky portrayed the contemporary social reality, and focused on what he regarded as inconsistencies in the novel's plot. Strakhov rejected Pisarev's contention that the theme of environmental determinism was essential to the novel, and pointed out that Dostoevsky's attitude towards his hero was sympathetic: \"This is not mockery of the younger generation, neither a reproach nor an accusation\u2014it is a lament over it.\" Solovyov felt that the meaning of the novel, despite the common failure to understand it, is clear and simple: a man who considers himself entitled to 'step across' discovers that what he thought was an intellectually and even morally justifiable transgression of an arbitrary law turns out to be, for his conscience, \"a sin, a violation of inner moral justice... that inward sin of self-idolatry can only be redeemed by an inner act of self-renunciation.\"The early Symbolist movement that dominated Russian letters in the 1880s was concerned more with aesthetics than the visceral realism and intellectuality of Crime and Punishment, but a tendency toward mysticism among the new generation of symbolists in the 1900s led to a reevaluation of the novel as an address to the dialectic of spirit and matter. In the character of Sonya (Sofya Semyonovna) they saw an embodiment of both the Orthodox feminine principle of hagia sophia (holy wisdom) \u2013 \"at once sexual and innocent, redemptive both in her suffering and her veneration of suffering\", and the most important feminine deity of Russian folklore mat syra zemlya (moist mother earth). Raskolnikov is a \"son of Earth\" whose egoistic aspirations lead him to ideas and actions that alienate him from the very source of his strength, and he must bow down to her before she can relieve him of the terrible burden of his guilt. Philosopher and Orthodox theologian Nikolay Berdyaev shared Solovyov and the symbolists' sense of the novel's spiritual significance, seeing it as an illustration of the modern age's hubristic self-deification, or what he calls \"the suicide of man by self-affirmation\". Raskolnikov answers his question of whether he has the right to kill solely by reference to his own arbitrary will, but, according to Berdyaev, these are questions that can only be answered by God, and \"he who does not bow before that higher will destroys his neighbor and destroys himself: that is the meaning of Crime and Punishment\".Crime and Punishment was regarded as an important work in a number of 20th-century European cultural movements, notably the Bloomsbury Group, psychoanalysis, and existentialism. Of the writers associated with Bloomsbury, Virginia Woolf, John Middleton Murry and D. H. Lawrence are some of those who have discussed the work. Freud held Dostoevsky's work in high esteem, and many of his followers have attempted psychoanalytical interpretations of Raskolnikov. Among the existentialists, Sartre and Camus in particular have acknowledged Dostoevsky's influence.The affinity of Crime and Punishment with both religious mysticism and psychoanalysis led to suppression of discussion in Soviet Russia: interpretations of Raskolnikov tended to align with Pisarev's idea of reaction to unjust socio-economic conditions. An exception was the work of Mikhail Bakhtin, considered by many commentators to be the most original and insightful analyst of Dostoevsky's work. In Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics, Bakhtin argues that attempts to understand Dostoevsky's characters from the vantage point of a pre-existing philosophy, or as individualized 'objects' to be psychologically analysed, will always fail to penetrate the unique \"artistic architechtonics\" of his works. In such cases, both the critical approach and the assumed object of investigation are 'monological': everything is perceived as occurring within the framework of a single overarching perspective, whether that of the critic or that of the author. Dostoevsky's art, Bakhtin argues, is inherently 'dialogical': events proceed on the basis of interaction between self-validating subjective voices, often within the consciousness of an individual character, as is the case with Raskolnikov. Raskolnikov's consciousness is depicted as a battleground for all the conflicting ideas that find expression in the novel: everyone and everything he encounters becomes reflected and refracted in a \"dialogized\" interior monologue. He has rejected external relationships and chosen his tormenting internal dialogue; only Sonya is capable of continuing to engage with him despite his cruelty. His openness to dialogue with Sonya is what enables him to cross back over the \"threshold into real-life communication (confession and public trial)\u2014not out of guilt, for he avoids acknowledging his guilt, but out of weariness and loneliness, for that reconciling step is the only relief possible from the cacophony of unfinalized inner dialogue.\""

Created by Mark Millar, it is set in the Judge Dredd universe, fifty years after the events detailed in the current Judge Dredd comics. The series debuted in Judge Dredd Megazine #1.08, in 1991.\nThe stories focus on a Sov-Block (formerly East-Meg Two, formerly somewhere in Russia) Judge named Razors. Judge Razors is the prototype for a new breed of Judge, a brainwashed ex-gang member, conditioned to follow the orders of his superiors without question.  His partner is a genetically enhanced horse named Comrade Ed."

        "content": "The first storyline focused on the penetration of western culture and capitalism behind the iron curtain (for example, Elvis Presley is worshipped as a God). The storyline can be thought of as a satirical comment on Russia's current integration of western elements with its own culture. Subsequent entries were much more action-oriented, with little or no satire.  Cameos in the series have included Judge Dredd. \nIn his last appearance, Razors threw off his brainwashing and went on a killing spree, which ended when he was shot and killed by Dredd. Also there are obvious references in the series to other series (TV especially.)  The main example is Comrade Ed, Razor's partner which is an obvious \"take off\" of Mister Ed, the talking horse."
