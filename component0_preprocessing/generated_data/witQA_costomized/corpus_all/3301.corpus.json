Madeline Roth of MTV News wrote that the performance \"bolstered courage among an audience that desperately needed it. ... Returning to the stage was a true act of bravery and resilience\". The City of Manchester named Grande as an honorary citizen of the city following the singer's \"great many selfless acts and demonstrations of community spirit\" and will be the first to be awarded from the city.Kory Grow in Rolling Stone, wrote \"It felt incredibly safe. As I made my own way to the tram, I wrote in my Apple Notes app, 'Helicopter hovering overhead,' which to me signified that the fans were being watched over. Then two policemen stopped me and asked me who I was with and whether I'd written anything about a helicopter into my phone, without explaining the technology of how they'd read my Notes app. After a friendly back-and-forth, they looked through my bag, checked my ID and business card and determined I wasn't a threat. 'You have to understand, tensions are running high,' one of the men said with a smile and a handshake, allowing me through the gate. Manchester was secure tonight.\" Dee Lockett, in New York's Vulture section, ranked the event as the No. 1 concert of 2017, noting:\n\nLess than two weeks after the attack, and with only a few days to privately process and mourn, Ariana returned to Manchester with an entire benefit concert she coordinated. ... She called in every favor, pulling in famous friends like Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber to show up for the grieving city. After meeting with a parent of one of the victims, Grande said she shifted the tone of the show from somber to celebratory because she understood that it was what her fans needed. ... All night, Ariana performed without breaking, but that was when she had others by her side. ... When it was just her alone with her fans for her finale cover of \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\", the floodgates opened. In what will likely go down as one of the defining moments of her career, she paused the song, looked out to her audience, which was already sobbing along with her, then resumed the music to nail yet another impossible note.\nIn an interview with Billboard magazine, Grande's manager Scooter Braun remarked that \"the City of Manchester was the Hero.\""

        "content": "The Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences (now The Latin Recording Academy) was formed by the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences (now The Recording Academy) in 1997. It was founded by Michael Greene and Producers & Songwriters Rudy P\u00e9rez & Mauricio Abaroa. Rudy P\u00e9rez was the Grammy Florida chapter's first President of the Board. The concept of a separate Grammy Awards for Latin music began in 1989. According to organizers, the Latin Grammy Awards was established as the Latin music universe was deemed too large to fit on the Grammy Awards. The Latin Recording Academy defines Latin music as music in Spanish or Portuguese. The Latin Grammy Awards mainly encompasses music released in Latin America, Spain, Portugal and the Latino United States. In 2000, it was announced that the 1st Annual Latin Grammy Awards would take place at the Staples Center on September 13, 2000. On July 7, 2000, the nominations were announced in Miami, Florida, United States. The Latin Grammys were introduced with over 39 categories included limited to Spanish and Portuguese-speaking recordings. The first telecast took place at the Staples Center and was broadcast. The following year's show was canceled due to the September 11, 2001 attacks, which was the same day the show was to take place. In 2002, the academy elected its first independent board of trustees. In 2005, the broadcast was moved from CBS to Univision where the whole telecast was in Spanish.Voting members live in various regions in the US and outside of the US including Latin America and Iberia. For a recording to be eligible for a nomination, it must have at least 60% (previously 51% until 2024) of its content recorded in Spanish or Portuguese and commercially released in North America, Central America, South America, the Caribbean, Spain, or Portugal. Products recorded in languages and dialects from Ibero-America such as Catalan, Basque, Galician, Valencian, Nahuatl, Guarani, Quechua or Mayan may be accepted by majority vote of the committees of the Latin Recording Academy. The Latin Recording Academy also accepts Latin instrumental music from Ibero-America as well as compositions that have been composed or interpreted by an Iberian American musician. The eligibility period is June 1 to May 30 for a respective awards ceremony. Recordings are first entered and then reviewed to determine the awards they are eligible for. Following that, nominating ballots are mailed to voting members of the academy. The votes are tabulated and the five recordings in each category with the most votes become the nominees. Final voting ballots are sent out to voting members and the winners are determined. Winners are later announced at the Latin Grammy Awards. The current President & CEO of the Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences is Manuel Abud, who succeeded Gabriel Abaroa in 2021.Altogether there are three events: the Life Achievement when renowned artists are honored for lifetime achievement; Person of the Year, when one artist is honored at a gala dinner, and Grammy itself, an award that brings together artists from all over Latin America and Iberia and that today is broadcast live to 80 countries, including Brazil, by channel Univision (TNT in Brazil)."

Manny S. Gonzalez of the Vista En L.A felt that the award would just be used to advertise artists being promoted by Emilio Estefan. The lack of categories for non Spanish and Portuguese-speaking music has been criticized, namely by artists who consider their work to be \"Latin\" in sound or origin but are not eligible for a Latin Grammy including those from Haiti (who have compared their compas music to merengue music from the Dominican Republic but is sung in French Creole) and Celtic musicians from the Galicia and Asturias regions of Spain. The linguistic requirement has also been criticized by Tony Succar whose album, Unity: The Latin Tribute to Michael Jackson, was not eligible for a Latin Grammy Award despite the album being recorded in salsa music. In response to the criticism, a spokesman for the Latin Recording Academy stated: \"The Latin Recording Academy considers music based on the contents of the recording itself \u2013 the technical elements that go into the art of music making \u2013 not based on how a recording or an artist is marketed externally.\" In 2001, Cuban exiles living in Miami protested at the Latin Grammy Awards for allowing musicians living in Cuba to perform at the stage. This resulted in the Latin Grammys being moved to Los Angeles for the second annual awards (which would in the end be canceled in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks).In October 2010, a year in which he did not have any new works eligible for the 11th Annual Latin Grammy Awards, Venezuelan singer-songwriter Franco De Vita \u2013 a previous nominee \u2013 called the Latin Grammys \"fake and a lie\" and stated that if he were to ever win an award, he would not accept it. The following year, he won his first two Latin Grammy Awards, at the 12th Annual Latin Grammy Awards. American musician Willie Col\u00f3n observed the relationship between the Latin Grammys and major Latin record labels. Mexican singer-songwriter Aleks Syntek noted that Mexican artists in general were apathetic towards the awards. The Latin Grammys was met with backlash at the 2019 awards ceremony when none of the urbano artists were nominated in the general categories despite its popularity. This led to several reggaeton artists, including Daddy Yankee and J Balvin, boycotting the event. The Latin Recording Academy responded to criticism by requesting the \"leaders of the urban community to get involved with the Academy, to get involved with the process, and to get involved with discussions that improve the Academy.\" Since the late 2010s, the inclusion of artists from Spain in the awards has garnered controversy from social media users who noted the Spanish colonization of the Americas and the Academy itself has been accused of whitewashing by favoring Spaniards and White Latin Americans over Afro\u2013Latin Americans (who were the main contributors of many Latin music genres including the urbano field such as reggaeton). Abud has responded to criticism on the inclusion of Spain by pointing out that \"Latin music has been defined by Spanish and Portuguese\"."

        "content": "Alan Goodman, Albie Hecht, and Fred Seibert created the awards show after Nickelodeon produced a segment called The Big Ballot for the movie review show Rated K: For Kids by Kids in 1987, named for the ballots kids voted with. To vote, the viewers would send in ballots and then before the show, the ballots would be counted and the winners would tape a \"thank you\" video that would be shown during the program. Goodman, Hecht, and Seibert felt that the network needed a bigger, more exciting platform.\nHecht selected the awards logo from a series of network designs created by original logo designers Tom Corey and Scott Nash (Corey McPherson Nash, Boston), overseen by Goodman and Seibert (Fred/Alan, Inc., New York). The award was configured into the current blimp shape/kaleidoscope in 1990. The only change to the award since then has been a change to the embossed logotype on the side of the trophy for 2010 to fit the network's new logo typeface.\nAs the Internet came into widespread use, the voting finally moved from a combination of 900 number telephone voting and filling paper ballots that were either mailed or completed at Pizza Hut locations, to being conducted exclusively on the network's website, and included text messaging by 2007. During the early years of Internet voting, there were several issues, including the digital equivalent of ballot stuffing and adult voting. As a result, a new system was put into place where one vote per Nick.com account is allowed (although it is probable adults still cast votes via the texting option, which is connected to a phone number only instead of a screen name, by creating an account with a false age, or by having their children vote for a chosen subject instead). In 2010, an iPhone application and mobile browser voting were also added.The 2009 Kids' Choice Awards featured a new award called \"The Big Green Help Award\" which goes to the celebrity who goes above and beyond to help the Earth. The inaugural award was presented to Leonardo DiCaprio. For the 2010 awards, \"The Big Green Help\" award was renamed \"The Big Help\" award, with First Lady Michelle Obama winning the first award under the rename.\nUnlike traditional awards shows, the Kids' Choice Awards uses other items to announce an award winner instead of a traditional envelope. The show sometimes uses balloons, T-shirts, models, giant letters, stickers, and even a foot.\nVoting became available for Canadian people in time for the 2010 ceremony, owing to the inauguration of Nickelodeon's Canadian service in November 2009.\nThe 2020 ceremony was held in a virtual format in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic."

        "content": "The 2017 FA Cup final was an association football match between London rivals Arsenal and Chelsea on 27 May 2017 at Wembley Stadium in London, England. It was the 136th FA Cup final overall of English football's primary cup competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup (FA Cup), organised by the Football Association (FA).   This was a rematch of the 2002 FA Cup Final and the first final since 2003 in which the sides had won once in the Premier League against one another, with a 3\u20130 victory for Arsenal in September 2016, and a 3\u20131 win for Chelsea the following February. The game was broadcast live in the United Kingdom by both BBC and BT Sport. BBC One provided the free-to-air coverage and BT Sport 2 was the pay-TV alternative.  \nThe match was refereed by Anthony Taylor in front of a crowd of 89,472.  Arsenal kicked off and dominated the early stages, opening the scoring with a controversial goal from Alexis S\u00e1nchez in the fourth minute. On 68 minutes, Victor Moses fell in the Arsenal penalty area under pressure and appealed for a penalty but instead was shown his second yellow card by the referee for diving and was sent off.  In the 76th minute, Diego Costa scored for Chelsea to level the score at 1\u20131: he received the ball from Willian and struck the ball past David Ospina, the Arsenal goalkeeper.  Two minutes later Aaron Ramsey scored with a header past Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois after a cross from Olivier Giroud, who had come on as a substitute less than a minute earlier, to make it 2\u20131 to Arsenal.  After four minutes of stoppage time, the whistle was blown and Arsenal won the FA Cup final 2\u20131, to secure a record 13th title, while Ars\u00e8ne Wenger became the most successful manager in the tournament's history with seven wins.\nWinning the FA Cup would have meant Arsenal qualified for the 2017\u201318 UEFA Europa League group stage had they not already secured their place in the competition after finishing fifth in the 2016\u201317 Premier League.  They also earned the right to play Chelsea who were the Premier League champions for the 2017 FA Community Shield."

        "content": "Arsenal were appearing in the FA Cup final for the 20th time, and for the third time in four years. They had won the cup twelve times, and were beaten finalists seven times; most recently in 2001.  By comparison, Chelsea were making their 12th appearance in a FA Cup final. The club won the cup seven times and lost four finals. The clubs had previously met 13 times in the FA Cup. Arsenal held an advantage in those meetings, winning seven of the last eight; Chelsea won the last FA Cup tie, a 2\u20131 victory in April 2009. This was the second FA Cup final to feature both sides; the first was won by Arsenal in 2002.\nThe most recent meeting between the two teams was a league encounter in February 2017, Chelsea winning by three goals to one, a result which moved them 12 points clear in first position. The victory was significant given that Chelsea had lost the reverse fixture 3\u20130 in September 2016, in what BBC journalist Phil McNulty described as a \"watershed moment\" in their season. While Arsenal struggled to build momentum throughout autumn and winter, Chelsea manager Antonio Conte's tactical switch from 4\u20133\u20133 to 3\u20134\u20133 thereafter resulted in a 13-match winning run. They won the Premier League with two matches to spare, and later set a new divisional record for the most wins (30). \nArsenal ended the season in fifth place, their lowest placing under manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, missing out on UEFA Champions League football for the first time in 20 years. Wenger's future had been cast into doubt following a bad run of form in February and March, which included the team losing 10\u20132 on aggregate against Bayern Munich in the Champions League, the worst aggregate performance by an English club in the history of the tournament.To arrest the decline, Wenger adopted a similar tactical change to Conte, playing three defenders at the back. Arsenal went on to win eight of their last nine fixtures, but Wenger suggested his team were not favourites: \"it's quite even or maybe Chelsea are ahead, so it's a bit similar to what happened in the semi-final against Manchester City. That's part of what makes it all exciting as well.\" Of his future he said, \"It will not be my last match anyway, because I will stay, no matter what happens, in football.\" Former Arsenal player Paul Merson's evaluation was, \"Mertesacker is going to be crucial for Arsenal if he plays; he will have to play very well if Arsenal are to have any chance. If he doesn't play well then Chelsea are going to cut through Arsenal like a knife through butter.\"Conte described Wenger as one of the \"greats\" in football, and felt he would remain as Arsenal manager come the season's end. \"He has done a fantastic job. Sometimes in England I think you undervalue the achievement of qualifying for the Champions League. Only this season they haven't qualified for the Champions League,\" he continued. Conte reiterated the importance of his players keeping their focus and wanted Chelsea to \"pay great attention and focus\" to their opponents. Hazard, who was playing in his first FA Cup final, was eager to win the competition: \"For Chelsea, for such a big club like this, you need to win one, two, three trophies every season if you can. Now we have the possibility to win another trophy so all the players are ready for that. It's such a great competition for the fans.\"\nWhile Chelsea had no injury or suspension worries, Arsenal had doubts over the fitness of Petr \u010cech and Shkodran Mustafi, and were already without defenders Laurent Koscielny (suspension) and Gabriel (ankle injury). Per Mertesacker was expected to start; the Germany international only featured once for Arsenal's first team during the season.  The day before the final The Guardian reported that Wenger chose David Ospina to start in goal ahead of \u010cech.Both clubs received an allocation of approximately 28,000 tickets. For adults, these were priced \u00a345, \u00a365, \u00a385 and \u00a3115, with concessions in place. Chelsea supporters were situated in the west side of the ground, while Arsenal's were allocated in the east.  The remaining 14,000 tickets were distributed to what the FA described as the \"football family which includes volunteers representing counties, leagues, local clubs and charities\". The losing finalist would receive \u00a31.6 million in total prize money while the winners earned a total of \u00a33.4 million. Security at Wembley Stadium was tightened in the wake of the Manchester Arena bombing and Arsenal cancelled a screening of the game at their ground. Both clubs cancelled plans for open top bus victory parades.The game was broadcast live in the United Kingdom by both BBC and BT Sport. BBC One provided the free-to-air coverage and BT Sport 2 was the pay-TV alternative.  It was the first time in the history of the FA Cup that a spidercam was utilised during the match.Sol Campbell and Eddie Newton came onto the pitch to greet the supporters and place the trophy on a plinth. As they departed, the traditional Cup Final hymn, \"Abide with Me\" was sung by representatives of eight clubs, including Lincoln City, Guernsey, Millwall and Sutton United. The teams emerged moments later led by their managers, and players were greeted by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge. Soprano Emily Haig sang the national anthem and a minute's silence was then held to honour the victims of the Manchester attack. Prince William, Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham, and FA chairman Greg Clarke laid wreaths on the pitch in tribute."

Although winning the FA Cup would have secured a 2017\u201318 UEFA Europa League group stage qualification, Arsenal had already qualified for the competition with a fifth-placed finish in the 2016\u201317 Premier League, which saw them fail to qualify for the 2017\u201318 UEFA Champions League. Due to the circumstances surrounding Mertesacker's appearance, and performance on the day, some Arsenal fans and former players have dubbed the game The Mertesacker Final.Welbeck praised his team but refused to be drawn on Wenger's future, saying \"It was a great team performance ... The manager is his own man and he makes his own decision and the board will make the right decision so I can't comment on that.\"   Wenger himself focused on his team's display: \"We had an outstanding performance from the first minute onwards. This team has suffered. They've united and responded.\"  Chelsea goalkeeper Courtois refused to blame Moses for the defeat: \"We are obviously disappointed but I want to say congratulations to Arsenal. They played a good game ... we went down to 10 men and the red card was correct. Victor Moses doesn't need to apologise.\"  Losing manager Conte said he had been surprised by Arsenal and that his side had started poorly: \"Arsenal started very well with great determination. They surprised us a bit but I repeat our first 25 minutes weren't good ... Our season was incredible to win the league in this way, it was great but now its important to look forward and to restart.\""

The debate is broadcast over a series of five programs. At the end of each episode, the panelists vote one title out of the competition until only one book remains. This book is then billed as the book that all of Canada should read.CBC Radio producer Peter Kavanagh proposed the general idea of a national radio book campaign during the fall of 2001. Later that year, Talin Vartanian conceived Canada Reads and created the essential structure of the program: an annual campaign to select a book for the nation to read. She proposed the idea of five panelists, each championing a different title in a national on air debate. Vartanian was producer in the first edition (with Kavanagh), then she became executive producer from 2002 to 2007. In 2007 the program was an \"All Star Edition\", a reunion of the winning panelists from the first five years. From 2007 to 2017, Ann Jansen produced the program.\nCanada Reads was first broadcast on the CBC's Radio One in 2002, and has aired annually on radio since then. The third and fourth editions also were broadcast on television, on CBC Newsworld. Broadcast dates were February 16 to February 20, 2004, and February 21 to February 25, 2005, respectively. The seventh edition was also broadcast on Bold TV, broadcasting from February 25 to February 29. Beginning with the third edition, the daily debates could be heard online as well as on Radio One. The fifth edition was broadcast from April 17 to April 21, 2006. The sixth edition aired February 25 to March 2, 2007. The seventh edition of Canada Reads was broadcast on February 25 to February 29, 2008, and for the first time, it was available as a podcast.\nThe books in the running for each edition of Canada Reads are announced several months before the programs are broadcast. Titles must be Canadian fiction, poetry or plays. They are promoted in bookstores, in the hope that the Canada Reads audience will purchase and read them all before the programs air. In some cases, publishers have published special editions of the nominated titles.\nThe publisher of the winning Canada Reads title donates a portion of sales proceeds from the winning book to a charitable organization working in the field of literacy. Recipients have included Frontier College, the Movement for Canadian Literacy, ABC Life Literacy Canada (formerly ABC CANADA Literacy Foundation) and Laubach Literacy of Canada.\nBeginning in 2004, Radio-Canada, the French-language service of the CBC, produced a French version of Canada Reads entitled Le Combat des livres (\"Battle of the books\"). It was broadcast on Premi\u00e8re Cha\u00eene until 2014, following which it was discontinued for three years until being revived in 2018.\nBoth the English and French programs sometimes, but not always, include one personality more commonly associated with the other language community, who champions a translated work. One advocate, Maureen McTeer,  has appeared on both programs in the same year, championing the same novel in both its original English and translated French editions. Several other novels have also been chosen for both programs, although their English and French versions were not chosen by the same advocate or in the same year; one novel to date, Lawrence Hill's The Book of Negroes (French title Aminata) has won both competitions."

Arlene Dickinson (the panelist defending Prisoner of Tehran) called McKenzie's vote \"the wrong choice for the wrong reason\"."

Even already successful titles see increases in sales driven by their inclusion in the contest: sales of Michael Ondaatje's In the Skin of a Lion increased by 80,000 in 2002, the year of its appearance on Canada Reads. Its publisher, Random House of Canada attributed much of this increase to Canada Reads.The success for lesser known titles can be as marked. Hubert Aquin's Next Episode sold 18,500 copies in the year when it won Canada Reads.For the 2005 edition, sales of Jacques Poulin's Volkswagen Blues, which usually are about 200 copies a year, increased to 7,500 between the time the nominations were announced and the shows began airing. During the same period, 7,000 copies of Frank Parker Day's Rockbound were shipped by its publisher, the University of Toronto Press.Various community groups have also created local events that highlight the Canada Reads shortlist; for instance, the Greater Sudbury Public Library in Sudbury has staged several editions of \"Sudbury Reads\", an event where members of the community discuss and debate that year's Canada Reads titles to arrive at a selection of the city's own favourite Canada Reads book."

In 2007, a listener named John Mutford unsuccessfully attempted to become the first non-celebrity panelist. Critics have also taken issue with the game show format, and have contended that discussion of the books has often remained on a superficial level.The choice of books has also been criticized. Originally each panelist provided a list of five books, from which the producers chose the final contenders. In 2005, this process changed, and each panelist submitted only one choice. Due to scheduling problems, Rufus Wainwright was not able to appear after selecting his choice, and singer Molly Johnson was chosen to defend his chosen book."

Most episodes feature stories of people who have been arrested while travelling abroad, usually for trying to smuggle illegal drugs, although some episodes feature people who were either kidnapped or captured while they were either travelling or living in other countries. Some episodes have featured real-life stories that first became well known when they were made the subject of a film: films that have been 're-made' in this way include Midnight Express, Goodfellas, The Devil's Double, Argo, Mr Nice and, to a lesser extent, Casino (with the story of Frank Cullotta). A few episodes have focused on undercover infiltrations of criminal syndicates by law enforcement agents or individuals recruited by them.\nSince 2006, there have been a total of 13 regular series, plus a special series called Kidnapped Abroad.

It awarded the best in Brazilian music, popular culture and internet culture in the year of 2011.\nFor this edition, the concept has undergone a major makeover; after the happy rock band Restart winning all the 5 categories in which it was indicated in the previous edition by its large number of fans voting exaggeratedly (including Act of the Year), and not by its merit; and also the renewal of the station's programming in 2011, which favored even more the music. Under the awards theme \"A m\u00fasica n\u00e3o para\" (The music never stops), this VMB went to have a 100-member expert jury - the VMB Academy - to choose seven of the 11 awards; three new categories: Best Album, Best Album Art and Best Music; and the indication of many independent artists, like Emicida, Marcelo Jeneci and Criolo, valuing the musical production. However, the VMB didn't neglected the pop artists and web hits, keeping categories as Hit of the Year, Web Hit of the Year and Best International Act, and adding a new category: Best Web Video (Video musics made for internet).[1]\nFor the first time, the VMB was held in a television studio (Quanta Studios), unlike the other editions, which were held in auditoriums such as Credicard Hall and Parque de Conven\u00e7\u00f5es do Anhembi. MTV Brasil considers that its structure was the largest in the history of the awards. And it was still divided into three stages: one for the main show, other for the VMBB (The B-side of VMB) and other for the VIP party - which this time took place simultaneously with the main show, and not after it. The first two stages had different live broadcasts - the main show on TV and Internet, and VMBB exclusively on the Internet. Some presentations of the awards - which had several of the meeting of 30 invited artists - had characterized the artists playing simultaneously and synchronously at the three stages of the event."

The awards ceremony was also moved up from its normal month in June to April to improve participation since many shows were still in production during that time. The Academy also choose to hold the ceremonies at the Warner Bros. Studios instead of a hotel ballroom like in previous years so participants \"would feel [more] comfortable\".

In addition, an equivalent awards ceremony for classical music, called the Classic BRIT Awards, was held annually between 2000 and 2013, before being revived in 2018 but has not been held since.\nThe highest profile music awards ceremony in the UK, the BRIT Awards have featured some of the most notable events in British popular culture, such as the final public appearance of Freddie Mercury, the Jarvis Cocker protest against Michael Jackson, the height of a high-profile feud between Oasis and fellow Britpop band Blur, the Union Jack dress worn by Geri Halliwell of the Spice Girls, and a Chumbawamba member throwing a bucket of iced water over then-Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott. These moments took place in the 1990s when the ceremony had a reputation for being \"a little shambolic, unpredictable and, at times, anarchic\" with a criticism it has lost its edge since then and \"evolved into a more polished, sanitised affair.\"\nThe BRIT Awards were broadcast live until 1989, when Samantha Fox and Mick Fleetwood hosted a widely criticised show in which little went as rehearsed. From 1990 to 2006, the event was recorded and broadcast the following night. From 2007, The BRIT Awards reverted to a live broadcast on British television, on 14 February on ITV. That year, comedian Russell Brand was the host and three awards were dropped from the ceremony: British Rock Act, British Urban Act and British Pop Act. For the last time, on 16 February 2010, Earls Court in London was the venue for The BRITs. The BRIT Awards were held at the O2 Arena in London for the first time in 2011.\nThe BRIT Award statuette given to the winners features Britannia, the female personification of Britain. Since 2011, the statuette has been regularly redesigned by well known British artists, architects, and designers including Vivienne Westwood, Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin, Peter Blake, Zaha Hadid, Anish Kapoor, David Adjaye, Yinka Ilori and Es Devlin, Pam Hogg, Olaolu Slawn and Rachel Jones. In 1992, KLF opened the show and invited extreme metal band Extreme Noise Terror on stage, complete with flame-throwers, and fired machine gun blanks over the crowd. The group sent a dead sheep to the aftershow party, and later buried their BRIT Award statuette at Stonehenge signifying their abhorrence of the music industry. Robbie Williams holds the record for the most BRIT Awards, 13 as a solo artist and another five as part of Take That. Girl group Little Mix made history at the Brit Awards 2021, when they became the first female group to receive the award at the ceremony after 43 years since it was first introduced. In 2024, English singer-songwriter Raye, broke the record for the most nominations received by a single artist in a year with seven in total."

He joked about several controversial topics, such as the death of Jeffrey Epstein, the college admissions scandal, and the middle-aged Leonardo DiCaprio's attraction to younger women. Gervais also jokingly accused the Hollywood Foreign Press of racism for its lack of diversity in the \"in memoriam\" section, mocked Amazon, Apple and Disney for their labor practices, and chastised awardees who talk about their political views in acceptance speeches.Gervais' comments attained mixed reactions across the political spectrum; while conservatives highly praised Gervais, journalists from liberal outlets were more critical, with Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield calling his monologue \"incredibly stale\". Of the criticism, Gervais said it was the \"best ever\", and later defended his jokes in a tweet."

It became the first program to sweep every major category, going 7/7, in Emmy history, until 2020 when Schitt\u2019s Creek repeated the feat. Along with Schitt\u2019s Creek, Caesar's Hour in 1957 and The Crown in 2021, it is one of only four programs to win all four main acting categories.\nUpstart comedy series Arrested Development won Outstanding Comedy Series (being the second time Fox won that specific award) and two other major awards overall.  Its pilot became the twelfth episode to accomplish the directing/writing double.\nAfter years of winning everything but the top prize, The Sopranos finally took home the crown for Outstanding Drama Series, not only knocking off four-time defending champion The West Wing but by being the first cable show, HBO, ever to beat any of the Big Four television networks for that award.  It led all dramas with twelve major nominations and four major wins. One of those wins was for Drea de Matteo for Drama Supporting Actress and, too, was the first time that award went to a cable network.  Furthermore, the cable network also won for the first times in the Comedy Lead Actress and Comedy Supporting Actress categories (Sarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon respectively for Sex and the City).\nEntering its final ceremony, five-time series champion Frasier needed five major wins to tie The Mary Tyler Moore Show's record of 27 major wins. Because it was only nominated in three major categories, breaking the record was not possible. Though it did not tie the record, Frasier finished its Emmy career on a high note, winning two major awards, the most it had won since 1998. Its 25 major wins put it at second of all time. When adding its wins in technical categories, its total rises to 37, the most for any comedy series."

In February 1993, actor and comedian Billy Crystal was chosen by Cates as host also for the fourth straight time. Cates justified the decision to hire him saying, \"He is a major movie star with a talent for moving the evening's entertainment along.\" According to an article by Army Archerd published in Variety, Crystal initially declined to host again citing his busy film schedule that included Mr. Saturday Night and City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold. However, after Cates sent him a funeral wreath with a poem declaring \"The show and I are dead without you\" followed by a head of a fake dead horse similar to one featured in the film The Godfather, Crystal accepted the role as emcee.As with previous ceremonies he produced, Cates centered the show around a theme. Inspired by the Year of the Woman in which a record four women were elected to the United States Senate, Cates christened the 1993 show with the theme \"Oscar Celebrates Women and the Movies\". In tandem with the theme, AMPAS gathered 67 female Oscar winners of every category for a photo that was later shown at the start of the telecast. Actress and singer Liza Minnelli performed \"Ladies' Day\", a song written by Fred Ebb and John Kander specifically for the broadcast.

The show again moved to Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre in 2002 due to the impending closure of Wembley Arena for reconstruction, where it is now held every October. The event has become larger and more complex each year in its larger venue, including the introduction in 2003 of an extensive Equestrian Retail Village.\nIts purpose was to be a 'champion of champions' Show, and originally took the best from showing and show jumping competitions throughout the year. Nowadays HOYS allocates showing qualifiers to Societies and Shows and the Champions of these qualifiers compete at HOYS to be crowned the Champion of Champions. British Showjumping allocates the National Showjumping qualifiers  Over 120 county and equestrian shows in Great Britain host qualifiers for this huge indoor event.Due in part to its standards of competition and its placement at the end of equestrian year, the show has become a widely known in the UK and the worldThe show runs every October and incorporates a full programme of international show jumping, the British National Show Jumping finals, Showing Finals and a range of displays and entertainment including the Pony Club Mounted Games for the Prince Philip Cup.In 1997 the then promoters of HOYS went bankrupt. Grandstand Media Ltd were based at Wembley and with help from the shows existing supporters, officials and sponsors the show went on that year under Grandstand Media Ltd.  Following the 1997 show, Grandstand Media obtained a long license from British Showjumping to run the show in its entirety  and they have since revitalised the presentation and content including a special celebration in 1998 to commemorate the fiftieth show. Horse of the Year Show remains a National Institution, the finale to the showing year and the climax to the domestic show jumping year2002 saw HOYS move from Wembley Arena, its home for over 40 years to the NEC Arena, Birmingham. Logistically this was very complicated as the show takes up over 50 acres (200,000 m2) of the NEC complex, but with record attendance figures and outstanding competition it was described by Horse & Hound as a 'Triumph' and was heralded a resounding success with sell out performances throughout the show. Since the move to the NEC HOYS has developed and expanded experiencing record numbers visit the Show every yearEach year, the Sunday Gala Night concludes with Ronald Duncan's emotive poem The Horse; this was read by Simon MacCorkindale until 2010. Monty Roberts has described the Horse of the Year Show as the \"Best in the world. It is the \"World's Most Famous Horse Show\".\nFor many years, the event was televised by the BBC which attracted large audiences but was shown on Sky Sports in the recent years. By 2016, it had moved to Horse & Country TV."

The Filmfare ceremony is one of the most famous film events in India. The awards were introduced by the Filmfare magazine of The Times Group in 1954, the same year as the National Film Awards. They were initially referred to as the \"Clare Awards\" or \"The Clares\" after Clare Mendon\u00e7a, the editor of The Times of India and modelled after the Academy Awards.\nA dual voting system was developed in 1956. Under this system, in contrast to the National Film Awards, which are decided by a panel appointed by the Indian Government, the Filmfare Awards are voted on by both the public and a committee of experts. The ceremony has been sponsored by various private organisations in the past as well as in present provisions. During several years in the 1990s, a live ceremony was broadcast to television audiences but was later discontinued due to unknown reasons.\nSince 2001, a recorded and edited version of the awards ceremony was televised on SET a week or two after the ceremony has been held. Since 2018, the ceremony has been televised on Colors. Until 2023, the function was held in Mumbai except for year 2020 when the 65th Filmfare Awards event was held on 16 February 2020 at Sarusajai Stadium, Guwahati.\nUntil the mid-1990s, Filmfare Awards were the preeminent and most-recognised awards in Bollywood until several other awards sprouted up in Mumbai. This has resulted in poor viewership since the 2000s.In addition to the flagship event, Filmfare also has variants for other Indian film industries, such as Filmfare Awards South for South Indian cinema; Filmfare Marathi Awards for Marathi cinema; Filmfare Awards East for Bengali cinema, Assamese cinema, and Odia cinema; Filmfare Awards Punjabi for Punjabi cinema; Filmfare OTT Awards for over-the-top films, Filmfare Short Film Awards for short films; and Filmfare Style & Glamour Awards."

But as of 2014, a huge change was made to give the trophy a 3-D look. There were two reasons given for this change. First, that the organisers believe that it was necessary to match the many advances in technology in today's world, which will advance a lot more in the coming years as well. This was also an attempt to match the theme of the 2013 set of awards at Filmfare in Mumbai: a hundred years leap into the future."

The Creative Arts Emmy Awards for prime time were hosted by Kathy Griffin on September 12.After the previous year's lackluster performance in ratings, the Primetime Emmy Awards were hoping to achieve success by selecting Harris as sole host, as opposed to a group of hosts as in the previous year. The 61st Primetime Emmy Awards earned a 4.2 rating in the 18\u201349 demo and drew 13.3 million, 1.1 million more than the previous year's all-time low.30 Rock became the sixth show to win Outstanding Comedy Series three consecutive years, winning three major awards on that night. 30 Rock made history when it smashed the record for most major nominations by a comedy series with 18. The Cosby Show had held the record of 13 since 1986, while 30 Rock had tied this the previous year. The 18 major nominations became the third biggest record of all time, behind Roots' record number of 21 in 1977 and NYPD Blue's mark of 19 in 1994. These records still stand.\nThe drama field also crowned the defending champion, AMC's Mad Men. It won two major awards on that night. After airing for fifteen seasons, ER went out a winner as its series finale won for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series. This was the first major win for ER since 2001.\nCherry Jones became the first from a Fox network show to win the award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama series but also the second female ever from Fox to win a Major Acting award since Gillian Anderson in 1997.\nHistory was also made by The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Amazing Race. Both programs won their series categories for the seventh straight year, this broke the record for most consecutive victories in a major category of six that was held by The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Cagney & Lacey. The Amazing Race would lose the following year. However, in 2013, The Daily Show's streak was finally snapped by The Colbert Report, after a record of ten consecutive wins."

The Awards, without a host for the third consecutive year, were broadcast by NBC for the first time in 11 years.\nGeorge C. Scott, winner of Best Actor for Patton, became the first actor to decline an Oscar, having previously protested his nomination for Best Supporting Actor for The Hustler (1961) and quoted as saying that the Academy Awards were \"a two-hour meat parade, a public display with contrived suspense for economic reasons.\" He also maintained that it was \"degrading for actors to compete against one another.\" Co-star Karl Malden agreed, but felt that Scott could have made his denunciation more subtly.With her Best Supporting Actress win for Airport, Helen Hayes became the first performer to win Oscars in both lead and supporting categories (having won Best Actress 38 years before for The Sin of Madelon Claudet). Her win set a record for the biggest gap between acting wins, subsequently broken by Katharine Hepburn (48 years between her first and last wins).\nThe documentary film Woodstock garnered three Oscar nominations, making it the most nominated documentary film in Oscar history (its record was later tied by Flee, 51 years later).\nThis was the only time since the 6th Academy Awards that all five nominees for Best Actress were first-time nominees, and was the last time that either lead acting category was entirely composed of new nominees until the 95th Academy Awards. It was also the first time since the 7th Academy Awards in which none of the nominees for the Best Actor had a previous nomination in that category.\nAs of 2023, this is the most recent ceremony in which the 4 highest-grossing films of the year were nominated for Best Picture (Love Story, Airport, M*A*S*H and Patton)."

Nicasio grabbed the mic and said \"My name is Zacari Nicasio. Shout out to Kevin Gates he has an album; Yeezy jumped over the jumpman yes sir...\" Shortly after Nicasio grabbed the mic, Sharon Osbourne kicked him twice, and then Sheryl Underwood told Niciasio \"You ain't gonna pull no Steve Harvey up in here [no] no sir, no sir. Security!\" After Gilbert continued her speech, Aisha Tyler joked about the incident when Gilbert said they are the \"M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce of misfits\" which Tyler replied \"But that guy is not in our club.\" Osbourne added to the joke saying \"Get the **** off my stage!\" Osbourne also flipped off Nicasio twice as he was taken away by security during Gilbert's speech. Julie Chen told Entertainment Tonight moments after the incident \"[Osbourne] always said you mess with one of us you mess with all of us.\" The incident was heavily talked about on their show following the awards. After ranting about his behavior, Osbourne warned him on The Talk, \u201cIf I see him again, I'd kick him again!\" Tyler told him to \"practice yo speech in the bathroom dude\" if he was going interrupt an award show and also mocked his speech on the show as well saying \"Imma give a shout out to Spooky and them and I like cheese sandwiches.\" Gilbert said about being interrupted \"When he first came up I just thought oh somebody's trying to steal the spotlight and it's kinda funny even though it's not right because we wanna speak to our fans and you know all of that. But there was something amusing about it. When it was unintelligible I got scared there was something wrong with him.\" Underwood also mentioned on The Talk that Harvey gave Underwood permission to use that joke because she had been saying it a lot and didn't want to hurt his feelings as he is a personal friend of Underwood. Underwood also stated she almost pushed Nicasio off the stage but she didn't as she feared of a lawsuit saying \"When our boy was coming up to the stage I was like 'Oh hell no' and then I thought if I got on this dude and knocked him down the stairs then maybe its a lawsuit and we all get sued and network close down. For then I thought if I strong-armed the dude and kinda push him off and get him out of here.\"Niciasio had no remorse over the incident but asked Osbourne to apologize and take him to dinner at The Cheesecake Factory.On March 3, 2016, Gilbert, Underwood, and Osbourne brought up the incident again on The Talk during their conversation of a woman defending herself at gunpoint in a convenience store. Glibert said \"I was thinking about [the woman defending herself] when I was watching how I would react and then I realized how I would react because we had it not a criminal situation but the guy [Niciasio] that came up during the People's Choice Awards. You two [Osbourne and Underwood] were kicking [Niciasio] off the stage and I was scared and just went quiet. You know I would just shut down and hand him the money.\" Osbourne joked \"We were just scared that [Niciasio] was gonna sing. That would have been much scarier.\"\nOn June 13, 2016, Sara Gilbert brought up the incident again with Mike Epps who was a guest on The Talk.\nIronically, six months prior to the awards, Tyler was asked by Jason Derulo at the 2015 Ubisoft E3 press conference to dance with him after Tyler remarked that she was glad to not dance up there with him as she pointed out she is not a good dancer. Derulo jokingly was disappointed that Tyler didn't crash his performance.\n\n\n== References =="

        "content": "Due to the negative reception received from the preceding year's ceremony, actor Billy Crystal announced that after overseeing four consecutive Oscar ceremonies, he would not be hosting the 1994 telecast. In a statement released by his publicist, he stated, \"After three Grammys, four Oscars and six Comic Reliefs, I'm going to take a break from my hosting duties. I always felt honored to host the show and did my best to carry on the tradition of Bob Hope and Johnny Carson. I hope the new host has as good a time as I did.\" With Crystal absent to host the Oscars, many media outlets wondered whom producer Gil Cates would hire to emcee the program. Film columnist Jack Matthews suggested that actor Tom Hanks, who would eventually win Best Actor for Philadelphia, should host the show writing that he \"has charm, dignity, wit, intelligence and, it's worth mentioning, he's a movie star!\" Cates also offered the role to performers Steve Martin, Bette Midler, and Johnny Carson, but they all turned down the opportunity.After several days of speculation, Cates announced that he hired Oscar-winning actress and comedian Whoopi Goldberg to host the festivities for the first time. By virtue of her selection, Goldberg became both the first African American to host as well as the first woman to host the telecast solo. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Cates explained the decision to hire her saying, \"She is a highly recognizable star who has millions of fans.\" He also addressed the media's concerns regarding Goldberg's raunchy and outspoken humor stating, \"Some people may think she's potentially dangerous, and she says things that come to her mind. It's going to be exciting for me. The main thing is she wants to do it and she's smart. Whatever she says will be appropriate.\" Goldberg expressed that she was thrilled to be selected to emcee the 1994 ceremony commenting, \"To go from watching to winning to hosting in one lifetime is major.\"As with previous ceremonies he produced, Cates centered the show around a theme. This year, he christened the show with the theme \"People Behind the Camera\" commenting that \"It will be a salute to those unseen men and women who make what we see on the screen, the artist and craftspeople responsible for the magic of the movies.\" In tandem with the theme, the ceremony's opening number featured a montage produced by Chuck Workman saluting the many individuals such as directors, editors, and composers who are involved in moviemaking. During that segment, singer Bernadette Peters performing a modified version of Stephen Sondheim's song \"Putting It Together\" from his musical Sunday in the Park with George. Filmmaker and editor Carol A. Streit assembled another montage featuring a salute to the work of cinematographers and their contributions to film.Several other people and elements were also involved with the production of the ceremony. Production designer Roy Christopher designed a new stage for the ceremony which prominently featured five giant Oscar statues each flanked inside metal cones that were illuminated recurrently throughout the show. Film composer and musician Bill Conti served as musical director of the ceremony. Dancer Debbie Allen choreographed a dancer number showcasing the Best Original Score nominees featuring eight prestigious ballet and dance troupes from around the world."

Twenty songs competed in the Big Artists section and eight songs competed in the Newcomers'  section; both competitive sections ran concurrently with each other over the five evenings. All songs in the competition were required to be new compositions performed in the Italian language with some exceptions for words and phrases in other dialects/languages. The songs were performed in the competition live and accompanied by an orchestra.The twenty entries competing in the Big Artists section were presented during the first and second evenings on 9 and 10 February. Ten songs were performed during each evening and were voted upon by a press jury (50%) and public televote (50%) with no eliminations occurring during either evening. All twenty songs advanced to the fourth evening, the semi-final, and faced an additional vote consisting of public televoting (40%), an expert jury (30%) and an demoscopic poll (30%). The weighted average of the votes from the first and second evenings as well as the votes from the fourth evening produced a total ranking of all of the songs. Based on this ranking, the top fifteen entries qualified to the final on the fifth evening on 13 February. The bottom five entries from the fourth evening entered a repechage round and faced an additional public televote to determine the one entry that would be readmitted to compete in the final; the other four entries were eliminated.

The results of both rounds of voting were determined by public televoting (40%), an expert jury (30%) and an demoscopic poll (30%). An additional competition among the performers competing in the Big Artists section occurred during the third evening where each act performed a cover of an Italian song or an international hit translated into Italian. The best cover, as determined by the equal combination of votes from a press jury and a public televote, was awarded with a prize.The eight entries competing in the Newcomers'  section were divided into four semi-final duels consisting of two songs each.

Many of the further presentations and host commentary continued jokes aimed towards Trump, along with winners' speeches criticizing the President and standing behind diversity in the television field. Sean Spicer, Trump's former White House Press Secretary, made an appearance in which he parodied himself.

But after what an email to members called \"an unprecedented cry out\" from its membership, the BFCA's board of directors called a \"special referendum\" on adding the movie to the ten candidates for Best Picture, which it won. (A similar situation happened for the 6th Critics' Choice Awards in 2001, in which the film Cast Away was voted by referendum to be included among the nominees for Best Picture.) The BFCA faced immediate criticism, including from its own members, over what many saw as an attempt to increase ratings for the awards ceremony's broadcast on A&E (which, is 50% owned by Disney, the company behind Star Wars) on January 17, 2016. Two members\u2014Eric Melin (editor-in-chief of Scene-Stealers.com, a film critic of Lawrence Journal-World, and the president of the Kansas City Film Critics Circle) and Scott Renshaw (editor of Salt Lake City Weekly)\u2014resigned in protest.\n\nMelin, in an open letter, wrote: \"In order for a professional critics body to have integrity, nomination and voting guidelines must be consistent with the way they were laid out at the beginning of the process. Nominating Star Wars: The Force Awakens for Best Picture does not follow those guidelines, and re-ignites a loophole for this kind of thing to happen every year... Unlike the other nominations, this was not decided upon using a weighted ballot of all possibilities, and it smells like a desperate ploy to get better TV ratings. Additionally, your insistence on billing the Critic's Choice Awards as the 'most accurate predictor of the Academy Awards' is antithetical to the purpose of having a 'critic's choice' award at all. The awards should not serve as another TV marketing arm to the studios. Rather, it should represent the views and opinions of film critics, which is a very different group from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. As film criticism continues to be devalued and the lines between journalist, critic, and studio shill continue to be blurred, the only thing we have is our integrity, and this smacks of a marketing ploy. Believe me, I know because my day job is a social media marketer. What I am not is an employee of A&E Networks, and the only thing I have as a lowly paid film critic is the courage of my convictions.\"\nSimilarly, in another open letter, Renshaw wrote: \"This decision has been a long time coming, but was made inevitable by the decision to change the voting process to allow Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens to be included as a nominee after the official nominating deadline. Irrespective of any precedent that may be invoked... it is obvious to me that this decision is based more on its marketing value than making sure that the best films are included. If that were the case, the entire nomination process would have been opened up again to allow The Force Awakens to be considered in all categories. Any suggestion that this decision was made primarily for any reason other than to improve ratings for the awards broadcast feels disingenuous at best. An awards voting body has nothing to stand on but its integrity. I no longer feel my own personal integrity is consistent with ongoing membership in this organization.\""

        "content": "The Political Cesspool is a weekly far-right talk radio show founded by Tennessean political activist James Edwards and syndicated by the organizations Liberty News Radio Network and Accent Radio Network in the United States. First broadcast in October 2004 twice a week from radio station WMQM, per Edwards it has been simulcast on Stormfront Radio, a service of the white nationalist Stormfront website and as of 2011 is broadcast on Saturday nights on WLRM, a blues and southern soul radio station in Millington, Tennessee. Its sponsors include the white separatist Council of Conservative Citizens and the Institute for Historical Review, a Holocaust denial group.According to its statement of principles, the show stands for the \"Dispossessed Majority\" and represents \"a philosophy that is pro-White.\" It has attracted criticism\u2014including from The Nation, The New Republic, the Stephen Roth Institute, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), and the Anti-Defamation League\u2014for its promotion of anti-semitic, white nationalist and white supremacist views. According to the SPLC, the show has featured a \"Who's Who of the radical right\", including members of the Ku Klux Klan; they say Edwards has probably done more than anyone in America to promote neo-Nazis, Holocaust deniers and other extremists.The show features Edwards and his co-hosts Keith Alexander, Bill Rolen, Winston Smith, and Eddie Miller, as well as producer Art Frith. Former staffers include Geoff Melton, Jess Bonds and co-founder Austin Farley. Its guests have included author Jerome Corsi, Minuteman Project leader Jim Gilchrist, former Constitution Party presidential candidate Michael Peroutka, actor Sonny Landham, British National Party leader Nick Griffin, Vermont secessionist Thomas Naylor, and paleoconservative activist Pat Buchanan. It is carried by at least three licensed terrestrial radio stations in the United States and on network feeds on the Galaxy 19 communications satellite."

        "content": "The Political Cesspool describes its philosophy as \"pro-White\" and \"against political centralization\". Its statement of principles, with material borrowed from the Council of Conservative Citizens, reads:\n\nThe Political Cesspool Radio Program stands for The Dispossessed Majority. We represent a philosophy that is pro-White and are against political centralization. You can trust The Political Cesspool to give you the \"other side of the news\"\u2014to report on events which are vital to your welfare but which would otherwise be hushed up or distorted by the controlled press.\nWe make no attempt to give you \"both sides.\" We'll leave the establishment side to your daily newspaper, television and other radio shows. We will bring to you some of the most renowned thinkers, writers, pundits, activists, entertainers and elected officials each broadcast as our guests. Furthermore, we pledge that The Political Cesspool will correct any meaningful error or fact. Make up your own mind who is being honest with you: the establishment media or The Political Cesspool Radio Program.\n\nThe United States government should be independent of any international organization of governments and American law should not be imposed by organizations such as the United Nations.\nAmerica would not be as prosperous, ruggedly individualistic, and a land of opportunity if the founding stock were not Europeans.\nSince family is the foundation of any strong society, we are against feminism, abortion, and primitivism.\nPrivate property rights are inviolable. They come from our God-given right to life.\nWe wish to revive the White birthrate above replacement level fertility and beyond to grow the percentage of Whites in the world relative to other races.\nIssues such as education, environmental law, and police should be decentralized down to the lowest level to insure natural rights and efficiency.\nSecession is a right of all people and individuals. It was successful in 1776 and this show honors those who tried to make it successful in 1865.\nWe are cultural conservatives because we have certain morals to which we adhere. We are against homosexuality, vulgarity, loveless sex, and masochism.\nWe wish for American government to stop interfering politically, militarily, and socially outside of the borders of the United States of America. We want non-interventionism."

        "content": "The Political Cesspool has over the years featured many guest appearances, including political activists, Holocaust deniers, economists, and musicians. Former Tennessee gubernatorial candidate Carl \"Twofeathers\" Whitaker, who claims partial Native-American ancestry and is known for his strong support of the Minuteman movement, has appeared on the show, as has conservative Native-American activist David Yeagley. Filmmakers Merlin Miller (A Place to Grow, Jericho), who was the 2012 presidential nominee of the American Third Position (now known as the American Freedom Party), and Craig Bodeker (A Conversation about Race) have featured.Author Jerome Corsi was interviewed in July 2008. During the discussion he spoke about his financial newsletter, and promoted his book The Obama Nation, which includes several statements that have been widely described as racist; for example, he opined that US President Barack Obama identifies more with his \"African blood\" than his American roots and that the President \"rejects everyone white, including his mother and his grandparents\". Corsi scheduled another promotional appearance on The Political Cesspool, but one month later he canceled this appearance, citing \"travel plans that changed\". Edwards said that he believed the incident \"just goes to show what incredible pressure everyone in public life is under to never have anything to do with anyone who speaks up for the interests of white people.\" Fellow authors John Derbyshire and Steve Sailer have also been guests. In July 2011, WorldNetDaily columnist Ilana Mercer appeared on the show.Constitution Party nominee Michael Peroutka used his appearance in 2004 to promote his presidential campaign.  Party member Michael Goza described the show as \"Christian/Constitutionalist\", and \"a great blessing to our cause\". Thomas Naylor, of the Vermont secessionist organization Second Vermont Republic, appeared on the show to celebrate Confederate History Month in April 2007, while American Freedom Party Chairman Bill Johnson appeared to promote his party.On May 8, 2006, Minuteman Project leader Jim Gilchrist spoke on the program. Co-host Bill Rolen agreed with Gilchrist's view that illegal immigrants' intentions are to \"just squat here and plunder whatever social benefits our programs provide them\". However, Rolen disagreed with Gilchrist's claim that illegal immigration was \"the 21st century slave trade\". Gilchrist's colleague in the Minuteman movement, Chris Simcox, has also been a guest of the show.Paul Babeu, the sheriff of Pinal County, Arizona, appeared on The Political Cesspool on July 10, 2010 to discuss illegal immigration; during the interview, he referred to James Edwards as a \"great American\". Less than two weeks later, Babeu's spokesman issued an apology, saying that he had not researched the show thoroughly enough before scheduling the interview and that Babeu has a policy of not conducting interviews with hate groups. Babeu himself said that he was \"hoodwinked\" into appearing on the show and that he rejects \"any hate or bigotry\". Prior to the interview, cohost Eddie Miller said that \"Of all the people we've interviewed on this radio show, I would say the only people that came close to getting me this excited was Dr. David Duke.\" Following Babeu's spokesman's apology, Edwards alleged that Babeu was aware of the show's true ideology prior to appearing on the show, saying: \"For Sheriff Babeu to change his mind and now regret coming on our show, for whatever reason, is his right. For him to act as though he had no idea of our ideology is a lie.\" As a result of the controversy surrounding Babeu's appearance on the show, Arizona U.S. Senate candidate J. D. Hayworth asked his primary opponent, John McCain, to drop several campaign ads featuring McCain and Babeu. In 2011, another sheriff, Dennis Spruell of Montezuma County, Colorado, also apologized after appearing on the show without knowing its actual agenda.\n\nPaleoconservative activist and former presidential candidate Pat Buchanan has appeared twice as of 2011. In a June 2008 interview initiated and arranged by his publicist, he promoted his book Churchill, Hitler and the Unnecessary War. During the broadcast, Buchanan defended Charles Lindbergh against charges of antisemitism, stating that his reputation \"has been blackened because of a single speech he gave and a couple of paragraphs in it where he said that ... the Jewish community is beating the drums for war but frankly, no one has said what he said was palpably untrue.\" At the end of the interview, James Edwards said, \"Mr. Buchanan, thank you so much for coming back on our program, for fighting for our people.\" Previously, in September 2006, Buchanan had made an appearance to promote his book State of Emergency; during this interview, he said that \"we are being invaded by people of different cultures\" and argued that Americans \"cannot survive a bifurcated culture or a heavily Hispanicized culture, tilted towards Mexico ... I think that's the beginning of the end of the United States.\"\nSelf-proclaimed \"racial realist\" Jared Taylor, whom James Edwards considers to be a close friend, has appeared on at least ten occasions. Although describing itself as \"America First\", the show has also hosted foreign guests, including Croatian white nationalist Tomislav Suni\u0107, Australian white nationalist Drew Fraser, Russian Austrian School economist Yuri N. Maltsev, British lawyer Adrian Davies, Canadian white supremacist Paul Fromm, Canadian conservative blogger Kathy Shaidle, and British National Party (BNP) leaders Simon Darby and Nick Griffin; Griffin appeared as a guest before and after his election to the European Parliament. During his post-election appearance, Griffin attributed the BNP's electoral successes to a fear of \"creeping process of Islamification\".Actor Mel Gibson's father, Hutton Gibson, has also appeared on the show. During his appearance, he referred to Pope Benedict XVI as a \"homosexual\" and claimed that \"half the people in the Vatican are queer.\""

The Political Cesspool was added to the Southern Poverty Law Center's hate group watch list in 2006. James Edwards was \"ecstatic\", saying \"I don't think you've arrived in the conservative movement until you've made it to the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hate Watch\". Edwards describes the SPLC as a group composed of \"communists and civil rights hustlers\". The SPLC's Hatewatch has referred to The Political Cesspool as \"an overtly racist, anti-Semitic radio show hosted by [a] self-avowed white nationalist\" and as \"the nexus of hate in America\". The Anti-Defamation League has also criticized the show; Edwards has attacked the ADL as \"America's most powerful hate group\" and has claimed that its definition of a \"neo-Nazi [is] any white person who disagrees with a Jew\".Author John Avlon, a former speechwriter for Rudy Giuliani, has described The Political Cesspool as \"avowedly white supremacist\".\nMax Blumenthal, who reported on an attempt by one of the show's staff to advertise at a rally for Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, described The Political Cesspool as having a \"racist ideology\", and highlighted anti-Semitic, racist, and homophobic comments that Edwards had made on his blog. The Stephen Roth Institute has also commented on the show, noting that \"[James] Edwards openly espoused many of his guests' views and during speeches to extremist audiences, including members of the white supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens and the racist League of the South, he gained the support of a wide array of extremists.\" In an article about antisemitism in Belgium, the Institute commented on the show's interview with Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian Parliament and a leader of the extremist Vlaams Belang movement.Newsweek used one of Winston Smith's statements to argue that the rise in popularity of white nationalism and supremacy is due to the combination of the late-2000s recession and the election of a black president. Many such groups have been attempting to gain new recruits and increase their political influence by rebranding themselves as defenders of \"white heritage\" while de-emphasizing their dislike of minorities and Jews. Smith states, \"[t]he emphasis is different now. We don't talk as much about what blacks have done to us; we're more focused on ourselves and our own culture.\""

These new rules are:\n\nAll voters eligible for a category's nominations are now eligible to vote in that category, providing that they have seen the submitted material and attest to no specific conflicts of interest.\nThe number of nominees in the Outstanding Drama Series and Outstanding Comedy Series categories will expand from six nominees to seven, due to the increase in series production.\nTo clarify the difference between a Comedy series and a Drama series, any show where episodes average a length of 30 minutes is eligible to enter as a comedy and series with episodes that average a length of 1 hour is eligible as a drama. There may be exceptions to the rules, however: producers may formally petition to a new Academy panel to have the show be considered for the alternative category. This panel, consisting of five industry leaders appointed by the Academy chairman and four appointees from the Board of Governors, will vote on a decision. A two-thirds vote was required for the show to be considered for the alternative category. So far, three petitions have been successful: Glee, Jane the Virgin, and Shameless were voted as eligible for \"Outstanding Comedy Series\".\nThe Outstanding Miniseries was renamed as \"Outstanding Limited Series\". A \"Limited Series\" is defined as a program consisting of two or more episodes totaling 150 minutes as a whole, tell a complete, non-recurring story, and do not have an ongoing storyline and/or main characters in subsequent seasons.\nA \"Guest Actor\" is now defined as a performer appearing in less than 50% of the program's episodes. Only performers that fit this criterion are allowed to submit.\nThe Outstanding Variety Series category has been split into two separate categories: \"Outstanding Variety Talk\" and \"Outstanding Variety Sketch\"."

Although Szubanski indicated that it was a \"beat-up\" and that she \"couldn't care less,\" Sandilands was still suspended.In July 2011, Sandilands made headlines after stating that Australian model Megan Gale was a \"phony\" and that he \"never liked her\". Gale's management responded by cancelling Gale's upcoming interview on the show. Later that week, model Charlotte Dawson hit out at Sandilands on her Twitter account, saying that he could \"f*** off\".In August 2011, Sandilands faced criticism from the Indian community over comments he made on the show about the cleanliness of the Ganges River. The Universal Society of Hinduism later admitted that there was no malice behind Sandilands's comments and accepted his reasoning.\nIn November 2011, Sandilands used his radio show to launch abuse at Daily Telegraph columnist Alison Henderson, for her negative review of the Kyle & Jackie O TV show (which had performed poorly in the ratings). Sandilands called Henderson a \"fat slag\" and a \"piece of shit\", accused the columnist of bias because \"she just hates us and has always hated us\", before making more derogatory comments about her body. The ACMA investigation into the show imposed further restrictions on 2DayFM, meaning that the radio station would be in breach if any broadcast made statements to demean women or girls.In May 2016, legal action was launched against Jackie O and the Australian Radio Network, after Jackie O questioned the parentage of NRL player Kieran Foran's son on air. Jackie O made the claim in late April, after it was revealed that Foran had checked into a mental health clinic, and had been granted indefinite leave from his club. Rugby league writer, Danny Weidler responded at the time \"The suggestion from Jackie O on Kiis1065 that Kieran Foran's baby boy is not his is false and offensive to all concerned\". The legal demand instructed the show to make a full retraction of the defamatory allegation against Foran and his ex-partner, and issue an unreserved apology."

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button received the most nominations with thirteen (the ninth film to garner that many nominations); Slumdog Millionaire came in second with ten.

Slumdog Millionaire was the eleventh film to win Best Picture without any acting nominations. Sean Penn became the ninth person to win Best Lead Actor twice. Best Supporting Actor winner Heath Ledger became the second performer to win a posthumous acting Oscar. The first actor to receive this distinction was Peter Finch, who posthumously won Best Actor for Network two months after his death in January 1977. Coincidentally, both actors were the first native Australians to win Oscars in their respective categories. With its six nominations, WALL\u2022E tied with 1991's Beauty and the Beast as the most nominated animated film in Oscar history."

        "content": "Due to the declining viewership of the recent Academy Awards ceremonies, AMPAS had contracted an entirely new production team in an attempt to revive interest surrounding both the awards and festivities. In September 2008, the Academy selected producers Bill Condon and Laurence Mark to co-produce the telecast. Nearly three months later, actor Hugh Jackman, who had previously emceed three consecutive Tony Awards ceremonies between 2003 and 2005, was chosen as host of the 2009 gala. Jackman expressed his anticipation of the awards in the few days preceding, and had commented that he was thrilled with preparations for the ceremony.Notable changes were introduced in the production of the telecast. In an attempt to build suspense and curiosity leading up to the awards, Condon and Mark announced that they would not reveal any of the presenters or performers who would participate in the Oscarcast. Another unique feature of the ceremony was that the orchestra performed onstage instead of being relegated to a pit. In a break from previous presentations, five previous Oscar-winning performers presented each of the acting categories as opposed to only one or two. In addition, the Academy announced that for the first time since Oscar began broadcasting on television, film studios would be able to televise advertisements promoting their upcoming films. Furthermore, a montage of upcoming 2009 films was shown over the ceremony's closing credits.Several other people participated in the production of the ceremony. Chris Harrison hosted \"Road to the Oscars\", a weekly behind-the-scenes video blog on the Oscar ceremony website. David Rockwell designed a new set and stage design for the ceremony. Film historian and author Robert Osborne greeted guests entering the festivities at the Hollywood and Highland Center. Film director Judd Apatow filmed a comedy montage which featured Seth Rogen and James Franco reprising their roles from Pineapple Express. Director Baz Luhrmann produced a song and dance number saluting movie musicals.Peter Gabriel, who was originally scheduled to perform his nominated song \"Down to Earth\" from WALL-E during the live broadcast, declined to perform after learning that he would be allowed to sing only 65 seconds of the song during the ceremony's Best Original Song nominee performances. Gabriel still attended the ceremony but singer John Legend, backed by the Soweto Gospel Choir, performed the song in place of Gabriel."

With all the extraordinary events that are taking place today, it's wonderful that we can still get away to see a film.\"A month before the festivities, Cates recruited actor and comedian Billy Crystal to host the ceremony for the third straight year. According to Variety columnist Army Archerd, Crystal planned to perform a bungee jump stunt as part of his entrance at the beginning of the ceremony. However, the act was scrapped due to high insurance costs for the Academy and Crystal coming down with the flu. Instead, Crystal, who was wearing Hannibal Lecter's mask from The Silence of the Lambs, was hauled onto the stage by two men.Several other people were involved in the production of the ceremony. Choreographer Debbie Allen supervised the Best Song nominee performances and the Best Original Score dance number. Film composer and musician Bill Conti served as musical director of the ceremony.

They decide to visit it for its grand opening, but discover Doobner is actually Sideshow Bob, having left Italy alongside his wife, Francesca, and son, Gino, and created the restaurant and the commercial to lure the Simpsons into a trap. After tying up the Simpsons, Bob then reveals a large stack of crates filled with dynamite, with which he will kill them, using a laptop with a defective battery as a detonator once it overheats and explodes. While gloating, Bob incorrectly quotes a phrase from Macbeth and Lisa corrects him. Bob tries to look up the correct phrase on Wikipedia, but the laptop explodes in Bob's hands, and he is then arrested and taken to court.\nDuring Bob's trial, his father, Doctor Robert Terwilliger Sr., is brought to testify. He explains Bob has a rare heart condition and also suggests that Bob is insane because of his long-standing feud with Bart. Since all of the audience have been tormented by Bart's pranks, Bob convinces Springfield Bart is ultimately to blame and they all turn on him. As Bart pleads his innocence, Bob takes out a vial labeled nitroglycerin, which everyone thinks is a deadly explosive. However, as Bart throws the vial away to save everyone, it is revealed to actually be Bob's heart medication as he collapses to the floor and is pronounced dead.\nBob's entire family attends the funeral: his mother, Dame Judith Onderdonk, a well-known Shakespearean actress; his father; his brother Cecil, who has been let out of prison for the occasion; and Francesca and Gino, along with many regular Springfieldians. Feeling slightly guilty, Bart speaks to Cecil, who convinces him to go to the funeral home to make peace with Bob before he is cremated. However, when Bart arrives, Bob rises out of the coffin, alive and well, and traps Bart in it to be incinerated.\nMeanwhile, Milhouse inadvertently makes Lisa realize that everything was an elaborate plot put together by Bob and his family: with his mother being a Shakespearean actress, Bob would have known Shakespeare too well to have accidentally misquoted him and must have done so intentionally in order to get caught and go to trial, where his father used a special drug to put him in a death-like state. Cecil helped by playing to Bart's guilty conscience and encouraging him to visit Bob, luring Bart into Bob's clutches once again. The Simpsons race to the funeral home and just barely manage to save Bart in time as the police then arrive and arrest Bob and his family. Defeated but curious, Bob questions Lisa on how she was able to figure out his plot \u2013 Lisa admits that she actually started getting suspicious when she noticed that Bob's coffin had been custom-made to fit his feet and points out that his family likely would not have bothered paying for something like that if he was actually dead. Bob and his family are then incarcerated with the former's cellmate, Snake Jailbird, who constantly torments them while Bob goes insane over fantasizing about exacting his revenge one day."

The joke was written for The Simpsons Movie, in a scene that was cut from the final release of the movie, and reused here.John Mahoney is the third Frasier cast member to play a member of the Terwilliger family, after Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce, his on-screen sons in both shows.\nThe song Krusty sings at Bob's \"funeral\" is a take-off on \"Candle in the Wind\" by Elton John.

Instead of keeping the familiar dynamics these actors had shared before (a tactic that worked extremely well in Cecil's first appearance), the series took a different route, making Mahoney's father character just as uppity and snobbish as his animated sons.

Plus, it also brought a bit of continuity into the show, something that comes and goes on the program.\"Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, praising the appearance of Pierce and Mahoney as Cecil and Dr. Terwilliger post-Fraiser, but criticized the TiVo storyline at the beginning, and wondered \"if Lisa's recap of Sideshow Bob's plot was meant to be an homage to \"Black Widower,\" when Bart recapped Bob's plan to kill Selma.

The King's Speech led the nominations with twelve, followed by True Grit with ten.The winners were announced during the awards ceremony on February 27, 2011. Toy Story 3 became the third animated film to be nominated for Best Picture. True Grit was the second film after 2002's Gangs of New York to lose all ten of its nominations. By virtue of his nomination for Best Actor in 127 Hours, host James Franco became the first person since Paul Hogan, who was a co-host and a Best Original Screenplay nominee during the 59th ceremony in 1987, to host the ceremony while receiving a nomination in the same year. He was also the first acting nominee since Michael Caine at the 45th ceremony in 1973 to achieve this distinction. With Christian Bale and Melissa Leo's respective wins in the Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress categories, The Fighter became the first film since 1986's Hannah and Her Sisters to win both supporting acting categories."

        "content": "In June 2010, the AMPAS hired Oscar-winning producer Bruce Cohen and veteran television producer Don Mischer to oversee production of the telecast. \"I'm absolutely ecstatic that Bruce and Don have accepted my invitation to produce and direct the 83rd Academy Awards telecast,\" remarked Academy president Tom Sherak. \"Their work in producing the Academy's inaugural Governors Awards was exceptional and I am confident they will bring their creative vision and extraordinary talent to produce/direct a most memorable Oscar show.\" Although the prior ceremony hosted by Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin had the highest ratings in five years, their combined age was 116 years and the producers wanted to focus on a younger demographic. The unofficial first choice was Justin Timberlake but he declined, feeling it was at least a year too early for him.Opting for younger faces for the ceremony, Cohen and Mischer hired actor James Franco and actress Anne Hathaway as co-hosts of the 2011 ceremony. \"James Franco and Anne Hathaway personify the next generation of Hollywood icons \u2014 fresh, exciting and multi-talented. We hope to create an Oscar broadcast that will both showcase their incredible talents and entertain the world on February 27,\" said Cohen and Mischer regarding their selections to host the gala. \"We are completely thrilled that James and Anne will be joining forces with our brilliant creative team to do just that.\" Franco and Hathaway became the first male-female duo to co-host the awards show since comedian Jerry Lewis and actress Celeste Holm presided over the 29th ceremony in 1957. At age 28, Hathaway was also the youngest person to host an Oscar ceremony.Furthermore, AMPAS announced that this year's ceremony was \"the most interactive awards show in history\". The Academy revamped their official website oscar.com to include lists of all the nominees and winners, as well as film trailers and exclusive video content produced by both AMPAS and Oscar telecaster ABC. Also, via the Academy's Twitter and Facebook pages, people could post questions for any actor or celebrity attending the festivities to answer. One of the four Oscar pre-show co-hosts would then pose selected questions to both nominees and attendees alike. For a fee of US$4.99, users had online access to two dozen video streams that would take them from the red carpet, through the ceremony and on to the post-telecast Governors Ball. Several of the cameras utilized 360-degree views that viewers could direct.Several other people participated in the production of the ceremony. For a younger writer, France consulted Judd Apatow, who suggested Jordan Rubin who brought in Megan Amram. William Ross served as musical director and conductor for the ceremony. Production designer Steve Bass built a new stage design for the ceremony. Entertainment Weekly columnist and TV personality Dave Karger greeted guests entering the red carpet. Designer Marc Friedland designed a new envelope heralding the winner of each category made from a high-gloss iridescent metallic gold paper stock, with red-lacquered lining that featured the Oscar statuette stamped in satin gold leaf. During the run-up to the ceremony, television personality Chris Harrison hosted \"Road to the Oscars\", a weekly behind-the-scenes video blog. Ben Mankiewicz hosted the official ABC pre-show, giving professional betting odds for the winners. PS22 Chorus children's choir performed \"Over the Rainbow\" from The Wizard of Oz at the end of the ceremony.According to Rubin, Hathaway was heavily involved during the month of preparation. Franco on the other hand was busy shooting movies, while teaching a class and getting both his masters and his PhD. When filming started, Hathaway was focused and determined while Franco was more laid back, causing friction. In the closing weeks, Franco went back to Apatow who hired four additional writers; in response, Hathaway brought in Liz Feldman. This resulted last-minute scrambling. According to Amram, \"[a] lot of stuff that made it into the show was written a few days beforehand.\" Franco immediately left after the show ended, catching a flight to make a morning seminar on medieval manuscripts at Yale."

ABC televised the ceremony in the United States. Comedian and late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel hosted the Primetime Emmys for the first time. Kimmel and Kerry Washington announced the nominations on July 19, 2012. Nick Offerman was originally scheduled to co-announce the nominations, but had to cancel due to travel delays. The Creative Arts Emmy Awards ceremony was held on September 15 and was televised on September 22, 2012 on ReelzChannel.The award for Outstanding Drama Series went to Showtime crime drama Homeland, the first for that network, and which broke Mad Men's four-year hold on the award; while the Outstanding Comedy Series award went for the third year in a row to ABC's Modern Family. This was the first ceremony that none of the four major American broadcasting TV networks were nominated in the categories of Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, and Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. For Britain, the ceremony was noted for the successes of actors Damian Lewis of Homeland and Maggie Smith of Downton Abbey.Of the latter, Dame Maggie not only was PBS' first win in her category, she had won the previous year, for the same role in another category. Hers was also the first win in a major acting category for a Drama Series for PBS since 1975.\nMad Men set a new record for the largest \"shutout\" in Emmy history, receiving nominations for 17 awards and winning none. This broke the previous record of 16 nominations without a win, set by Northern Exposure in 1993 and The Larry Sanders Show in 1997. This record was broken by The Handmaid's Tale in 2021, which did not win any of its 21 nominations that year."

In addition, problems arose regarding staging the Oscars at the Shrine Auditorium because there was difficulty of directing guests from the auditorium where the main event took place to the adjacent Exhibition Hall for the Governor's Ball. In August 1997, AMPAS and Canadian development firm TrizecHahn went into negotiations over the development of an entertainment complex located on the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue adjacent to the Mann's Chinese Theatre. Seven months later, both the academy and TrizecHahn agreed on a twenty-year lease that allowed for the ceremony to be staged at a new venue, which would later be called the Kodak Theatre, located within the property which was also situated near the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel site of the inaugural awards ceremony in 1929. This was the first time the ceremony was held in Hollywood since the 32nd ceremony took place at the Pantages Theatre in 1960.In view of the return of the Oscars to Hollywood, the academy hired film producer and Sony Pictures Entertainment chairman Laura Ziskin in September 2001 to oversee production of the telecast. Pierson explained the decision to hire Ziskin saying, \"This show is one of the most difficult\u2014if not the most difficult\u2014producing jobs in show business. Laura Ziskin brings intelligence, experience and wit expressed in everything she has done.\" This marked the first occurrence that a woman produced the Oscars solo. Four months later, Whoopi Goldberg was selected as host of the 2002 ceremony. In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Ziskin justified her choice of Goldberg commenting that she has \"great warmth, with humor, humanity and social conscience, all qualities that I feel are essential for this year's show. I look forward to collaborating with Whoopi to put on a meaningful and entertaining evening.\"Furthermore, the September 11 attacks affected the telecast and its surrounding events. Despite speculation and suggestions that the festivities be postponed or canceled, AMPAS President Pierson wrote in a Variety column refusing to take such action stating that it would send the message that \"the terrorists have won\". However, due to security concerns the academy announced that red carpet bleacher seats would now be limited on a reservation basis based on a random selection and a background check.On Oscar night, Tom Cruise opened the show and stated that it was the job of filmmakers to make films during troubling times. In addition, later in the evening Goldberg introduced a \"New York icon\" to the stage and filmmaker and director Woody Allen, who had previously refused to attend a ceremony, made a surprise appearance. He was greeted with a hearty standing ovation from audience members including Baz Luhrmann, Ron Howard, Jennifer Connelly, Washington, and Ethan Hawke. He explained after the events that happened that September he was there to represent the city he so loved and to plead filmmakers to continue to film in New York City. Woody then presented a film montage created by fellow New Yorker and screenwriter Nora Ephron saluting New York City in film.Several other people participated in the production of the ceremony. Actors Glenn Close and Donald Sutherland served as announcers during the show. The orchestra led by film composer and telecast musical supervisor John Williams, performed selections of film scores during a montage saluting film composers produced by Kyle Cooper. Filmmaker Errol Morris filmed a vignette featuring several famous people discuss movie memories. Director Penelope Spheeris produced a montage saluting 60 years of Oscar-winning documentary feature films. Cirque du Soleil performed a dance number inspired by movies and visual effects."

The ceremony was hosted by Russell Brand.\nBeyonc\u00e9, Green Day, and Lady Gaga were tied for the most-awarded acts of the night, winning three awards each. Beyonc\u00e9's \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" won the award for Video of the Year, while Beyonc\u00e9 and Lady Gaga were both tied for the largest number of nominations with nine, followed by Britney Spears with seven. In the aftermath of his June 2009 death, the show featured various tributes to Michael Jackson, including an opening act featuring a medley of Jackson's biggest hits and a special appearance by Janet Jackson to perform her duet \"Scream\", and the premiere of a trailer for the posthumous documentary film Michael Jackson's This Is It.\nThe ceremony was marred by an incident in which Kanye West interrupted Taylor Swift's acceptance of the award for Best Female Video, in order to proclaim that despite her victory, Beyonc\u00e9 still had \"one of the best videos of all time\", referring to the aforementioned \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\". When Beyonc\u00e9 was eventually awarded Video of the Year, she acknowledged the moment when she had won her first VMA as part of Destiny's Child, and invited Swift back onstage to finish her acceptance speech. The incident was highly publicized, with Rolling Stone naming it the \"wildest\" moment in the history of the VMAs in 2013.\nThe broadcast was seen by a total of 9 million viewers, a 17% increase over 2008, making it the most-watched VMAs since 2004."

        "content": "As Taylor Swift was giving her Best Female Video acceptance speech for \"You Belong with Me\", Kanye West went on stage, took the microphone from her, and said: \"Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, I'mma let you finish, but Beyonc\u00e9 had one of the best videos of all time! One of the best videos of all time!\", referring to the music video for \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\". As the live audience booed, West handed the microphone back to Swift, shrugged his shoulders, and walked off stage.West was subsequently removed from the show. Later in the show, Beyonc\u00e9 won Video of the Year for \"Single Ladies\" and called Swift back onstage to let her finish her speech.Various celebrities and industry figures, as well as prominent political figures including then United States President Barack Obama and former President Jimmy Carter, condemned West for his verbal outburst at Taylor Swift. West apologized on his blog and during an appearance on The Jay Leno Show.Emil Wilbekin, managing editor of Essence magazine, argued that West may have gone too far with his actions, compared to the past: \"I think that it was not Kanye's place to speak for Beyonc\u00e9 or to ruin Taylor Swift's moment...  It's OK for Kanye to rattle off about himself, but I think he crossed the line when he decided to speak for other people.\" Los Angeles Times contributor Ann Powers opined that \"from one vantage point, it was a case of chivalry gone horribly wrong\" as West meant to \"stand up for\" Beyonc\u00e9. Powers was cynical about the onstage embrace Beyonc\u00e9 and Swift shared, calling it \"staged\" and stating that it added \"another layer of meaning to an already complicated moment. Now this controversy was about women sticking up for each other, too.\"In 2013, Rolling Stone named the incident the wildest moment in VMA history. The outburst resulted in a meme consisting of images of West being superimposed onto other images with text in the style of his interruption (\"X is one of the greatest Y of all time\", or variants thereon, in some cases preceded by \"I'm really happy for you\" and/or \"I'mma let you finish\").\" West later referenced the incident in his 2016 single \"Famous,\" controversially claiming that he made Swift famous through it."

The format has been exported to 60 other countries under the title Dancing with the Stars, licensed by BBC Worldwide, and led to a modern dance-themed spin-off Strictly Dance Fever. The Guinness World Records named Strictly as the world's most successful reality television format in 2010. The series is currently presented by Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman. Bruce Forsyth co-presented the series with Daly until 2014.\nThe series has been broadcast on BBC One since 15 May 2004, typically on Saturday evenings with a following Sunday night results show. From series 2 onwards, the show has been broadcast in the run up to Christmas.  With its high viewing figures, Strictly Come Dancing has become a significant programme on British television.

Later, entertainment executive Fenia Vardanis also suggested reviving Come Dancing, so Jane Lush, the then head of BBC Entertainment, put Hopkins and Vardanis together to develop the show.Hopkins then called in Karen Smith, who had just produced Comic Relief Does Fame Academy for BBC One and The Games for Channel 4, to help lead the development of the show and launch the series. Smith was the show-running Executive Producer of the first three series, and of sister show It Takes Two. She then took the role of Creative Director of BBC Entertainment whilst still overseeing series 4 and 5.Hopkins later took the format to America himself when the BBC dismissed the idea of selling it abroad, as they felt it was too British.The title is an amalgamation of the titles of the 1992 Australian film Strictly Ballroom and Come Dancing."

From series 8 to 11, Forsyth only presented the main show and was replaced for the results show by Claudia Winkleman, at which point Daly assumed Forsyth's role as main presenter and Winkleman assumed Daly's role as co-presenter. Winkleman joined Daly as full-time co-presenter for series 12 following Forsyth's departure after the 2013 series. Through telephone voting, viewers vote for who they would like to be in the next round, the results of the poll being combined with the ranking of the judges. For example, with ten contestants left, the judges' favourite would receive ten points, second favourite nine points, and so on, and similarly with the viewers' rankings. The bottom ranked couple gets one point. The profits from the telephone lines were donated to Sport Relief in series 1, to Children in Need from series 2, until series 8 when donations to charity stopped.\nThe show is broadcast live on BBC One on Saturday evenings, and is currently presented by Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman (with Zoe Ball covering for Winkleman for a number of weeks in 2014). Sir Bruce Forsyth presented the live shows alongside Daly from 2004 to 2013, announcing his departure in 2014. He was to continue to present special editions of the show. For most of the second series, Natasha Kaplinsky stood in temporarily for Daly while she took maternity leave; Claudia Winkleman hosted the results show and editions that Forsyth had missed between 2010 and 2013. The judging panel initially consisted of Bruno Tonioli, Arlene Phillips, Len Goodman and Craig Revel Horwood. Alesha Dixon took Phillips' place from series 7 to 9, after which she left the programme to judge Britain's Got Talent which led retired ballerina Dame Darcey Bussell to replace her. Goodman left the show after the 2016 series and was replaced by Shirley Ballas. Bussell remained as judge until 2018, and was replaced by Motsi Mabuse in 2019. Up until 2020, Tonioli commuted weekly between Hollywood and London to judge both the American and British versions of the show simultaneously- however, due the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, he could no longer juggle both the UK and US shows- he was not replaced for the 2020 series; but pro dancer Anton Du Beke took his place from the 2021 series, and has now replaced Tonioli full-time on the panel. The current judging panel consists of Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, Shirley Ballas and Anton Du Beke, making Horwood the only judge to remain with the programme since its inception. Each judge gives the performance a mark out of ten, giving an overall total out of forty. The voice-over announcer is Alan Dedicoat. During series four, an hour-long highlights show was shown on Sundays at 19:00 on BBC Two, and during series five and six, the results show moved to Sunday evenings, although it was filmed on Saturday and then broadcast \"as live\" on the Sunday.\nThe singers on the show are Tommy Blaize, Hayley Sanderson, Lance Ellington, Andrea Grant and, formerly, the well-known British dance music vocalist Tara McDonald. The music director is David Arch. Tommy Blaize has been part of Strictly since its beginning. David Arch joined in the fourth series and Hayley Sanderson in the fifth. The original musical director from series 1 to 3 was Laurie Holloway. In the seventeenth series, the singers were joined by Mitchell.The show was broadcast from a specially constructed set at BBC Television Centre (primarily in the largest studio, TC1) until its closure in 2013, with the show moving to Elstree Studios' George Lucas Stage 2 from 2013 onwards. However, in the first two series, shows were also filmed at the Tower Ballroom in Blackpool, where the original Come Dancing series was filmed in the 1970s.In the second series, two shows were filmed at the Tower Ballroom \u2014 show five and the Grand Final, which was broadcast live on 11 December 2004. In 2005 though the BBC announced that they would not be returning to the venue for the third series due to \"logistical problems\". In October 2008, Craig Revel Horwood called for the series to return to the Tower Ballroom, saying, \"The atmosphere was electric. It's huge and has so much history. The Tower Ballroom puts a lot of pressure on the professionals and the celebrities to perform to the best of their potential. What a wonderful place to go live to 12 million people. We have got to get the BBC to bring Strictly Come Dancing back to Blackpool.\" Eventually, for series 7, the show did return to the Tower Ballroom, where Blackpool-born Craig Kelly was eliminated. The episode was aired live on 7 November 2009. Strictly Come Dancing returned to Blackpool for the 2010 and 2011 series. After series 10, when Strictly Come Dancing did not go to Blackpool, they announced that they would return for series 11."

The ceremonies were presided over by Walter Matthau, Robert Shaw, George Segal, Goldie Hawn, and Gene Kelly. This year, ABC took over broadcast rights from NBC and has maintained the rights to this day. \nMilo\u0161 Forman's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest made a \"clean sweep\" of the five major categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Screenplay (Adapted). It was the second of three films to date to do so, following It Happened One Night in 1934 and preceding The Silence of the Lambs in 1991.\n20-year-old French actress Isabelle Adjani received her first nomination for Best Actress this year, becoming the youngest nominee that category, breaking the record set by 22-year-old Elizabeth Hartman in 1965. Her record would be surpassed by 13-year-old Keisha Castle-Hughes in 2004, and again in 2013 by nine-year old Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis, the current record. Adjani also co-presented the award for Best Film Editing.\nAt 80, George Burns became the oldest acting winner, as well as the last person born in the nineteenth century to receive an acting award. His record stood until Jessica Tandy won Best Actress in 1989; Burns was later succeeded as the oldest Best Supporting Actor winner by Christopher Plummer, who won in 2012 for Beginners at the age of 82.\nJaws won all its nominations except Best Picture, the last film to do so until Traffic. As of the 94th Academy Awards, Amarcord, nominated for Best Director, is the last film to be nominated for Academy Awards in separate years (having won the award for Best Foreign Language Film the year before).\nNBC's coverage of the NCAA championship basketball game aired opposite the ceremony; during the presentation of the Best Film Editing award, the winner was jokingly announced by presenter Elliott Gould as \"Indiana, 86\u201368\", after the undefeated Indiana Hoosiers had won the NCAA title that night in Philadelphia."

        "content": "Educational programming began to be broadcast by Rede Globo on 16 January 1978 when the secondary-school oriented Telecurso 2o Grau started broadcasting; it was initially created by Rede Globo in conjunction with the Padre Anchieta Foundation (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Padre Anchieta) and the Roberto Marinho Foundation. Unlike almost all other programs shown by Rede Globo, the program was presented commercial-free for its entire run due to its educational nature, although promos for the network's shows and public service announcements were still shown in between segments of the program. In 1981, Telecurso was expanded from 15 to 30 minutes with the launch of Telecurso 1o Grau, which concentrated on educational lessons for elementary school children.\nIn 1986, the Roberto Marinho Foundation retitled the original program as Novo Telecurso 2o Grau and a new partnership was obtained with Bradesco; the courses featured were authorized to become a valid form of educative material in schools around Brazil, as well as in certain companies. On 2 January 1995, the entire educational programming block was rebranded as Telecurso 2000 and expanded to 45 minutes with the launch of Telecurso 2000 Profissionalizante (which focused on vocational subjects).\nOn 31 March 2008, the program was reformatted as Novo Telecurso, which removed outdated segments of geography and history that were no longer being used and replaced them with philosophy, visual arts, music, theatre, sociology, and Spanish language topics that were aimed at secondary students who have not completed their education. In 2009, a new partnership was attained with SENAI-SP for the vocational segments of the program.On 28 November 2014, Telecurso aired for the last time on Rede Globo. It was replaced by Hora Um, an early-morning news program that premiered on 1 December 2014. The daily edition of Globo Rural aired the last time on the same day; the weekly edition currently airs on Sundays at 8:00 am."

However, actor Seth MacFarlane announced that he would not host the Oscars for a second time. In a statement released through Twitter, he wrote \"Traumatized critics exhale: I'm unable to do the Oscars again. Tried to make it work schedule-wise, but I need sleep.\" Furthermore, actress and comedian Tina Fey, who co-hosted the 70th Golden Globe Awards more than a month earlier with fellow Saturday Night Live alumnus Amy Poehler, told Huffington Post columnist Mike Ryan that she would reject any offer to host an Oscar telecast commenting, \"I just feel like that gig is so hard. Especially for, like, a woman \u2013 the amount of months that would be spent trying on dresses alone \u2013 no way.\"Shortly after the election of AMPAS president Cheryl Boone Isaacs in August 2013, Meron and Zadan announced that comedian and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres would host the 2014 ceremony. They explained their decision to bring back DeGeneres as host saying, \"As a longtime friend, we had always hoped to find a project for us to do together and nothing could be more exciting than teaming up to do the Oscars. There are few stars today who have Ellen's gift for comedy, with her great warmth and humanity. She is beloved everywhere and we expect that the audience at the Dolby Theatre and in homes around the globe will be as excited by this news as we are.\" DeGeneres expressed that she was thrilled to be selected to emcee the gala again, commenting, \"I am so excited to be hosting the Oscars for the second time. You know what they say \u2013 the third time's the charm.\"As with last year's theme of music and the movies, Meron and Zadan centered the show around a theme. This year, they christened the show with a theme of saluting movie heroes commenting, \"By celebrating the gamut of heroes who have enriched our movie-going experience, we hope to create an evening of fun and joy. And that includes the filmmakers and actors who take risks and stimulate us with provocative subjects and daring characters. They are all heroes in the cinematic landscape.\" To coincide with the theme, AMPAS presented an exhibition in the lobby of its Beverly Hills headquarters titled \"The Oscars Celebrate Movie Heroes\". The exhibit featured posters, photographs, and artifacts from 70 different films featuring literary, comic book, and real life heroes. Furthermore, actor Andrew Garfield, who portrayed the titular character in The Amazing Spider-Man, was scheduled to appear onstage with five-year-old cancer survivor Miles Scott with Garfield christening Scott as an \"official superhero\". The segment was scrapped, however, due to time constraints.Several other people were involved with the telecast and its promotion. Tony Award-winning art director Derek McLane designed a new set and stage design for the show. Filmmaker Paul Feig produced and directed a one-minute trailer promoting the event featuring DeGeneres and 250 dancers dancing and lip-synching to the song \"The Walker\" by rock band Fitz and the Tantrums. During the ceremony, actor Channing Tatum introduced a group called \"Team Oscar\". The team consisted of six young film students from colleges across the country selected by AMPAS whose role was to deliver Oscar statuettes to the presenters during the gala. Television personality and former Miss USA titleholder Rachel Smith hosted \"Inside the Oscars\", a behind-the-scenes video blog on the Oscar ceremony website."

With the event now \"host-less\", Anthony Anderson rushed on stage in a skit where he insisted that \"We're going to go without a host tonight!\" and pushed the first presenter Bryan Cranston to the stage to welcome the audience and introduce a montage of video clips. The ceremony continued in such fashion with only Lennon and montages and clips filling the time between presenters.Several winners made notable \"statement speeches\" while accepting their awards. After winning the award for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series for The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Alex Borstein said:\nMy grandmother was in line to be shot into a pit... she turned to a guard and she said \"What happens if I step out of line?\" and he said \"I don't have the heart to shoot you but somebody will\". And she stepped out of line, and for that I am here and for that my children are here, so step out of line ladies, step out of line.\nThe winner for outstanding supporting actress in a limited series or movie, Patricia Arquette (The Act), in her acceptance speech said \"I'm grateful at 50 to be getting the best parts of my life\" and paid tribute to her sister, Alexis Arquette, who had died in 2016. Michelle Williams, after winning the award for outstanding lead actress in a limited series or movie for Fosse/Verdon, made references to the gender and racial wage gaps in the film industry, as well as the Time's Up movement:\nThe next time a woman, and especially a woman of color\u2014because she stands to make 52 cents on the dollar compared to her white, male counterpart\u2014tells you what she needs to do her job, listen to her, believe her, because one day she might stand in front of you and say thank you for allowing her to succeed because of her workplace environment and not in spite of it.\nIn the In Memoriam presentation, a photograph of conductor Leonard Slatkin, who is alive and working in Ireland, was mistakenly used and captioned as Andr\u00e9 Previn, who died in February 2019."

However, Crystal declined the offer citing his commitment to his one-man comedy show 700 Sundays.In January 2006, Cates announced that actor, comedian, and talk show host Jon Stewart, who had previously hosted two consecutive Grammy Awards ceremonies in 2001 and 2002, was chosen as host of the 2006 telecast.

Jon is the epitome of a perfect host \u2014 smart, engaging, irreverent and funny.\" In a statement, Stewart expressed that he was honored to be selected to emcee the program, jokingly adding, \"Although, as an avid watcher of the Oscars, I can't help but be a little disappointed with the choice. It appears to be another sad attempt to smoke out Billy Crystal.\"Several other people and companies participated in the production of the ceremony. Bill Conti served as musical supervisor for the telecast. Media firm The Ant Farm produced a thirty-second trailer promoting the broadcast featuring clips highlighting past Oscar winners to the tune of the song \"Our Lives\" by The Calling. Previous Oscar hosts such as Whoopi Goldberg and Steve Martin, and actors Mel Gibson, George Clooney, Halle Berry appeared in an opening comedic sketch. Actor Tom Hanks participated in a pre-taped comedic sketch lampooning Oscar speeches. Stephen Colbert (host of The Colbert Report, the sister program of Stewart's The Daily Show) narrated two different mock attack ads lampooning both the intense campaigning and lobbying during Oscar season put forth by film studios and political advertising during elections. Violinist Itzhak Perlman performed excerpts from the five nominees for Best Original Score."

        "content": "As part of a rotating deal among the \"Big Four\" networks signed in 2018, ABC held the rights to broadcast the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards. On January 8, 2020, during the Television Critics Association's annual winter tour, ABC announced that the ceremony would be broadcast on September 20 from the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, while the Creative Arts ceremonies would be held on September 12 and 13. However, the COVID-19 pandemic led to significant changes. The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, also known as the Television Academy, announced on June 15 that the Creative Arts ceremonies would be presented virtually due to the pandemic. Additionally, the annual Governors Ball was cancelled for the first time in its history, with the Television Academy making a $1 million donation to the Actors Fund's COVID-19 efforts in its place. The new Creative Arts dates were announced in August, with the ceremonies to be aired across five nights between September 14 and 19. On July 29, the main ceremony was moved to a remote format as well.Jimmy Kimmel was announced as the ceremony's host on June 16. This year marked his third time as host, following 2012 and 2016. Kimmel also served as an executive producer for the event. In July, Guy Carrington, Reginald Hudlin, David Jammy, and Ian Stewart were added as executive producers, with Done and Dusted producing the ceremony. Hamish Hamilton served as director for the event.While Kimmel presented the ceremony from the Staples Center, no in-person festivities (such as a red carpet or audience) at the venue took place. Celebrity guests still made on-stage appearances, including Jennifer Aniston and Anthony Anderson. The broadcast used live feeds from each nominee, with television series being represented by one of their producers. A notable exception was Schitt's Creek, whose cast and crew appeared together from a viewing party in Toronto. To maintain a high-quality presentation, the use of video-conferencing was avoided, with producers sending \"professional\" cameras to each nominee's location, as well as an operator, if they so chose. Hudlin stated that they wanted to maintain a live broadcast, while Stewart argued that \"we're not trying to make the Zoomies, we're trying to make the Emmys\". Staples Center was chosen as the venue to ensure that appropriate social distancing could be practiced among crew members, and because it could support the infrastructure needed for the large number of remote feeds that would be used (estimated to be around 140).A number of comedy gags acknowledged the pandemic and the format of the ceremony. Kimmel's opening monologue featured a laugh track and footage of audience reactions from past Emmy ceremonies. After using a clip that depicted Kimmel himself as an audience member, he revealed the empty arena, and seats with cardboard cut-outs of nominees (except for the real Jason Bateman, whom Kimmel told could stay if he promised to laugh at his jokes; Bateman left). Kimmel was also seen disinfecting the envelope for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series with Lysol spray; after Aniston commented that it was \"a little extreme\", Kimmel proceeded to throw it in a trash can and set it on fire instead. Some awards were delivered to winners via presenters in themed Hazmat suits designed to look like formalwear."

        "content": "Today was launched on the BBC Home Service on 28 October 1957 as a programme of \"topical talks\" to give listeners an alternative to listening to light music. The programme's founders were Isa Benzie and Janet Quigley. Benzie gave the programme its name and served as its first de facto editor. It was initially broadcast as two 20-minute editions slotted in around the existing news bulletins and religious and musical items. It became part of the BBC's Current Affairs department in 1963, and started to become more news-orientated. The two editions also became longer, and by the end of the 1960s it had become a single programme two hours in length that enveloped the news bulletins and the religious talk that had become Thought for the Day in 1970. In May 1977, Radio 4 controller Ian McIntyre cut it to two 25-minute parts, filling the gap with Up to the Hour. The new format was unpopular with BBC staff, including Peter Donaldson who on at least one occasion openly ridiculed the programme on air. It also provoked comments in the diary columns of the daily newspapers. From July 1978, Today returned to its previous length and Up to the Hour was dropped.Jack de Manio became its principal presenter in 1958. He was held in affection by listeners, but became notorious for on-air gaffes (announcing a documentary on Nigeria titled The Land of Niger as The Land of Nigger, and referring to Yoko Ono as \"Yoko Hama, or whatever her name is\", for instance). In 1970 the programme format was changed so that there were two presenters each day. De Manio left in 1971, and in the late 1970s the team of John Timpson and Brian Redhead became established. Timpson had been critical of the content, style and professionalism of Today; describing it once as \"not so much a programme, more a way of telling the time\" and being filled with \"eccentric octogenarians, prize pumpkins, and folk who ate lightbulbs and spiders\".In the late 1970s and early 1980s, under editors Ken Goudie and Julian Holland, Today made moves to broaden its appeal away from broadcasting a lot of national politics with London-centric bias. Presentation was split for a time between London, usually by John Timpson, and from Manchester, usually by Brian Redhead. The objective was to make it more of a balanced, national programme. The on-air humour of the two presenters and the split of locations made the programme very popular and influential. Brian Redhead was quoted, \"If you want to drop a word in the ear of the nation, then this is the programme in which to do it.\" This pairing lasted until Timpson's retirement in 1986. Other presenters during this period included Libby Purves in the late 1970s. John Humphrys and Sue MacGregor joined the rotating list of presenters in 1986. Peter Hobday, who had first broadcast on the programme in the 1950s, was a regular presenter from the early 1980s and a favourite with listeners because of his relaxed, urbane style.\nBy this time the programme was benefiting from publicity gained after it became known that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was a regular listener. Ministers thus became keen to go on the programme, but the tough, confrontational interviewing they encountered led to accusations that the BBC was biased. Criticism was particularly directed against Redhead, who was often seen as being on the left. Chancellor Nigel Lawson accused him, during a live interview in 1988, of having been a Labour voter all his life. The style of the male interviewers was analysed and contrasted with the approach of MacGregor, who was alleged to be giving subjects an easier time. The \"Big 8:10\" interview that follows the 8 am news had become an important institution of British politics, a position it retains.After Brian Redhead died in January 1994, James Naughtie became a member of the team. Peter Hobday presented the programme regularly until 1996; Sarah Montague replaced MacGregor in 2002. Carolyn Quinn was a regular presenter until 2008 as was Edward Stourton until 2009. Other more occasional presenters include the BBC's Stephen Sackur and Tim Franks. Evan Davis and Justin Webb were the newest regular presenters to join the roster until Mishal Husain in 2013. Husain became the second regular female presenter when James Naughtie began to cover the Scottish Independence referendum as a Good Morning Scotland presenter for two days a week, and across the BBC's output. Naughtie returned to Today before the 2015 general election.On 7 July 2015, the BBC announced that James Naughtie was to leave the programme, to become a Special Correspondent for BBC Radio 4. Two days later, Nick Robinson was announced as Naughtie's replacement. In April 2018, Martha Kearney joined the team in a straight swap with Sarah Montague, who left to take over Kearney's old role as lead presenter of The World at One.On 19 September 2019, John Humphrys hosted his last edition of Today, after 32 years on the show. His last major guests were former Prime Ministers David Cameron and Tony Blair, as well as drag personality Dame Edna Everage."

If Parliament is in session the previous day there will be a summary at about 06:50 (Yesterday in Parliament) presented by two from Robert Orchard, David Wilby, Rachel Hooper and Susan Hulme.Journalist and historian Peter Hennessy has made an assertion in one of his books that a test that the commander of a British nuclear-missile submarine must use to determine whether the UK has been the target of a nuclear attack (in which case he has sealed orders which may authorise him to fire his nuclear missiles in retaliation), is to listen for the presence of Today on Radio 4's frequencies. If a certain number of days (said to be three) pass without the programme being broadcast, that is to be taken as evidence that the orders must be executed. The true conditions are of course secret, and Hennessy has never revealed his sources for this story, leading Paul Donovan, author of a book about Today, to express some scepticism about it. However, the longwave signal of Radio 4 is capable of penetrating to surface depths where submarines can rise, although it does not have the range required to be heard at this depth far from the UK's coastal waters."

However, on 16 November 2006 the programme changed its board policy so that only the producers of Today could start a thread, but all contributors could still join in with them. This action appeared to have been unpopular with past contributors and, it seems, many stopped dealing with Today in favour of other outlets. After the changes there were fewer contributions, but, on occasion, contributions made by the public were featured on-air in the Today programme. Message boards dedicated to the Today programme were discontinued around mid-2008 and listeners were invited to use the general BBC 'Have Your Say' board."

In the article, he wrote that catching \"a glimpse of the forces supporting the Countryside Alliance: the public schools that laid on coaches; the fusty, belch-filled dining rooms of the London clubs that opened their doors, for the first time, to the protesters; the Prince of Wales and, of course, Camilla ... and suddenly, rather gloriously, it might be that you remember [why you voted Labour] once again.\" He resigned from his post on Today.\nIn the summer of 2003, Today once again found itself at the centre of allegations of political bias, this time against a Labour government. The controversy arose after Today broadcast a report by its correspondent Andrew Gilligan. The report alleged that a dossier the British Government had produced to convince the British public of the need to invade Iraq had been \"sexed up\" (deliberately exaggerated), and that the government had known this prior to publishing it. In his live interview with presenter John Humphrys, just after 6.07 a.m., Gilligan asserted that the dossier and the Government \"probably knew\" that one of the main claims in the dossier \"was wrong\". Gilligan's anonymous source for the claim was Dr David Kelly, a key adviser on biological weapons who had worked in Iraq \u2013 though it was never established whether Dr Kelly had actually used the words Gilligan attributed to him. In the furore that followed Gilligan's report, Kelly's name became public and he was forced to appear before the Foreign Affairs Select Committee. Shortly afterward he was found dead following presumed suicide. In the ensuing public inquiry (the Hutton Inquiry), which reported in January 2004, the BBC was heavily criticised. This led to the resignation of the BBC's chairman, Gavyn Davies, the Director-General, Greg Dyke, and Andrew Gilligan.\nOn Friday 5 November 2010, the programme was not broadcast due to 48-hour strike action at the BBC. Transmission continued the next day, in spite of ongoing industrial action, as Evan Davis and Sarah Montague decided to break the strike."

        "content": "\"Radio 4 on the whole is good for using serious female presenters, but the Today programme lets it down badly\", commented former Today newsreader Alice Arnold early in 2013, pointing out that Sarah Montague was (then) the only female presenter among the regular presenters. During 2010, editor Ceri Thomas acknowledged that the gender balance was not ideal, but faced criticism for saying in an interview that the programme was not going to be the \"first place you'll see those changes because it's just too tough an environment for novices, frankly\". Radio 4 presenter Mariella Frostrup described the men involved in running the programme in an interview as \"a bunch of misogynists\", but later retracted this statement by saying she had been \"careless\" in her vocabulary.In 2011, Guardian journalist Kira Cochrane and colleagues researched the female\u2013male ratio in the British media for a month. Concerning Today they found 83.5% of the contributors were male and the remaining 16.5% female. The issue was thought important enough for culture minister Ed Vaizey to request a meeting with the BBC in January 2012, and for Director-General George Entwistle, at the start of his brief period in charge of the BBC, to advocate that the next new Today presenter should be female.An interview with David Cameron conducted by John Humphrys in 2006 received 200 complaints concerning Humphrys' aggressive approach and \"excessive\" interruptions. Ceri Thomas became the programme's editor shortly afterwards and was asked about this issue. \"I'm not going to rule out the confrontational interview as it is on occasion necessary... [A]ll the evidence we've got shows that the audience is overwhelmingly behind John Humphrys in general and support our right to do [this] kind of interviews.\"In a 2012 article decrying the BBC's attitude to science reporting, Guardian science columnist Martin Robbins wrote: \"The Today programme claims to be serious, but seems to work on the basis that the best way to enlighten viewers is to take two people and force them into a sort of intellectual-masturbation death match. Graham Linehan appeared on the show last year to discuss his adaptation of The Ladykillers and found himself ambushed by questions that weren't just hostile, but sometimes completely bizarre.\" Expert Women's Days, intended by the BBC as a training exercise intended in part to increase the number of female interviewees on Today, took place in several locations in 2013."

        "content": "What If...? is an American animated anthology television series created by A. C. Bradley for the streaming service Disney+ based on the Marvel Comics series of the same name. It is the fourth television series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) produced by Marvel Studios, and the studio's first animated series from Marvel Studios Animation. The series explores alternate timelines in the multiverse that show what would happen if major moments from the MCU films occurred differently. Bradley serves as head writer for the first two seasons, with Matthew Chauncey for the third, and Bryan Andrews as the lead director.\nJeffrey Wright stars as the Watcher, who narrates the series, alongside many MCU film actors reprising their roles. Marvel Studios was developing the series for Disney+ by the end of 2018, with Bradley and Andrews on board. It was officially announced in April 2019. Marvel Studios' head of visual development Ryan Meinerding helped define the series' cel-shaded animation style, which was designed to reflect the films and take inspiration from classic American illustrators. Animation for the series was provided by  Flying Bark Productions and Stellar Creative Lab, with Blue Spirit and Squeeze also providing animation in the first season and SDFX Studios also animating in the second season. Stephan Franck served as head of animation in the first season, as well as a director on the second season, with Scott Wright as head of animation in the second. Chauncey, who served as the series' story editor, replaced Bradley as head writer for the third season.\nThe first season of What If...? premiered on August 11, 2021, and ran for nine episodes until October 6, as part of Phase Four of the MCU. The second season premiered on December 22, 2023, as part of Phase Five, and released its nine episodes daily until December 30. The series has received generally positive reviews, with praise for the voice acting, animation, creative storylines, and scenarios, although the episodes' length and writing received some criticism. A third season and a spin-off series titled Marvel Zombies are in development."

        "content": "The series is narrated by Jeffrey Wright as the Watcher, a member of the alien Watcher race who observes the multiverse, in a similar role to Rod Serling's in The Twilight Zone. Head writer A. C. Bradley said the character is \"above everything else\" and compared him to a viewer of the \"pizza rat\" video, observing and not interfering as he has \"no interest in becoming friends with the rat, living amongst the rat, or doing rat things... That is the Watcher's relationship with humanity.\" Executive producer Brad Winderbaum felt Wright's performance inspired a sense of humanity while explaining the episodes, and Bradley explained that Wright was cast because his voice mixes power, charisma, and authority with a \"warm personality\". Wright approached the character like he would a live-action role, learning as much as he could about the Watcher so his voice could reflect the character's \"uniquely powerful, all-seeing, sagely presence\". Wright chose a contemporary American accent rather than having the character sound like \"some Oxford-educated, old, fusty guy in a tudor parlor somewhere\", and aside from researching the character's comic book appearances, took inspiration from the series's tone, visuals, and animation when developing the character's voice. For the second season, Wright was able to see how his performance played with animation for the first-season episodes, allowing him to make some adjustments to his performance such as adding \"a bit more mystery to the voice and a bit more distance\" to further the notion that the Watcher is \"not entirely present\". The comic book name \"Uatu\" is not used in the series because this would imply that there was more than one being watching the series' events when Bradley instead wanted to focus on the narrative of \"the Watcher\" observing the different characters and realities and how those affect him.:\u200a12:04\u201313:35\u200aMore than 50 actors reprise their MCU film roles in the first season,:\u200a2\u200a while over 30 reprise their roles in the second season."

It is an annual award ceremony held since 1944 to honor artists and professionals and their work. The ceremony is normally held every January, and has been a major part of the film industry's awards season, which culminates each year in the Academy Awards. The eligibility period for the Golden Globes corresponds to the calendar year (from January 1 through December 31).\nThe Golden Globes were founded by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), an organization representing international journalists who reported on the American entertainment industry. Revenue from the ceremony was used by the HFPA to fund entertainment-related charities and scholarships, such as the Young Artist Awards. \nThe HFPA had a history of criticism from the movie industry since the 1950s for the small size of its voting membership compared to the Academy Awards and other such accolades, the group's celebrity fawning, and their voting tactics. In 2021, these issues culminated with boycotts of the Golden Globes over the lack of racial diversity in its member body. These resulted in a series of reforms to the HFPA, intended to improve its accountability and widen its voting membership. In June 2022, the HFPA approved a reorganization of the Golden Globes into a for-profit venture owned by Eldridge Industries. This was finalized in June 2023, with the ceremony's assets being acquired by the Eldridge-owned Dick Clark Productions (which has produced the Golden Globes telecast since 1993), and the Golden Globe Foundation being established to continue the HFPA's philanthropic activities."

It is broadcast on the TF1 network, and was hosted by Jean-Pierre Foucault from 2000 until 2019, then by Camille Combal.\nFor more about the show and rules see Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?; the money tree differs in amounts, but the format is virtually identical. For several years a \"Switch the Question\" lifeline was available once a contestant answered the fifth question correctly. As of April 2009, the first three possible questions were taken out of the game, reducing the number of possible questions to 12, similar to the UK format in play from September 2007 to February 2014. For list of international variants of the show, see International versions of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?.\nThe show served as a plot device in the French film My Best Friend.\nIn December 2010, TF1 announced the end of the first daily multi-year run, due to a fall in viewing of that series as of June.A prime-time version with celebrities (for charity) was maintained between 2010 and final broadcast of that main series on January 1, 2016.\nIn December 2018 in a charity version, Jean-Pierre Foucault announced he would leave the show in favour of Camille Combal for a return to the air on TF1 in January 2019 \u2013 each figured respectively as a contestant on those shows also.In February 2019, TF1 announced the return of the daily version.

The contestant must provide the friends' names and phone numbers in advance. The contestant has thirty seconds to read the question and four choices to the friend, who must select an answer before the time runs out. Phone-a-friends often express their certainty as a percentage (I am 80% sure it's C).\nAsk the Audience (L'avis du public) (2000\u20132016, 2019): The contestant asks the studio audience which answer they believe is correct. Members of the studio audience indicate their choices using an audience response system. The results are immediately displayed on the contestant's and host's screens. This is a popular lifeline, known for its high accuracy.\nSwitch the Question (Le switch) (2006\u20132009): This was available after the contestant correctly answered the \u20ac1,500 question. Before choosing a final answer this lifeline entitled the contestant to switch the original question for another of the same value. Once used, return to the original question was forbidden, whose correct answer was revealed (for entirely academic purposes). Any lifelines used by the contestant attempting to answer the original question were not reinstated.\nAsk the Host (Le feeling de Camille) (2019\u2013): Used in the 20th anniversary of the British original, the French revival, and the Italian revival. When used by the contestant, the host uses their knowledge of a question's subject, gives their thoughts about the question, and tries to assist them with finding the correct answer out of the choices given. The lifeline features no time limit, and the host reassures all they have no connection to the outside world and receive the question and possible answers for it at the same time as the contestant, and thus have no knowledge of what the correct answer is.\nCall Home (L'appel \u00e0 la maison) (2020): This lifeline works exactly like the \"Phone-A-Friend\", except that instead of an acquaintance of the contestant's choice, an anonymous person who registered beforehand is randomly selected and called to try to help the contestant answer the question."
