        "content": "Personality is the characteristic sets of behaviors, cognitions, and emotional patterns that evolve from biological and environmental factors. While there is no generally agreed upon definition of personality, most theories focus on motivation and psychological interactions with the environment one is surrounded by. Trait-based personality theories, such as those defined by Raymond Cattell, define personality as traits that predict an individual's behavior. On the other hand, more behaviorally-based approaches define personality through learning and habits. Nevertheless, most theories view personality as relatively stable. The study of the psychology of personality, called personality psychology, attempts to explain the tendencies that underlie differences in behavior. Psychologists have taken many different approaches to the study of personality, including biological, cognitive, learning, and trait-based theories, as well as psychodynamic, and humanistic approaches.  The various approaches used to study personality today reflect the influence of the first theorists in the field, a group that includes Sigmund Freud, Alfred Adler, Gordon Allport, Hans Eysenck, Abraham Maslow, and Carl Rogers."

        "content": "Personality can be determined through a variety of tests. Due to the fact that personality is a complex idea, the dimensions of personality and scales of such tests vary and often are poorly defined. Two main tools to measure personality are objective tests and projective measures. Examples of such tests are the: Big Five Inventory (BFI), Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2), Rorschach Inkblot test, Neurotic Personality Questionnaire KON-2006, or Eysenck's Personality Questionnaire (EPQ-R). All of these tests are beneficial because they have both reliability and validity, two factors that make a test accurate. \"Each item should be influenced to a degree by the underlying trait construct, giving rise to a pattern of positive intercorrelations so long as all items are oriented (worded) in the same direction.\" A recent, but not well-known, measuring tool that psychologists use is the 16PF. It measures personality based on Cattell's 16-factor theory of personality. Psychologists also use it as a clinical measuring tool to diagnose psychiatric disorders and help with prognosis and therapy planning. Personality is frequently broken into factors or dimensions, statistically extracted from large questionnaires through Factor analysis. When brought back to two dimensions, often the dimensions of introvert-extrovert and neuroticism (emotionally unstable-stable) are used as first proposed by Eysenck in the 1960s."

        "content": "Many factor analyses found what is called the Big Five, which are openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (or emotional stability), known as \"OCEAN\".These components are generally stable over time, and about half of the variance appears to be attributable to a person's genetics rather than the effects of one's environment. Some research has investigated whether the relationship between happiness and extraversion saw in adults also can be seen in children. The implications of these findings can help identify children that are more likely to experience episodes of depression and develop types of treatment that such children are likely to respond to. In both children and adults, research shows that genetics, as opposed to environmental factors, exert a greater influence on happiness levels. Personality is not stable over the course of a lifetime, but it changes much more quickly during childhood, so personality constructs in children are referred to as temperament. Temperament is regarded as the precursor to personality. Another interesting finding has been the link found between acting extraverted and positive affect. Extraverted behaviors include acting talkative, assertive, adventurous, and outgoing. For the purposes of this study, positive affect is defined as experiences of happy and enjoyable emotions. This study investigated the effects of acting in a way that is counter to a person's dispositional nature. In other words, the study focused on the benefits and drawbacks of introverts (people who are shy, socially inhibited, and non-aggressive) acting extraverted, and of extraverts acting introverted. After acting extraverted, introverts' experience of positive affect increased whereas extraverts seemed to experience lower levels of positive affect and suffered from the phenomenon of ego depletion. Ego depletion, or cognitive fatigue, is the use of one's energy to overtly act in a way that is contrary to one's inner disposition. When people act in a contrary fashion, they divert most, if not all, (cognitive) energy toward regulating this foreign style of behavior and attitudes. Because all available energy is being used to maintain this contrary behavior, the result is an inability to use any energy to make important or difficult decisions, plan for the future, control or regulate emotions, or perform effectively on other cognitive tasks. One question that has been posed is why extroverts tend to be happier than introverts. The two types of explanations that attempt to account for this difference are instrumental theories and temperamental theories. The instrumental theory suggests that extraverts end up making choices that place them in more positive situations and they also react more strongly than introverts to positive situations. The temperamental theory suggests that extroverts have a disposition that generally leads them to experience a higher degree of positive affect. In their study of extraversion, Lucas and Baird found no statistically significant support for the instrumental theory but did, however, find that extraverts generally experience a higher level of positive affect. Research has been done to uncover some of the mediators that are responsible for the correlation between extraversion and happiness. Self-esteem and self-efficacy are two such mediators. Self-efficacy is one's belief about abilities to perform up to personal standards, the ability to produce desired results, and the feeling of having some ability to make important life decisions. Self-efficacy has been found to be related to the personality traits of extraversion and subjective well-being. Self-efficacy, however, only partially mediates the relationship between extraversion (and neuroticism) and subjective happiness. This implies that there are most likely other factors that mediate the relationship between subjective happiness and personality traits. Self-esteem maybe another similar factor. Individuals with a greater degree of confidence about themselves and their abilities seem to have both higher degrees of subjective well-being and higher levels of extraversion. Other research has examined the phenomenon of mood maintenance as another possible mediator. Mood maintenance is the ability to maintain one's average level of happiness in the face of an ambiguous situation \u2013 meaning a situation that has the potential to engender either positive or negative emotions in different individuals. It has been found to be a stronger force in extroverts. This means that the happiness levels of extraverted individuals are less susceptible to the influence of external events. This finding implies that extraverts' positive moods last longer than those of introverts."

        "content": "Modern conceptions of personality, such as the Temperament and Character Inventory have suggested four basic temperaments that are thought to reflect basic and automatic responses to danger and reward that rely on associative learning. The four temperaments, harm avoidance, reward dependence, novelty-seeking and persistence, are somewhat analogous to ancient conceptions of melancholic, sanguine, choleric, phlegmatic personality types, although the temperaments reflect dimensions rather than distance categories. The harm avoidance trait has been associated with increased reactivity in insular and amygdala salience networks, as well as reduced 5-HT2 receptor binding peripherally, and reduced GABA concentrations. Novelty seeking has been associated with reduced activity in insular salience networks increased striatal connectivity. Novelty seeking correlates with dopamine synthesis capacity in the striatum and reduced auto receptor availability in the midbrain. Reward dependence has been linked with the oxytocin system, with increased concentration of plasma oxytocin being observed, as well as increased volume in oxytocin-related regions of the hypothalamus. Persistence has been associated with increased striatal-mPFC connectivity, increased activation of ventral striatal-orbitofrontal-anterior cingulate circuits, as well as increased salivary amylase levels indicative of increased noradrenergic tone."

        "title": "Personality_Environmental influences",
        "content": "It has been shown that personality traits are more malleable by environmental influences than researchers originally believed. Personality differences predict the occurrence of life experiences. One study has shown how the home environment, specifically the types of parents a person has, can affect and shape their personality. Mary Ainsworth's Strange situation experiment showcased how babies reacted to having their mother leave them alone in a room with a stranger. The different styles of attachment, labeled by Ainsworth, were Secure, Ambivalent, avoidant, and disorganized. Children who were securely attached tend to be more trusting, sociable, and are confident in their day-to-day life. Children who were disorganized were reported to have higher levels of anxiety, anger, and risk-taking behavior. Judith Rich Harris's group socialization theory postulates that an individual's peer groups, rather than parental figures, are the primary influence of personality and behavior in adulthood. Intra- and intergroup processes, not dyadic relationships such as parent-child relationships, are responsible for the transmission of culture and for environmental modification of children's personality characteristics. Thus, this theory points at the peer group representing the environmental influence on a child's personality rather than the parental style or home environment. Tessuya Kawamoto's Personality Change from Life Experiences: Moderation Effect of Attachment Security talked about some significant laboratory tests. The study mainly focused on the effects of life experiences on change in personality and life experiences. The assessments suggested that \"the accumulation of small daily experiences may work for the personality development of university students and that environmental influences may vary by individual susceptibility to experiences, like attachment security\". Some studies suggest that a shared family environment between siblings has less influence on personality than individual experiences of each child. Identical twins have similar personalities largely because they share the same genetic makeup rather than their shared environment."

        "title": "Personality_Cross-cultural studies",
        "content": "There has been some recent debate over the subject of studying personality in a different culture. Some people think that personality comes entirely from culture and therefore there can be no meaningful study in cross-culture study. On the other hand, many believe that some elements are shared by all cultures and an effort is being made to demonstrate the cross-cultural applicability of \"the Big Five\". Cross-cultural assessment depends on the universality of personality traits, which is whether there are common traits among humans regardless of culture or other factors. If there is a common foundation of personality, then it can be studied on the basis of human traits rather than within certain cultures. This can be measured by comparing whether assessment tools are measuring similar constructs across countries or cultures. Two approaches to researching personality are looking at emic and etic traits. Emic traits are constructs unique to each culture, which are determined by local customs, thoughts, beliefs, and characteristics. Etic traits are considered universal constructs, which establish traits that are evident across cultures that represent a biological basis of human personality. If personality traits are unique to the individual culture, then different traits should be apparent in different cultures. However, the idea that personality traits are universal across cultures is supported by establishing the Five-Factor Model of personality across multiple translations of the NEO-PI-R, which is one of the most widely used personality measures. When administering the NEO-PI-R to 7,134 people across six languages, the results show a similar pattern of the same five underlying constructs that are found in the American factor structure. Similar results were found using the Big Five Inventory (BFI), as it was administered in 56 nations across 28 languages. The five factors continued to be supported both conceptually and statistically across major regions of the world, suggesting that these underlying factors are common across cultures. There are some differences across culture, but they may be a consequence of using a lexical approach to study personality structures, as language has limitations in translation and different cultures have unique words to describe emotion or situations. Differences across cultures could be due to real cultural differences, but they could also be consequences of poor translations, biased sampling, or differences in response styles across cultures. Examining personality questionnaires developed within a culture can also be useful evidence for the universality of traits across cultures, as the same underlying factors can still be found. Results from several European and Asian studies have found overlapping dimensions with the Five-Factor Model as well as additional culture-unique dimensions. Finding similar factors across cultures provides support for the universality of personality trait structure, but more research is necessary to gain stronger support."

        "content": "The modern sense of individual personality is a result of the shifts in culture originating in the Renaissance, an essential element in modernity. In contrast, the Medieval European's sense of self was linked to a network of social roles: \"the household, the Kinship network, the guild, the corporation \u2013 these were the building blocks of personhood\". Stephen Greenblatt observes, in recounting the recovery (1417) and career of Lucretius' poem De rerum natura: \"at the core of the poem lay key principles of a modern understanding of the world.\" \"Dependent on the family, the individual alone was nothing,\" Jacques G\u00e9lis observes. \"The characteristic mark of the modern man has two parts: one internal, the other external; one dealing with his environment, the other with his attitudes, values, and feelings.\" Rather than being linked to a network of social roles, the modern man is largely influenced by the environmental factors such as: \"urbanization, education, mass communication, industrialization, and politicization.\" In 2006, for example, scientists reported a relationship between personality and political views as follows: \"Preschool children who 20 years later were relatively liberal were characterized as: developing close relationships, self-reliant, energetic, somewhat dominating, relatively under-controlled, and resilient. Preschool children subsequently relatively conservative at age 23 were described as: feeling easily victimized, easily offended, indecisive, fearful, rigid, inhibited, and relatively over-controlled and vulnerable.\""

Despite seeking only impersonal reasons for their conclusions, James argued, the temperament of philosophers influenced their philosophy. Temperament thus conceived is tantamount to a bias. Such bias, James explained, was a consequence of the trust philosophers place in their own temperament. James thought the significance of his observation lay on the premise that in philosophy an objective measure of success is whether philosophy is peculiar to its philosopher or not, and whether a philosopher is dissatisfied with any other way of seeing things or not."

In fact, James' lecture of 1907 fashioned a sort of trait theory of the empiricist and rationalist camps of philosophy. As in most modern trait theories, the traits of each camp are described by James as distinct and opposite, and maybe possessed in different proportions on a continuum, and thus characterize the personality of philosophers of each camp. The \"mental make-up\" (i.e. personality) of rationalist philosophers is described as \"tender-minded\" and \"going by \"principles,\" and that of empiricist philosophers is described as \"tough-minded\" and \"going by \"facts.\" James distinguishes each not only in terms of the philosophical claims they made in 1907, but by arguing that such claims are made primarily on the basis of temperament. Furthermore, such categorization was only incidental to James' purpose of explaining his pragmatist philosophy and is not exhaustive."

        "title": "Personality_Empiricists and rationalists",
        "content": "According to James, the temperament of rationalist philosophers differed fundamentally from the temperament of empiricist philosophers of his day. The tendency of rationalist philosophers toward refinement and superficiality never satisfied an empiricist temper of mind. Rationalism leads to the creation of closed systems, and such optimism is considered shallow by the fact-loving mind, for whom perfection is far off. Rationalism is regarded as pretension, and a temperament most inclined to abstraction. Empiricists, on the other hand, stick with the external senses rather than logic. British empiricist John Locke's  (1632\u20131704) explanation of personal identity provides an example of what James referred to. Locke explains the identity of a person, i.e. personality, on the basis of a precise definition of identity, by which the meaning of identity differs according to what it is being applied to. The identity of a person is quite distinct from the identity of a man, woman, or substance according to Locke. Locke concludes that consciousness is personality because it \"always accompanies thinking, it is that which makes everyone to be what he calls self,\" and remains constant in different places at different times. Rationalists conceived of the identity of persons differently than empiricists such as Locke who distinguished identity of substance, person, and life. According to Locke, Rene Descartes  (1596\u20131650) agreed only insofar as he did not argue that one immaterial spirit is the basis of the person \"for fear of making brutes thinking things too.\" According to James, Locke tolerated arguments that a soul was behind the consciousness of any person. However, Locke's successor David Hume (1711\u20131776), and empirical psychologists after him denied the soul except for being a term to describe the cohesion of inner lives. However, some research suggests Hume excluded personal identity from his opus An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding because he thought his argument was sufficient but not compelling. Descartes himself distinguished active and passive faculties of mind, each contributing to thinking and consciousness in different ways. The passive faculty, Descartes argued, simply receives, whereas the active faculty produces and forms ideas, but does not presuppose thought, and thus cannot be within the thinking thing. The active faculty mustn't be within self because ideas are produced without any awareness of them, and are sometimes produced against one's will. Rationalist philosopher Benedictus Spinoza (1632\u20131677) argued that ideas are the first element constituting the human mind, but existed only for actually existing things. In other words, ideas of non-existent things are without meaning for Spinoza, because an idea of a non-existent thing cannot exist. Further, Spinoza's rationalism argued that the mind does not know itself, except insofar as it perceives the \"ideas of the modifications of body,\" in describing its external perceptions, or perceptions from without. On the contrary, from within, Spinoza argued, perceptions connect various ideas clearly and distinctly. The mind is not the free cause of its actions for Spinoza. Spinoza equates the will with the understanding and explains the common distinction of these things as being two different things as an error which results from the individual's misunderstanding of the nature of thinking."

        "content": "A celebrity guest calls in (or occasionally appears on stage) to be interviewed by the host and the panelists as well as take a three-question multiple-choice quiz. In Wait Waits early years, \"Not My Job\" guests were mainly pulled from NPR's roster of personalities and reporters; the pool of guests later expanded to include guests of greater celebrity. As the segment's title suggests, the guests are quizzed on topics that are not normally associated with their field of work.  For example, former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was asked questions on the history of Hugh Hefner and Playboy magazine, while author Salman Rushdie was asked about the history of Pez candy. Often, the subject matter of the quizzes serve as an oblique yet comic juxtaposition to the guests' fields of work, such as when Mad Men creator/producer Matthew Weiner was quizzed on ways people try to cheer others up (\"Glad Men\") in a March 2015 appearance."

        "content": "The Filmfare Awards are a set of awards that honour artistic and technical excellence in the Hindi-language film industry of India. The Filmfare ceremony is one of the most famous film events in India. The awards were first introduced by the Filmfare magazine of The Times Group in 1954, the same year as the National Film Awards. They were initially referred to as the \"Clare Awards\" or \"The Clares\" after Clare Mendonca, the editor of The Times of India. A dual voting system was developed in 1956. Under this system, in contrast to the National Film Awards, which are decided by a panel appointed by the Indian Government, the Filmfare Awards are voted on by both the public and a committee of experts. The ceremony has been sponsored by various private organisations in the past as well as in present provisions. During several years in the 1990s, a live ceremony was broadcast to television audiences but was later discontinued due to unknown reasons. Since 2001, a recorded and edited version of the awards ceremony was televised on SET a week or two after the ceremony has been held. Since 2018, the ceremony has been televised on Colors. The 65th Filmfare Awards event was held on the 16th of February 2020 at Sarusajai Stadium, Guwahati. The Filmfare Awards have been often referred to as the Hindi film industry's equivalent to the Academy Awards in the United States. Until the mid-1990s, Filmfare Awards were the preeminent and most-recognised awards in Bollywood until several other awards sprouted up in Mumbai. This has resulted in poor viewership since the 2000s. In addition to the flagship event, Filmfare also has variants for other Indian film industries, such as Filmfare Awards South for South Indian cinema, Filmfare Marathi Awards for Marathi cinema, and Filmfare Awards East for eastern Indian cinema."

Readers of Filmfare were polled to decide the winners, and over 20,000 readers spread throughout India participated in the polls; trophies were given to winners of the popular vote. In the first awards function, held on 21 March 1954 at the Metro Theatre of Mumbai, only five awards were presented: Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Music Director. Do Bigha Zameen was the first movie to win the award for Best Film. The first winners for the other four categories were: Bimal Roy for his direction of Do Bigha Zameen, Dilip Kumar for his performance in Daag, Meena Kumari for her performance in Baiju Bawra, and Naushad Ali for his music in Baiju Bawra. The Filmfare Awards also introduced the Short Film Category in 2017, with Vidya Balan and Gauri Shinde on the jury. The People's Choice Award for Best Short Film was presented to Khamakha. Short films like Chutney, Matitali Kusti and Taandav won awards as well. Hollywood star Gregory Peck was invited to be the guest of honour at the first ever awards on 21 March 1954 at the Metro theatre, Mumbai but could not make it to the function since his flight from Colombo got delayed. However, Peck did attend the banquet that followed the award night at Wellington Club (Gymkhana), Mumbai."

Unfortunately, the Bombay Film Industry as it was known then, went on strike in 1986 because of its many contentious issues with the Government of Maharashtra. As a result, the ceremony was pushed to the next year. The winners of 1985 were awarded on 28 January 1987. For security reasons, the Filmfare was not awarded for 1986 and 1987."

Originally designed by N.G. Pansare under the supervision of Times of India'''s art director Walter Langhammer, it is generally made of bronze, its height is 46.5\u00a0cm and it weighs around 5 kg. To celebrate the 25th year of the awards, the statues were made in silver and to celebrate the 50th year the statues were made in gold. The Filmfare trophy is manufactured by The Award Gallery since 2000. Until 2012, there had only been a few changes made to the trophy. But more recently, as of 2013, a huge change has been made to give the trophy a 3-D look. There were two reasons given for this change. First of all, the organisers believe that it was necessary to match the many advances in technology in today's world, which will advance a lot more in the coming years as well. This was also an attempt to match the theme of the 2013 set of awards at Filmfare in Mumbai: a hundred years leap into the future."

        "content": "The Academy wanted to find a new venue for the festivities amid limited seating and rehearsal time concerns with the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. In addition, problems arose regarding staging the Oscars at the Shrine Auditorium because there was difficulty of directing guests from the auditorium where the main event took place to the adjacent Exhibition Hall for the Governor's Ball. In August 1997, AMPAS and Canadian development firm TrizecHahn went into negotiations over the development of an entertainment complex located on the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue adjacent to the Mann's Chinese Theatre. Seven months later, both the Academy and TrizecHahn agreed on a twenty-year lease that allowed for the ceremony to be staged at a new venue, which would later be called the Kodak Theatre, located within the property which was also situated near the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel site of the inaugural awards ceremony in 1929. This was the first time the ceremony was held in Hollywood since the 32nd ceremony took place at the Pantages Theatre in 1960. In view of the return of the Oscars to Hollywood, the Academy hired film producer and Sony Pictures Entertainment chairman Laura Ziskin in September 2001 to oversee production of the telecast. AMPAS president Frank Pierson explained the decision to hire Ziskin saying, \"This show is one of the most difficult\u2014if not the most difficult\u2014producing jobs in show business. Laura Ziskin brings intelligence, experience and wit expressed in everything she has done.\" This marked the first occurrence that a woman produced the Oscars solo. Four months later, Whoopi Goldberg was selected as host of the 2002 ceremony. In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Ziskin justified her choice of Goldberg commenting that she has \"great warmth, with humor, humanity and social conscience, all qualities that I feel are essential for this year's show. I look forward to collaborating with Whoopi to put on a meaningful and entertaining evening.\" Furthermore, the September 11 attacks affected the telecast and its surrounding events. Despite speculation and suggestions that the festivities be postponed or canceled, AMPAS President Pierson wrote in a Variety column refusing to take such action stating that it would send the message that \"the terrorists have won\". However, due to security concerns the Academy announced that red carpet bleacher seats would now be limited on a reservation basis based on a random selection and a background check. On Oscar night, Tom Cruise opened the show and stated that it was the job of filmmakers to make films during troubling times. In addition, later in the evening Oscar host Whoopi Goldberg introduced a \"New York icon\" to the stage and filmmaker and director Woody Allen, who had previously refused to attend a ceremony, made a surprise appearance. He was greeted with a hearty standing ovation from audience members including Baz Luhrmann, Ron Howard, Jennifer Connelly, Denzel Washington, and Ethan Hawke. He explained after the events that happened that September he was there to represent the city he so loved and to plead filmmakers to continue to film in New York City. Woody then presented a film montage created by fellow New Yorker and screenwriter Nora Ephron saluting New York City in film. Several other people participated in the production of the ceremony. Actors Glenn Close and Donald Sutherland served as announcers during the show. The orchestra led by film composer and telecast musical supervisor John Williams, performed selections of film scores during a montage saluting film composers produced by Kyle Cooper. Filmmaker Errol Morris filmed a vignette featuring several famous people discuss movie memories. Director Penelope Spheeris produced a montage saluting 60 years of Oscar-winning documentary feature films. Cirque du Soleil performed a dance number inspired by movies and visual effects."

According to Academy communications director John Pavlik, the film must be at least 70 minutes in length, have a significant amount of animated characters, and be at least 75 percent animated in order to be qualified for consideration. A minimum of eight qualifying films must be released within the calendar year to permit a slate of three nominees. If the number of films exceeds twelve, the nominee roster increases to five. Prior to the introduction of this category, three Disney films (1937's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and 1995's Toy Story) were all given Special Achievement Academy Awards. The stars of the nominated films (Sulley and Mike from Monsters, Inc., Jimmy Neutron and Goddard from Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, and Shrek and Donkey from Shrek) also appeared via CGI, but were instructed by Nathan Lane to stay in their seats."

        "content": "The show received a mixed reception from media publications. Some media outlets were more critical of the show. Television critic Robert Bianco of USA Today complained that the awards ceremony was \"intensely narcissistic and characteristically, almost unrelievedly, dull.\" Columnist Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe bemoaned that \"TV's most-watched slug crawled back into town last night.\" He also sniped, \"As usual, the technical awards formed a Bermuda triangle in the middle of the show, and the film-clip fests and production numbers numbed our brains.\" The Sacramento Bees Rick Kishman lamented that \"It was the first time both best-acting Oscars went to African Americans...yet viewers had to fight hours and hours of boredom to care.\" He also quipped that the excessive amount of montage and tributes dragged down the proceedings. Other media outlets received the broadcast more positively. Orange County Register film critic Henry Sheehan praised Goldberg's performance as hosting writing that her \"ensuing entrance a la Moulin Rouge was a comparative triumph and her boom-boom-boom succession of jokes put the show right on track.\" Television columnist Joanne Ostrow of The Denver Post raved, \"The nearly five-hour telecast was stunning, historic, slick, efficient, and helped along by some knockout clothes.\" She also commented that Washington and Berry's acceptance speeches and the Sidney Poitier tribute added to the historic and emotional mood of the festivities. John Levesque of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer commended producer Ziskin for producing \"the best Oscar telecast this TV watcher can remember.\" In addition, he wrote that \"It was clear the 74th Academy Awards ceremony was something special: fresh, crisp, different from its predecessors.\""

        "content": "Strictly Come Dancing (informally known as Strictly) is a British television dance contest in which celebrities partner with professional dancers to compete in mainly ballroom and Latin dance. Each couple is scored by a panel of judges. The title of the show is a continuation of the long-running series Come Dancing, with an allusion to the film Strictly Ballroom. The format has been exported to 60 other countries\u2014under the title Dancing with the Stars\u2014licensed by BBC Worldwide, and led to a modern dance-themed spin-off Strictly Dance Fever. The Guinness World Records has named Strictly to be the world's most successful reality television format. The series is currently presented by Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman. The series has been broadcast on BBC One since 15 May 2004, typically on Saturday evenings with a following Sunday night results show. From series 2 onwards, the show has been broadcast in the run up to Christmas. With its high viewing figures, Strictly Come Dancing has become a significant programme on British television. Eighteen stand-alone Christmas specials and nineteen charity specials have also been produced. Since the fourth series, the show has aired in high definition. In April 2014, Sir Bruce Forsyth announced his retirement from presenting the main series. While intending to return as host for each Children in Need and Christmas special, he only did so for the Christmas special in 2014 and the Children in Need specials in 2014 and 2015. He recorded a video message for the 2015 Christmas special as he was unable to appear due to illness. Forsyth died on 18 August 2017, aged 89."

Later, entertainment executive Fenia Vardanis also suggested reviving Come Dancing, so Jane Lush, the then head of BBC Entertainment, put Hopkins and Vardanis together to develop the show. Hopkins then called in Karen Smith, who had just produced Comic Relief Does Fame Academy for BBC One and The Games for Channel 4, to help lead the development of the show and launch the series. Smith was the show-running Executive Producer of the first three series, and of sister show It Takes Two. She then took the role of Creative Director of BBC Entertainment whilst still overseeing series 4 and 5. Hopkins later took the format to America himself when the BBC dismissed the idea of selling it abroad, as they felt it was too British."

From series 8 to 11, Forsyth only presented the main show and was replaced for the results show by Claudia Winkleman, at which point Daly assumed Forsyth's role as main presenter and Winkleman assumed Daly's role as co-presenter. Winkleman has joined Daly as full-time co-presenter for series 12 following Forsyth's departure after the 2013 series. Through telephone voting, viewers vote for who they would like to be in the next round, the results of the poll being combined with the ranking of the judges. For example, with ten contestants left, the judges' favourite would receive ten points, second favourite nine points, and so on, and similarly with the viewers' rankings. The bottom ranked couple gets one point. The profits from the telephone lines were donated to Sport Relief in series 1, to Children in Need from series 2, until series 8 when donations to charity stopped. The show is broadcast live on BBC One on Saturday evenings, and is currently presented by Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman (with Zoe Ball covering for Winkleman for a number of weeks in 2014). Sir Bruce Forsyth presented the live shows alongside Daly from 2004 to 2013, announcing his departure in 2014. He was to continue to present special editions of the show. For some of the second series, Natasha Kaplinsky stood in temporarily for Daly while she took maternity leave; Claudia Winkleman hosted the results show and editions that Forsyth had missed between 2010 and 2013. The judging panel initially consisted of Bruno Tonioli, Arlene Phillips, Len Goodman and Craig Revel Horwood. Alesha Dixon took Phillips' place from series 7 to 9, after which she left the programme to judge Britain's Got Talent which led retired ballerina Dame Darcey Bussell to replace her. Bussell remained a judge alongside Goodman, Tonioli and Horwood until 2018. Tonioli commutes weekly between Hollywood and London to judge both the American and British versions of the show simultaneously. Each judge gives the performance a mark out of ten, giving an overall total out of forty. The voice-over announcer is Alan Dedicoat. During series four, an hour-long highlights show was shown on Sundays at 19:00 on BBC Two, and during series five and six, the results show moved to Sunday evenings, although it was filmed on Saturday and then broadcast \"as live\" on the Sunday. The singers on the show are Tommy Blaize, Hayley Sanderson, Lance Ellington, Andrea Grant and, formerly, the well-known British dance music vocalist Tara McDonald. The music director is David Arch. Tommy Blaize has been part of Strictly since its beginning. David Arch joined in the fourth series and Hayley Sanderson in the fifth. In the seventeenth series, the singers were joined by Mitchell. The show was broadcast from a specially constructed set at BBC Television Centre (primarily in the largest studio, TC1) until its closure in 2013, with the show moving to Elstree Studios' George Lucas Stage 2 from 2013 onwards. However, in the first two series, shows were also filmed at the Tower Ballroom in Blackpool, where the original Come Dancing series was filmed in the 1970s. In the second series, two shows were filmed at the Tower Ballroom \u2014 show five and the Grand Final, which was broadcast live on 11 December 2004. In 2005 though the BBC announced that they would not be returning to the venue for the third series due to \"logistical problems\". In October 2008, Craig Revel Horwood called for the series to return to the Tower Ballroom, saying, \"The atmosphere was electric. It's huge and has so much history. The Tower Ballroom puts a lot of pressure on the professionals and the celebrities to perform to the best of their potential. What a wonderful place to go live to 12 million people. We have got to get the BBC to bring Strictly Come Dancing back to Blackpool.\" Eventually, for series 7, the show did return to the Tower Ballroom, where Blackpool-born Craig Kelly was eliminated. The episode was aired live on 7 November 2009. Strictly Come Dancing returned to Blackpool for the 2010 and 2011 series. After series 10, when Strictly Come Dancing did not go to Blackpool, they announced that they would return for series 11."

In the fourth and fifth weeks of series 18, he was a guest judge while regular judge Motsi Mabuse was self-isolating, before taking on the role officially in series 19 due to the absence of Bruno Tonioli. Only four professionals have won in their first series of being a Strictly professional: Brendan Cole (Series 1), Darren Bennett (Series 2), Artem Chigvintsev (Series 8) and Alja\u017e \u0160korjanec (series 11) Only four professionals have won in their last series of being a Strictly professional: Camilla Dallerup (Series 6), Flavia Cacace (Series 10), Aliona Vilani (series 13) and Joanne Clifton (series 14). Following his departure from the professional cast, Ian Waite made regular appearances on the companion programme It Takes Two until 2020. Waite and Darren Bennett both participated in the professional dance troupe in series 8, and Waite stood in as a temporary dance partner in series 8 due to the unavailability of Brendan Cole. Iveta Lukosiute initially joined the show to partner Johnny Ball in series 10 after his original partner, Aliona Vilani, was injured in training. She then became part of the main cast for series 11. In series 11, having previously been announced to be leaving the show, Vilani subsequently replaced Natalie Lowe, who was injured before the start of the series. The producers of the show announced this on 2 September 2013. Vilani is the only professional to have been eliminated first twice in a row, with Tony Jacklin in series 11 and Gregg Wallace in series 12. Vilani & Oti Mabuse are the only professionals to have won more than one series. Mabuse is the only professional to have won twice in a row. Kevin Clifton has had the most appearances in the final of any professional, with five (2013\u201316, 2018). He is also the only pro to have reached more than two finals in a row, appearing in four consecutive finals in total. Since series 13, the show has had more professional dancers than celebrities to partner them with. In this and in subsequent series, the following professionals have been without celebrity partners:"

The Waltz, Cha Cha Cha, Quickstep, Rumba, Tango, Jive, Foxtrot, Paso Doble and Samba have all been danced since series 1. The American Smooth and Viennese Waltz were added in series 3. The Salsa and Argentine Tango were added in series 4. No more dances were added until series 7, in week 11, when couples performed either a Charleston (which winner Chris Hollins chose to perform again in the final) or a Rock N' Roll routine. The final also featured a head-to-head Lindyhop. Of these dances, only the Charleston was retained for subsequent series, although elements of the Lindyhop have often featured in Showdances. Series 8 introduced the Swing-a-thon, where all remaining couples danced Swing simultaneously and were voted off the dancefloor one by one by the judges until only one couple remained. This returned in series 9 and 11. The tenth series featured a \"Dance Fusion\", in which the couples attempted to perform two dances consecutively in one routine. The twelfth series introduced the Waltz-a-thon, which used the same manner as the Swing-a-thon: all remaining couples danced the Waltz on the dance floor at the same time. Afterwards, the results were revealed by the judges. The thirteenth series introduced a Quickstep-a-thon, in which all seven remaining couples simultaneously danced the Quickstep. The judges then ranked them from one to seven and gave points accordingly. The fourteenth series saw the Cha-Cha-Challenge introduced, in which all six remaining couples simultaneously danced the Cha-Cha-Cha. The judges then ranked them from one to six and gave points accordingly. The fifteenth series saw the Paso Doble-thon introduced, in which all seven remaining couples simultaneously performed a Paso Doble. The judges then ranked them one to seven and gave points accordingly. The sixteenth series saw the Lindy-Hop-athon introduced, in which all seven remaining couples simultaneously performed the Lindy Hop. The judges then ranked them from one to seven and gave points accordingly. The sixteenth series introduced Contemporary, Jazz, and Street/Commercial dances as part of a \"couples' choice\" category. A Showdance (Freestyle) has always been performed in the series final as a last chance for couples to impress the public. From series 2 to 7, the Showdance was not scored by the judges. From series 8 to series 18, the Showdance was performed as each couple's second dance in the final. Prior to series 10, the dances performed in the early weeks were switched between one Ballroom and one Latin, and were divided as evenly as possible depending on the number of contestants left. As the competition progressed further, this system was abandoned and many styles, not just two, could be performed in one week by each of the remaining contestants. From series 4 to 7, the remaining contestants who made it to the semi-final were granted to perform the semi-final-exclusive Argentine Tango. As of series 10, the contestants are now allowed to perform any of the chosen dances in any week, though the Argentine Tango remains generally reserved for the latter stages of the competition. The Showdance, however, continues to only be performed in the final."

There are two couples in each dance-off: the two who received the lowest totals that week from the combined judges' scores and public vote. The aim of the dance-off is for the couples to convince the judges that they deserve to go through to the following week's competition. Before they attempt their dance a second time, the couple sometimes gets advice from the judges. The judges decide who continues in the competition and who is eliminated based on the dance-off performances. If three of the judges agree that one of the couples should be saved, that couple is through to the following week's competition and the Head Judge's vote is not counted. If one couple has two votes and the other couple has one vote, then the deciding vote is cast by the Head Judge, originally Len Goodman and currently Shirley Ballas. Afterwards, the eliminated couple perform one final dance \u2014 sometimes known as \"waltzing out of the ballroom\". The Monday after their elimination, they appear on It Takes Two to discuss their time on the programme. The dance-off has been cancelled only once, in series 14, due to an injury sustained earlier by one of the celebrity contestants, Anastacia. She was unable to perform the dance-off and the couple with the lowest combined total was eliminated."

The show featured 14 new celebrities, who were paired with 14 professional dancers. In a change to the previous format, the results show was recorded on Saturday and broadcast on Sunday, rather than shown live later on Saturday. In addition to this, the two couples who were at the bottom of the table after the public vote were subject to a dance-off, where they reprised their routine for the judges to decide who should leave the competition. Head Judge Len Goodman had the casting vote in the event of a tie. The series raised just over one million pounds for Children in Need."

After all three had performed and the judges had given their scores, two of the couples were in joint-first position on the leaderboard, while the third \u2014 Tom Chambers and Camilla Dallerup \u2014 were in last place. This meant that, no matter how many public votes were cast in their favour, it was mathematically impossible for the third-placed couple to remain in the competition. This oversight was initially unnoticed by producers until after the public vote became live and viewers were invited to call in and save their favourites at a cost of 15p per vote. Once the mistake was finally realised and the public vote was closed, it was announced that all three couples would be put through to the final, all the votes already cast would count towards the final result of the competition, and viewers could apply for a refund if they wished. The BBC received 1800 complaints about the incident, while media regulator Ofcom received 297. Jon Beazley, the BBC's Head of Entertainment Production, was interviewed on Strictly's spin-off show Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two on 15 December. He apologised for the oversight, referring to it as an \"unprecedented situation\". On the same day, the BBC posted a statement on its website, which clarified that an independent adjudicator had been consulted to reach a solution that would offer \"fairness to the viewers who voted and the contestants themselves\". The BBC also stated that, following the mistake, \"the voting and judging mechanisms used in all BBC voting programmes [had] been thoroughly examined\". After conducting an investigation, Ofcom concluded that \"the mistake had resulted from an oversight, rather than any shortcomings in the technical arrangements for voting or in the handling of votes received\", and that they were \"satisfied that appropriate steps were taken by the BBC and the disadvantage to viewers minimised\". Ofcom also opined that \"the BBC had been open and transparent with viewers about the mistake it made and the solution adopted\"."

        "content": "In June 2009, tabloid newspaper The Sun reported that the then 66-year-old judge Arlene Phillips, who had judged the show since its inception in 2004, was to be replaced by series five winner Alesha Dixon, then aged 30. This was later confirmed by the BBC in July of that year. Subsequently, the BBC was accused of ageism and sexism by several sources, an accusation the corporation has faced before over the removal of several older female presenters, including Moira Stuart, Juliet Morris, Miriam O'Reilly, Michaela Strachan, Charlotte Smith and Anna Ford. The BBC denied the allegations that the decision to remove Phillips was due to her age. Furthermore, Dixon herself was criticised after the debut episode of the seventh series, the first to feature her as a judge. A total of 272 complaints were received by the BBC \u2013 bringing the total number about Dixon joining the programme to over 4000 \u2013 along with over 5000 comments on Strictly Come Dancing's internet message board. Dixon was compared unfavourably to Phillips, with claims that the former was \"unsuitable\", \"unqualified\" and lacked \"knowledge, experience and talent\". However, Dixon was praised and defended from her critics by the BBC, by fellow judge Craig Revel Horwood and by Phillips herself."

Du Beke claimed that the comment, which was never broadcast, was a joke referring to Rouass' spray-tan, in which he said that she \"looked like a Paki\". Over 600 complaints were received by the BBC, including those about comments Bruce Forsyth, then host of Strictly Come Dancing, made about the controversy on a Talksport radio programme, in which he suggested that Britain \"used to have a sense of humour\" about such incidents, and that Du Beke's apology should be accepted. Following the incident, and Forsyth's response, the BBC stated:Racially offensive language in the workplace is entirely unacceptable. Anton was right to apologise quickly and without reservation and Laila has wholly accepted his apology. Everyone is very clear that there can be no repetition of this behaviour.Forsyth also clarified his position:What Anton said to Laila was wrong and he has apologised unreservedly for this. Nor do I in any way excuse or condone the use of such language. To be absolutely clear, the use of racially offensive language is never either funny or acceptable. However, there is a major difference between this and racist comments which are malicious in intent and whilst I accept that we live in a world of extraordinary political correctness, we should keep things in perspective."

The BBC denied that de Mooi had ever been under consideration for the show, and also declared that \"Strictly is a family show and we have chosen the traditional format of mixed-sex couples\". The press has reported on the issue on numerous occasions when gay celebrities have appeared on the show, including Will Young, Susan Calman, Robert Rinder, Richard Coles and Ranj Singh. Strictly Come Dancing judges Shirley Ballas and Craig Revel Horwood have both expressed their support for introducing same-sex couples. Same-sex partnerships have been featured on several international versions of the show, including Austria (2011), Italy (2015), Australia (2019) and Germany (2019).  On 3 November 2019, Johannes Radebe and fellow professional Graziano Di Prima performed together to Emeli Sande's \"Shine\" on the Sunday results episode, the show's first individual same-sex dance. On 2 September 2020, it was announced that boxer Nicola Adams would feature in the show's first same-sex couple for its eighteenth series. She was partnered with professional dancer Katya Jones. In 2021, it was announced that John Whaite would feature in the first all-male same-sex couple with Johannes Radebe for the nineteenth series. The United States version of the show would also have a same-sex couple that same year."

The English edition has aired each year since 2002, while the French edition aired annually from 2004 to 2014, and was then discontinued until being revived in 2018.

        "content": "During Canada Reads, five personalities champion five different books, each champion extolling the merits of one of the titles. The debate is broadcast over a series of five programs. At the end of each episode, the panelists vote one title out of the competition until only one book remains. This book is then billed as the book that all of Canada should read. CBC Radio producer, Peter Kavanagh, proposed the general idea of a national radio book campaign during the fall of 2001. Later that year, Talin Vartanian conceived Canada Reads and created the essential structure of the program: an annual campaign to select a book for the nation to read. She proposed the idea of five panelists, each championing a different title in a national on air debate. Vartanian was producer in the first edition (with Kavanagh), then she became executive producer from 2002 to 2007. In 2007 the program was an \"All Star Edition\", a reunion of the winning panelists from the first five years. From 2007 to 2017, Ann Jansen produced the program. Canada Reads was first broadcast on CBC's Radio One in 2002, and has aired annually on radio since then. The third and fourth editions also were broadcast on television, on CBC Newsworld. Broadcast dates were February 16 to February 20, 2004, and February 21 to February 25, 2005, respectively. The seventh edition was also broadcast on Bold TV, broadcasting from February 25 to February 29. Beginning with the third edition, the daily debates could be heard online as well as on Radio One. The fifth edition was broadcast from April 17 to April 21, 2006. The sixth edition aired February 25 to March 2, 2007. The seventh edition of Canada Reads was broadcast on February 25 to February 29, 2008 and for the first time, it was available as a podcast. The books in the running for each edition of Canada Reads are announced several months before the programs are broadcast. Titles must be Canadian fiction, poetry or plays. They are promoted in bookstores, in the hope that the Canada Reads audience will purchase and read them all before the programs air. In some cases, publishers have published special editions of the nominated titles. The publisher of the winning Canada Reads title donates a portion of sales proceeds from the winning book to a charitable organization working in the field of literacy. Recipients have included Frontier College, the Movement for Canadian Literacy, ABC Life Literacy Canada (formerly ABC CANADA Literacy Foundation) and Laubach Literacy of Canada. Beginning in 2004, Radio-Canada, the French-language service of CBC, produced a French version of Canada Reads entitled Le Combat des livres (\"Battle of the books\"). It was broadcast on Premi\u00e8re Cha\u00eene until 2014, following which it was discontinued for three years until being revived in 2018. Both the English and French programs sometimes, but not always, include one personality more commonly associated with the other language community, who champions a translated work. One advocate, Maureen McTeer,  has appeared on both programs in the same year, championing the same novel in both its original English and translated French editions. Several other novels have also been chosen for both programs, although their English and French versions were not chosen by the same advocate or in the same year; one novel to date, Lawrence Hill's The Book of Negroes (French title Aminata) has won both competitions."

        "content": "As a vehicle to promote interest in reading and books and to increase sales, Canada Reads has been a signal success. Even already successful titles see increases in sales driven by their inclusion in the contest: sales of Michael Ondaatje's In the Skin of a Lion increased by 80,000 in 2002, the year of its appearance on Canada Reads. Its publisher, Random House of Canada attributed much of this increase to Canada Reads. The success for lesser known titles can be as marked. Hubert Aquin's Next Episode sold 18,500 copies in the year when it won Canada Reads. For the 2005 edition, sales of Jacques Poulin's Volkswagen Blues, which usually are about 200 copies a year, increased to 7,500 between the time the nominations were announced and the shows began airing. During the same period, 7,000 copies of Frank Parker Day's Rockbound were shipped by its publisher, the University of Toronto Press."

        "content": "There has been some criticism of Canada Reads. First, criticism has been made of the use of \"celebrity\" panelists. In 2007, a listener named John Mutford unsuccessfully attempted to become the first non-celebrity panelist. Critics have also taken issue with the game show format, and have contended that discussion of the books has often remained on a superficial level. The choice of books has also been criticized. Originally each panelist provided a list of five books, from which the producers chose the final contenders. In 2005, this process changed, and the panelists submitted only one choice. Due to scheduling problems, Rufus Wainwright was not able to appear after selecting his choice, and singer Molly Johnson was chosen to defend his chosen book."

        "content": "The Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards (also known as the KCAs or  Kids' Choice) is an annual U.S. children's awards ceremony show that is produced by Nickelodeon. Usually held on a Saturday night in late March or early April, the show honors the year's biggest in television, film, music, and sports as voted by viewers worldwide of Nickelodeon networks. Winners receive a hollow orange blimp figurine, a logo outline for much of the network's 1984\u20132009 era, which also functions as a kaleidoscope. The show features numerous celebrity guests and musical acts. Since 2002, slime stunts have been incorporated into the show. The KCAs also host live entertainment.

        "content": "Alan Goodman, Albie Hecht, and Fred Seibert created the awards show after Nickelodeon produced a segment called The Big Ballot for the movie review show Rated K: For Kids by Kids in 1987, named for the ballots kids voted with. To vote, the viewers would send in ballots and then before the show, the ballots would be counted and the winners would tape a \"thank you\" video that would be shown during the program. Goodman, Hecht, and Seibert felt that the network needed a bigger, more exciting platform. Hecht selected the awards logo from a series of network designs created by original logo designers Tom Corey and Scott Nash (Corey McPherson Nash, Boston), overseen by Goodman and Seibert (Fred/Alan, Inc., New York). The award was configured into the current blimp shape/kaleidoscope in 1990. The only change to the award since then has been a change to the embossed logotype on the side of the trophy for 2010 to fit the network's new logo typeface. As the Internet came into widespread use, the voting finally moved from a combination of 900 number telephone voting and filling paper ballots that were either mailed or completed at Pizza Hut locations, to being conducted exclusively on the network's website, and included text messaging by 2007. During the early years of Internet voting, there were several issues, including the digital equivalent of ballot stuffing and adult voting. As a result, a new system was put into place where one vote per Nick.com account is allowed (although it is probable adults still cast votes via the texting option, which is connected to a phone number only instead of a screen name, by creating an account with a false age, or by having their children vote for a chosen subject instead). In 2010, an iPhone application and mobile browser voting were also added. The 2009 Kids' Choice Awards featured a new award called \"The Big Green Help Award\" which goes to the celebrity who goes above and beyond to help the Earth. The inaugural award was presented to Leonardo DiCaprio. For the 2010 awards, \"The Big Green Help\" award was renamed \"The Big Help\" award, with First Lady Michelle Obama winning the first award under the rename. Unlike traditional awards shows, the Kids' Choice Awards uses other items to announce an award winner instead of a traditional envelope. The show sometimes uses balloons, T-shirts, models, giant letters, stickers, and even a foot. Voting became available for Canadian people in time for the 2010 ceremony, owing to the inauguration of Nickelodeon's Canadian service in November 2009. In June 2010, Nickelodeon Latin America announced a Kids' Choice Awards for Mexico. Other countries with their own Kids' Choice Awards include Brazil, United Kingdom, Australia, and Indonesia, which are either fully original local productions, or inserted as continuity during their broadcast of the U.S. ceremony. The Australian Kids' Choice Awards had its final local ceremony in 2012. In August 2011, Nickelodeon Latin America announced a Kids' Choice Awards event for Argentina. In June 2014, Nickelodeon Latin America announced a Kids' Choice Awards event for Colombia. The 2020 ceremony was the first ceremony to be held in a virtual format, a change that was necessary in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic."

After renovations to Pauley beginning in 2011, the show was moved to the Galen Center at USC; it was expected to be a temporary home, but the network retained Galen for the 2012\u201314 ceremonies due to the construction of the Meyer and Renee Luskin Conference and Guest Center, making it difficult to have the \"Orange Carpet\"; the smaller Kids' Choice Sports had its first ceremony in 2014 at Pauley. For the 2015 and 2016 shows, the ceremony occurred at the remodeled Forum in Inglewood, California. Between the 2017 and 2019 shows, the venue alternated between the Galen Center and The Forum. The 2020 awards, previously scheduled for March 22, were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic; a spokesperson said that Nickelodeon \"will have further information about a new date in the future.\" The ceremony was later moved to May 2 to be held virtually.

Hosts of the show have also been slimed, and occasionally celebrities not attending the awards have been slimed via video segment, such as when Rosie O'Donnell tricked Melissa Joan Hart into getting slimed on the set of Sabrina the Teenage Witch in 2001, or when Amanda Seyfried and Josh Hutcherson were slimed at a KCA watch party in 2013. Celebrities sitting in the audience are also fair game for being slimed, as Mandy Moore first learned in 2007, and Halle Berry later found out in 2012. Although Les Lye was the only celebrity to be slimed at the 1988 awards, a video was shown during the show of then Nickelodeon president Geraldine Laybourne saying the magic words and getting slimed with the original YCDTOTV recipe, much to her dismay, proving that not even the network president was safe from the slime. Below is a list of all the celebrities that have been slimed over the past years at the Kids' Choice Awards."

Jones immediately selected actress and comedian Whoopi Goldberg to host the ceremony. In an interview with Los Angeles Times writer Susan King, Jones explained the decision to hire Goldberg saying, \"She has all the qualifications to move on a dime, to carry the elegance and the dignity of the show and is very funny. She understands the street. She has everything.\" One segment that was staged during the ceremony was an elaborate fashion show showcasing the nominees for Best Costume Design. Produced by fashion photographer Matthew Rolston, the production featured models such as Cameron Alborzian, Tyson Beckford, Tyra Banks, Marcus Schenkenberg and Joel West sporting various costumes from the five films nominated in the category. Initially, actor Jack Nicholson was approached to introduce the segment along with models Naomi Campbell and Claudia Schiffer. However, actor Pierce Brosnan accepted the role of presenter of the segment and award after Nicholson declined those respective duties. Several other people and elements were also involved with the production of the ceremony. Jeff Margolis served as director for the program. Actress and talk show host Oprah Winfrey interviewed several nominees and other attendees during a seven-minute red carpet arrival segment shown at the beginning of the telecast. Musician and saxophonist Tom Scott served as musical director for the ceremony. Choreographer Jamie King supervised the performances of the Best Song nominees and two dance numbers.

Jackson further pointed out the disparity in racial minorities in Hollywood by noting that Best Live Action Short Film nominee Dianne Houston was the only African American nominated that year.

Chicago Tribune television critic Steve Johnson lamented that Goldberg \"settled into bland script reading that made one long for David Letterman's cranky unpredictability in the role last year.\" He also stated that the \"Best Costume Design fashion show\" was the silliest opening Oscar production number since Rob Lowe and Snow White sang \"Proud Mary\" in 1989.

Between 1995 and 2003, the Special Achievement Award is given to one artiste who have made significant contributions in the performance of his/her respective field of profession over the past few years. The award was discontinued in 2004 until it revived again in 2018 with Marcus Chin receiving the award. Also, each ceremony ends with the Best Actor and Actress award, but recent ceremonies' last award would be Top 10 Most Popular Male or Female Artistes award, a popularity contest open for all nominated Mediacorp Artistes. Beginning in the 1998 ceremony, the variety categories were introduced in the awards, and variety programmes, as well as the artistes playing a role in these programmes were now made eligible; these includes Sitcoms, Variety Programme Hosts, and Variety Special (a one-off episode with a longer runtime, such as awards ceremony or live finals). For the first time in the awards' history, Technical Categories were also presented, but they were taped outside the ceremony on a separate date, and presented on a clip montage due to time constraints; these practice would later be done on later years except for 2010\u201315, where it was done on a single show instead. The 2000 ceremony further added awards in recognition to News and Current Affairs team and the Top Rated Drama Serial and Variety Programme. Beginning in the 2004 ceremony, the All-Time Favourite Artiste Award was introduced in the place of Special Achievement Award. Chew Chor Meng, Li Nanxing and Zoe Tay received the award after winning the Top 10 Most Popular Male or Female Artistes award from 1994\u20132003. It is given in honour of an artiste who has won the Top 10 Most Popular Male Artistes or Top 10 Most Popular Female Artistes for ten times (not necessary to be consecutive). Artistes who receive the award will no longer be eligible for the running of the respective Top 10 Most Popular Male or Female Artistes awards from that particular year onwards, allowing younger MediaCorp artistes have a chance to win the popularity awards as well. 21 artistes had won the All-Time Favourite Artiste award since its award inception, and it have been awarded in almost every year except 2007, 2013 and 2018. The ceremonies were held annually in April to honour television talents from works from the previous year; prior to the 2007 ceremony, the ceremony were held at the end of the year while there is no ceremony in 2008 due to a format change. In the 2010 ceremony, held in 2010, introduced the six awards, Favourite Male Character, Favourite Female Character, Most Unforgettable TV Villain, Male Media Darling, Female Media Darling and Rocket Award. The first three awards were decided by online voting with the results being announced during the first ceremony. The Rocket Award was also introduced, which mainly focuses on the artiste who contributed the most improvement throughout the past year. In 2014, the 20th Star Awards ceremony was held. The title of the Star Awards also short-formed to Star Awards 20 as a remarkable awards night. The first ceremony was held at the MediaCorp TV Theatre with the veteran artistes; Chen Shucheng who was the first Star Awards hosts came back as a co-hosts after 20 years hosting the first ceremony. Samuel Chong, Dasmond Koh, Vivian Lai, Lee Teng, Pornsak, Zhang Wei and Zhou Ruzhu and was held at the MediaCorp TV Theatre. Social Media Award and The Most Popular Regional Artiste Award were introduced at the ceremony. The second ceremony was held at Suntec Singapore International Convention and Exhibition Centre with hosts Guo Liang and Quan Yi Fong. 2014 also saw a revision of quota towards the category, as categories requires at least ten nominations in order to be presented; this result in the suspension of three awards, Best News Presenter, Best Current Affairs Presenter, and Best Newcomer. However, despite 8World (renamed from the Channel 8 News and Current Affairs Team in January 2019) had fulfilled the minimum quota of 10 nominations, these awards have yet to be presented since its last presentation in 2013, while Best Newcomer returned except for 2016 and 2017, both of which were not presented due to the same reason. In 2015, both ceremony was held on 19 April 2015 and 26 April 2015. It's the last year that Mediacorp presented the awards at the venue of Caldecott Broadcast Centre, MediaCorp TV Theatre (hence the Caldecott subtitle was present in the name of ceremony). Both ceremonies were held in the venue before moving to MediaCorp campus at 1 Stars Avenue for the next ceremony. At the 2016 ceremony, the Professional and Technical awards  have been moved to a backstage awards and also the last time it held a double ceremony (not counting prelude or special episodes). The online Favourite award categories were held for the final time, with Jeanette Aw nominated again for Favourite Female Character and Favourite Onscreen Couple (Drama). Aw won six voting-based awards in Show 1 in 2015 including three Most Popular Regional Artiste Awards, Social Media Award and Favourite Female Character award for her role in The Journey: Tumultuous Times. Aw expressed her intention to be removed from the voting, but was rejected as Mediacorp said that the awards were determined though online voting, and still requiring her to participate. There was a change in lineup of the awards streamlined to 19 categories. A new category, 'Best Programme Host', was created with a merger of two hosting awards (Best Variety Show Host and Best Info-Ed Programme Host) due to a similar presentation style in both the variety and info-ed programmes, as well as similar eligibility criteria. 'Best Evergreen Artiste', which was based on the performances for drama veterans, was also introduced in 2016. At the 2017 ceremony, online voting categories were also streamlined, by putting more emphasis placed on the Top 10 Most Popular Artiste awards, while the Favourite Male and Female Character, and Favourite Onscreen Couple awards, as well as Social Media Award were dropped due to the change. Due to the switch in measuring television viewership, the Top Rated Variety Programme and Top Rated Drama Serial awards were also suspended. The 2018 ceremony saw revamps towards the Top 10 Popularity Awards, whereas a poll of 1,000 people representing a wide demographic across Singapore's population, were conducted independently by an accredited market research company, will be used to shortlist the nominations. The results of the poll weighed 50% towards the combined total, while the other 50% comes from the public vote (with 50% weighed on telepoll and online votes each). Eligibility criteria for performance and popularity categories were also revised, opening up to non-Mediacorp artistes; eligible artistes were now required to lead a role in a programme or play as a supporting role/assistant host in at least three eligible programmes or at least 30 episodes out of all eligible programmes, whichever applicable. Best Evergreen Artiste were also accessed on veteran artistes based on a full calendar year, as opposed to a single programme. The 2019 ceremony, coinciding the silver jubilee of the ceremony on 14 April 2019, introduced two categories to feature miniseries, which were the Best Short-form Drama Serial and Best Short-form Variety Programme. The recent edition of the Star Awards 2021, initially announced to be held on 26 April 2020 and announced that the event is postponed to the second half of 2020 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, making it the first ceremony in 13 years since the revision of the eligibility period in 2008 where the ceremony would not be held on the month of April; On 7 August 2020, the ceremony was pushed to 18 April 2021 and expanding the eligibility to include 2020 programs, resulting in the increase of nominations for most of the award categories, from the traditional five to seven. The ceremony also introduces radio awards coinciding the 85th anniversary of radio broadcasting in Singapore. For the first time since 2014, the award ceremony was announced to be held outside studios, located on the Jewel Changi Airport and Terminal 4. Previously, technical category awards (e.g. Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Variety Show Producer, etc.), newscaster and current affairs awards and, for a time, the Young Talent Award (for child actors) were held separately at a gala dinner (or afternoon conference) due to time constraints and results and clips from the event would be shown either during the ceremony, or live-streaming before the ceremony. Between 2010 and 2015, and again in 2017, those technical awards were presented in Show 1 (or during the three prelude episodes, in 2017), while the Show 2 presented the main awards. Since 2016 (with the exception for 2017), the format was reverted with the technical category awards presented at an off-site ceremony. In accordance to the social distancing measures, the ceremony is conducted closed-doors, and international celebrities communicate via teleconference due to travel restrictions."

Between 2010 and 2015, the Professional and Technical awards (given out to backstage crew and scriptwriters) were telecast and presented in the first show, and the main awards on the second, airing the following week. While the first show was still held at MediaCorp TV Theatre, the second show was, for the third time in Star Awards history, being held on the new location of Resorts World Sentosa, after 1996 and 2006. Both of the ceremonies were broadcast live on 18 and 25 April 2010. The post-show was held after the second ceremony at 10pm on Channel U. In 2016, although the show was a two-part program, the technical awards was, for the first time since 2009, presented in an off-site non-televised presentation instead of being presented live in show 1. In their place, the main ceremony (which was presented in show 2) was also split into two shows, allowing to put more emphasis on mostly variety/info-ed award categories and drama award categories, for shows 1 and 2, respectively. The Post-show Party, airing after show 2, focuses on online voting award categories. For the first time in Star Awards history, the awards for the Top 10 Artistes were presented in separate shows instead of single show, with the female artistes awarded in show 1, and the male artistes on show 2. At the 2017 ceremony, in a gap of eight installments since 2009, the ceremony was revert to one show, and the post-show party was scrapped. In-lieu of the \"3+1\" change, a three-episode weekly preludes aired on Sundays before the main ceremony. The preludes were removed in 2018. With the merger of MediaCorp with SPH MediaWorks on 1 January 2005, nominees now include artistes and shows from MediaCorp Channel U, formerly MediaWork's Chinese language channel, and were broadcast for said channel since. Between 2010 and 2014, xinmsn provided its first online Live streaming for both the ceremony as well as backstage, and since 2013, Toggle (both the website and the smartphone/smart TV application). However, these streams were only viewable exclusive to Singapore. Starting from the 2019 ceremony, YouTube will also broadcast live streaming for the awards as well, and is viewable to the world."

        "content": "Due to the negative reception received from the preceding year's ceremony, actor Billy Crystal announced that after overseeing four consecutive Oscar ceremonies, he would not be hosting the 1994 telecast. In a statement released by his publicist, he stated, \"After three Grammys, four Oscars and six Comic Reliefs, I'm going to take a break from my hosting duties. I always felt honored to host the show and did my best to carry on the tradition of Bob Hope and Johnny Carson. I hope the new host has as good a time as I did.\" With Crystal absent to host the Oscars, many media outlets wondered whom producer Gil Cates would hire to emcee the program. Film columnist Jack Matthews suggested that actor Tom Hanks, who would eventually win Best Actor for Philadelphia, should host the show writing that he \"has charm, dignity, wit, intelligence and, it's worth mentioning, he's a movie star!\" Cates also offered the role to performers Steve Martin, Bette Midler, and Johnny Carson, but they all turned down the opportunity. After several days of speculation, Cates announced that he hired Oscar-winning actress and comedian Whoopi Goldberg to host the festivities for the first time. By virtue of her selection, Goldberg became both the first African American to host as well as the first woman to host the telecast solo. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Cates explained the decision to hire her saying, \"She is a highly recognizable star who has millions of fans.\" He also addressed the media's concerns regarding Goldberg's raunchy and outspoken humor stating, \"Some people may think she's potentially dangerous, and she says things that come to her mind. It's going to be exciting for me. The main thing is she wants to do it and she's smart. Whatever she says will be appropriate.\" Goldberg expressed that she was thrilled to be selected to emcee the 1994 ceremony commenting, \"To go from watching to winning to hosting in one lifetime is major.\" As with previous ceremonies he produced, Cates centered the show around a theme. This year, he christened the show with the theme \"People Behind the Camera\" commenting that \"It will be a salute to those unseen men and women who make what we see on the screen, the artist and craftspeople responsible for the magic of the movies.\" In tandem with the theme, the ceremony's opening number featured a montage produced by Chuck Workman saluting the many individuals such as directors, editors, and composers who are involved in moviemaking. During that segment, singer Bernadette Peters performing a modified version of Stephen Sondheim's song \"Putting It Together\" from his musical Sunday in the Park with George. Filmmaker and editor Carol A. Streit assembled another montage featuring a salute to the work of cinematographers and their contributions to film. Several other people and elements were also involved with the production of the ceremony. Production designer Roy Christopher designed a new stage for the ceremony which prominently featured five giant Oscar statues each flanked inside metal cones that were illuminated recurrently throughout the show. Film composer and musician Bill Conti served as musical director of the ceremony. Dancer Debbie Allen choreographed a dancer number showcasing the Best Original Score nominees featuring eight prestigious ballet and dance troupes from around the world."

The New York Times film critic Janet Maslin raved that the telecast had \"less silliness and less small talk, with more emphasis on cleverly chosen film clips and the bona fide Hollywood magic being celebrated.\" She also praised host Goldberg saying that she \"sustained a tone of levity, which became particularly important as the sweep by Schindler's List threatened to bring out great ponderousness in some quarters.\" Pittsburgh Post-Gazette television critic Robert Bianco commended Goldberg's performance writing that \"She never acted like she was too smart or to hip for the show she was hosting; she never smirked like there was a joke she alone was cool enough to get.\" He also extolled producer Cates by commenting, \"In place of the extraneous jokes and terrible production numbers, he gave us a theme that worked and a generous selection of clips to back it up.\" Anne Thompson of Entertainment Weekly lauded Goldberg by stating, \"Her elegant appearance (at least during the first half), her uncharacteristic restraint (she didn't cuss), and her ability to make it funny (despite the very somber speeches) made the ho-hum telecast worth watching.\" Some media outlets were more critical of the show. Television critic Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times lamented that Goldberg's humor \"wilted in a blessedly brief 3-hour-and-18-minute telecast.\" He also wrote that compared with Billy Crystal, her hosting skills were \"balmy\". Orlando Sentinel film critic Jay Boyar bemoaned that \"this year's Oscarcast was only a little more exciting than a wine snob droning on about his favorite vintages.\" Harold Schindler of The Salt Lake City Tribune remarked that Whoopi's preference for \"insider\" jokes \"left the audience murmuring and most viewers probably scratching their heads.\" He also added the biggest letdown of the telecast was \"Goldberg's seeming ineptness at understanding the moment\""

        "content": "After the success of the previous year's ceremony which won several Emmys and critical acclaim, the Academy rehired producer Gil Cates for the fourth consecutive year. In February 1993, actor and comedian Billy Crystal was chosen by Cates as host also for the fourth straight time. Cates justified the decision to hire him saying, \"He is a major movie star with a talent for moving the evening's entertainment along.\" According to an article by Army Archerd published in Variety, Crystal initially declined to host again citing his busy film schedule that included Mr. Saturday Night and City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold. However, after Cates sent him a funeral wreath with a poem declaring \"The show and I are dead without you\" followed by a head of a fake dead horse similar to one featured in the film The Godfather, Crystal accepted the role as emcee. As with previous ceremonies he produced, Cates centered the show around a theme. Inspired by the Year of the Woman in which a record four women were elected to the United States Senate, Cates christened the 1993 show with the theme \"Oscar Celebrates Women and the Movies\". In tandem with the theme, AMPAS gathered 67 female Oscar winners of every category for a photo that was later shown at the start of the telecast. Actress and singer Liza Minnelli performed \"Ladies' Day\", a song written by Fred Ebb and John Kander specifically for the broadcast. Oscar-winning documentarian Lynne Littman assembled a montage highlighting women in film. Several other people participated in the production of the ceremony. Bill Conti served as conductor and musical supervisor for the ceremony. Choreographer Debbie Allen supervised the Best Song nominee performances and the \"Ladies' Night\" musical number. Voice actress Randy Thomas served as announcer of the telecast becoming the first woman to do so."

He also questioned the purpose of the \"Year of the Woman\" theme writing, \"The Oscar show itself seemed at odds with its own feminist theme.\" Robert Bianco from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette derided Allen's musical production numbers, comparing them to the disastrous opening number at the 61st ceremony held in 1989. Columnist Matt Roush of USA Today complained, \"Crystal, in a by-now-familiar performance, has, in four years, taken a plum assignment and, by repetition, reduced it to shtick.\" He also wrote that, \"The song medley is getting old hat,\" and the \"smug references to his flop Mr. Saturday Night were out of an improv amateur night.\" The telecast also received unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures. In an interview with Los Angeles Daily News author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the \"Year of the Woman\" theme commenting, \"It had no basis in reality. On behalf of women directors, cinematographer, and producers, I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute.\" Likewise, President of the National Organization for Women's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony's feminist tribute as \"one of the most hypocritical, patronizing things I saw in my whole life.\" In response, Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating, \"The theme developed and raised consciousness in a way that I think is positive, not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically.\" He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying, \"It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness\" Despite the adverse reception, the ABC broadcast drew in an average of 45.7 million people over its length, which was a 3% increase from the previous year's ceremony. The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 31.2% of households watching over a 51 share. It also drew a higher 18\u201349 demo rating with a 20.1 rating among viewers in that demographic."

According to Variety columnist Army Archerd, Crystal planned to perform a bungee jump stunt as part of his entrance at the beginning of the ceremony. However, the act was scrapped due to high insurance costs for the Academy and Crystal coming down with the flu. Instead, Crystal, who was wearing Hannibal Lecter's mask from The Silence of the Lambs, was hauled onto the stage by two men. Several other people were involved in the production of the ceremony. Choreographer Debbie Allen supervised the Best Song nominee performances and the Best Original Score dance number. Film composer and musician Bill Conti served as musical director of the ceremony.

        "content": "Several days before the ceremony, LGBT activist groups such as Queer Nation and Out in Film announced plans to stage a protest outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. The organizations were voicing their complaints regarding derogatory and unflattering portrayals of homosexuals in film such as The Silence of the Lambs, JFK, and the upcoming film Basic Instinct. Queer Nation spokesman Rick Wilson said that the demonstrators \"would stop cars from getting to the Oscars. It'll be a stall-in\". Wilson also announced plans to disrupt the proceedings inside the theater. In response, producer Gil Cates stated, \"Anyone can protest about anything they want outside the show.\" But he said that the standard, \"generic response\" to something happening during the ceremony on camera, \"would be to cut to a commercial.\" Moreover, Academy spokesman Bob Werden reiterated that while security plans would not be as stringent as the previous year, firemen and police officers would be on hand in case of fallout from the protests. On the day of the telecast, several protesters carried various signs that contained statements such as \"Stop Hollywood's Homophobia\" and \"Hollywood Stop Censoring Our True Queer Lives.\" One man who had purchased tickets to the ceremony yelled statistics regarding AIDS in protest as John Candy was introducing a Best Song performance. The protester was immediately escorted out by security without any arrests, nor were his remarks heard during the broadcast."

After the girl revealed that she had been a victim of rape, Sandilands asked \"Right ... is that the only experience you\u2019ve had?\" Following this incident, a full-time censor was brought on board. Despite the suspension, Kyle and Jackie O maintained their number-one position in the market, and the show actually grew 0.6 percentage points. In September 2009, Sandilands apologised after making an on-air remark about how actor Magda Szubanski could lose a lot more weight if she had spent time in a concentration camp. Although Szubanski indicated that it was a \"beat up\" and that she \"couldn't care less,\" Sandilands was still suspended. In July 2011, Sandilands made headlines after stating that Australian model Megan Gale was a \"phony\" and that he \"never liked her\". Gale's management responded by cancelling Gale's upcoming interview on the show. Later that week, model Charlotte Dawson hit out at Sandilands on her Twitter account, saying that he could \"f*** off\". In August 2011, Sandilands faced criticism from the Indian community over comments he made on the show about the cleanliness of the Ganges River. The Universal Society of Hinduism later admitted that there was no malice behind Sandilands's comments and accepted his reasoning. In November 2011, Sandilands used his radio show to launch abuse at Daily Telegraph columnist Alison Henderson, for her negative review of the Kyle & Jackie O TV show (which had performed poorly in the ratings). Sandilands called Henderson a \"fat slag\" and a \"piece of shit\", accused the columnist of bias because \"she just hates us and has always hated us\", before making more derogatory comments about her body. The ACMA investigation into the show imposed further restrictions on 2DayFM, meaning that the radio station would be in breach if any broadcast made statements to demean women or girls. In May 2016, legal action was launched against Jackie O and the Australian Radio Network, after Jackie O questioned the parentage of NRL player Kieran Foran's son on air. Jackie O made the claim in late April, after it was revealed that Foran had checked into a mental health clinic, and had been granted indefinite leave from his club. Rugby league writer, Danny Weidler responded at the time \"The suggestion from Jackie O on Kiis1065 that Kieran Foran's baby boy is not his is false and offensive to all concerned\". The legal demand instructed the show to make a full retraction of the defamatory allegation against Foran and his ex-partner, and issue an unreserved apology."

        "title": "DZMM-AM_Radyo Patrol's first literation: the early years",
        "content": "It began on October 19, 1953, when DZAQ, the forerunner of DZMM was the first radio station of the former ABS (Alto Broadcasting System) of the Quirinos under President Elpidio Quirino's brother, Antonio (originally came from the pre-1953 experimental station DZBC), opened its doors as a radio station using the Filipino language in its broadcasts, following what DZBC had done before as the first-ever radio station in Manila using Filipino instead of the English language used by other stations at that time. DZAQ 620\u00a0kHz featured news, variety and music programs on an AM format which then the progenitor of DZAQ-TV 3. Eddie Ilarde, Ike Lozada, German Moreno and Joey de Leon were the personalities of the station at that time. Its first radio studios were in Manila, sharing the same building with the television studios. In 1957, with the opening of the then new ABS radio and television studios in Pasay, the DZAQ radio studios moved there. Years later, when ABS and the Lopez-owned Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN) were formally merged into a single network in 1967, DZAQ 620\u00a0kHz switched frequencies with CBN-owned DZXL 960\u00a0kHz and was later rebranded as DZAQ Radyo Patrol 960\u00a0kHz, one of the pre-martial law flagship AM stations of ABS-CBN until 1972. Orly Mercado, who was one of the station managers from 1969 to 1971, together with Ben Aniceto, came up with a vision to establish a 24-hour all-news and all-talk radio station and ABS-CBN conceptualized it under the Radyo Patrol brand \u2013 the de facto successor of the ephemeral 24 hour news station DZQL Radyo Reloj, which CBN launched in 1956 (the very year it launched), and the first-ever 24-hour news radio station in the country and in Southeast Asia. The first and original Radyo Patrol team was unceremoniously organized following the aftermath of Super Typhoon Welming (International name: Emma) in 1967, at the old ABS-CBN Radio Broadcast Center in Aduana Street, Intramuros, Manila, which housed the station since it was moved in 1958. The then program manager Ben Aniceto and Chief Engineer Emilio Solidum created a solution to broadcast typhoon damage news from Manila and the surrounding areas. Using two VW Combis attached with a UHF transmitter, two teams of reporters were dispatched. Combi One had Al Mendez and Zoilo Paragas Jr as reporters; and Combi 2 with Bar Samson. DZQL and DZXL became the carrying stations with then current DJs Naldy Castro, Buddy Medina, Boots Baker, Mary Jane Madamba and even the late Ike Lozada alternating as anchors. Cesar Mortega was assigned to coordinate the broadcasts. The broadcasts proved to be a huge success for the corporation, and for its news service. Then came the magnitude 7.6 earthquake in Casiguran (in which Manila was severely affected by that quake). This strong earthquake lead to the collapse of the Ruby Tower in the capital's downtown districts. This was the second major news event as a progenitor to the current Radyo Patrol; this time, DZAQ took on the gargantuan task of informing the nation live as it happened. The Radyo Patrol Ruby Tower project was then handled by former DZAQ station manager Orly Mercado, and veteran broadcaster Joe Taruc; the first reporters assigned as Radyo Patrol reporters were Mercado himself, Jun Ricafrente, Mario Garcia, Chris Daluz and Ismael Reyes. The marathon radio-TV simulcast of a major coverage \u2014 the first of its kind by a Philippine media firm, was a success, and the Radyo Patrol format later became an integral part of DZAQ's broadcasts, with the station's field reporters being assigned to cover breaking news stories and then calling the station to convey these stories as they happened. Encouraged by the success of the field reports of breaking news stories in the Greater Manila Area and beyond, DZAQ was later that year converted into a 24-hour uninterrupted news and commentary station by orders of the corporation management, covering many national events of great importance to listeners, as DZXL took over its entertainment and music programming. Based on a survey conducted by Seamark, Inc., DZXL was the most popular radio station in the country by mid-1970. At the same time, the original team of 5 field reporters was later expanded to include both young announcers, most notably Rey Langit (now with DZRJ-AM), Ernie Baron, and Manolo Favis (now with Radyo La Verdad 1350), and industry news veterans. By 1971, the success of the Radyo Patrol format in the Greater Manila Area had led to select ABS-CBN provincial radio stations establishing Radyo Patrol news services within their areas."

Two years after the forced shut down of all radio and television stations, DWWW (Radyo Broadcast City), a crony-owned AM station of Kanlaon Broadcasting System or KBS (now known as Radio Philippines Network or RPN) began to air in 1973 which contained news, public service programs, drama and music. Veteran anchors and new recruits like Johnny de Leon, Rod Navarro, Joe Taruc and Vic Morales came into DWWW at that time. Dely Magpayo, Henry Jones Ragas, Gel Santos-Relos and Noli de Castro were among those who worked as station announcers. Under the Marcos crony control, the station was dubbed Pinakamatatag sa Buong Pilipinas (The strongest in the Philippines). Following the switch from NARBA-implemented 10\u00a0kHz to GE75-implemented 9\u00a0kHz on November 23, 1978, DWWW's frequency was reassigned from 620 to 630 AM, and gained a new home in Broadcast City in Diliman, Quezon City. On the third day of the 1986 EDSA Revolution, reformist rebels stormed into the RPN broadcast complex and DWWW knocked off from the air following the capture of channel 4 on the morning of February 24, 1986, and Channel 9 the day after. At the end, both DWWW of RPN and DWOK of BBC were sequestered by the government with ABS-CBN getting both stations as a result."

After days of careful planning and a period of test broadcast which took place from July 16\u201321, 1986 (alongside DWKO-FM 101.9, which started broadcasting and the network's mother TV station ABS-CBN Channel 2, which re-opened on September 14), DZMM officially signed on the air with the new tagline \"Ang Himpilan ng Malayang Mamamayan\" (Station of the Independent People) on the afternoon of July 22, 1986, at 3 pm. Rene Jose (now with DWIZ and UNTV) delivered the first sign-on spiels, while Magpayo (who came from DWWW) was the first-ever anchor to grace the airwaves of the new station with her program Dear Tiya Dely (before she transferred to DZRH to continue her program until her death in September 2008), followed by other broadcast icons like Jun Ricafrente (who also became one of the original reporters of the pre-Martial Law Radyo Patrol era), Cesar Mortega, Ric Tierro and de Castro, newly recruited women Mel Tiangco (now with GMA Network) and Angelique Lazo (now with Radyo Veritas and PTV), as well as Ernie Baron and Kuya Cesar. Knowledge Power, the first-ever full-length program of the station was launched. It was also the country's first-ever scholastic program on AM radio. Mario Garcia, who was part of the original Radyo Patrol core and recruited from DWAN 1206, was the first station manager, months after its reopening. It was only in 1987 that the station was transferred to its current studios inside the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center in Quezon City from the former Chronicle Building in Ortigas Center, Pasig. During its first years of operations, DZMM operated from sign-on to sign-off on a 19-hour-a-day to 20-hour-a-day schedule during that time. In 1987, the first-ever tandem on local AM radio was introduced. Mel Tiangco and Jay Sonza were the hosts of Mel & Jay and immediately became a hit to the listeners and lasted for a couple of years. It was also in the same year when DZMM build a remarkable roster of radio talents, including Ted Failon (now with Radyo Singko 92.3 News FM), Korina Sanchez, Frankie Evangelista, Gel Santos-Relos, Ernie Angeles (who also served its station's voice over during its first decade of operations), Neil Ocampo (deceased) and Jake Maderazo (now with Radyo Inquirer 990). As it was in the past, DZMM held on the tradition of the stalwart ABS-CBN Radyo Patrol (field reporters) of the 1960s and early 1970s to further develop the station's capabilities in serving the public. Jun Ricafrente, Radyo Patrol #3 (later transferred to Vic de Leon-Lima, now with DWIZ), one of the original members of the team, started training new recruits. The first of the 2nd generation reporters to be selected were RP #2 Claude Vitug, RP #4 Emil Recometa, RP #1 Lito Villarosa and RP #5 Neil Ocampo. It was also in this year when military insurgents took over the station during the 1987 coup attempts. However, this did not stop DZMM from delivering news to the public, the booth was moved to then undisclosed location and immediately resumed broadcasting. In 1989, DZMM eventually evolved into a 24-hour round-the-clock broadcast service, in keeping up with the demands of delivering the news to the listeners. Failon, who is known for his distinct style of broadcasting, changed the landscape of Philippine radio broadcasting as he joined DZMM's roster of broadcasters the following year. And at the same time, he had a program with the station entitled Gising Pilipinas (originally known as Good Morning Pilipinas; unrelated to the now defunct morning show aired on PTV-4), formerly aired on weekdays from 2\u20134 am."

Because of the thousands of less-fortunate listeners flocking the station asking for assistance from the program, the executives decided to create DZMM Public Service Center, the first-ever separate office exclusively created for public service by a local AM station. However, Aksyon Ngayon aired its final broadcast on December 30, 2016, and was replaced by ABS-CBN Lingkod Kapamilya sa DZMM, hosted by Julius Babao and Bernadette Sembrano. On November 5, 1993, DZMM launched Pulis, Pulis Kung Umaksiyon, Mabilis. The program was first anchored by broadcast icons, Noli de Castro, Jay Sonza, and Mel Tiangco. It was created to keep the public informed on the activities of the Philippine National Police. It also became a venue for comments and grievances of the listening public on issues concerning the law enforcers. In 1996, DZMM became the first AM station in the Philippines to be made available in the World Wide Web with its inclusion in ABS-CBN website. All programs of the stations are broadcast live and can be enjoyed by Filipinos around the world via The Filipino Channel (TFC)."

By the end of 1999, DZMM moved its transmitting facilities from Libis, Caloocan since before martial law to the state-of-the-art 50,000-watt transmission equipment were moved to Obando, Bulacan. On September 14, 1998, ABS-CBN Sky Patrol, the first-ever news chopper in the country, was launched. Anchored by Ricky Velasco, Sky Patrol changed the way of delivering and gathering news. ABS-CBN Sky Patrol is the news chopper of DZMM, ABS-CBN and the ABS-CBN News Channel. As of 2016, the Sky Patrol has been rarely used by the network and its sister stations, as it was replaced by video drones on 2017."

On the same day, the ANC, as an emergency measure, temporary simulcasts DZMM programs to local and international viewers but with own commercials, cutting its feed for the flagship Top Story. On March 19, 2020, DZMM, formally stops temporary the replay broadcasts of ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs programming at 1:00\u00a0p.m. (which began Monday as a result of the decision for the temporary halt of broadcasts of Good Vibes) and replaces them with a news simulcast from the ABS-CBN News Channel, another unprecedended decision, thus DZMM becomes the first radio station in many years, since the end of English broadcasts on DZRJ in the 2010s, to air English language news programming on the AM brand and by extension DZMM TeleRadyo becomes a pioneer in airing bilingual (Filipino and English) news programming in both cable and digital FTA television. The English broadcasts air from 1:00\u00a0p.m. (following Headline Pilipinas) to 10:00\u00a0p.m., Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays, with ANC's relay of DZMM programs on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays (Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays starting at 8:00\u00a0a.m. to 10:00\u00a0p.m. following Early Edition), with a break at 9:00\u00a0a.m. for Market Edge during trading days in the Philippine Stock Exchange and 5:00\u00a0p.m. for Top Story.

The studio and facilities of DZMM have been vacated and will be immediately disinfected. Those who have not been exposed shall work from home. With this move, DZMM and DZMM TeleRadyo, as well as the provincial regional AM radio station, become English-only (for the first time in history after many years) as a provisional measure. From 5:30\u00a0p.m. to 10:00\u00a0p.m., the channel aired the best of ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs programming in their place with a 6:30\u00a0p.m. break for TV Patrol. On April 3, 2020, DZMM Radyo Patrol 630 and DZMM TeleRadyo resumes transmissions, with all programming are now aired via the Zoom platform; as DZMM TeleRadyo shares infrastructure, graphics, and commercials from ANC. On April 9\u201311, 2020, by virtue of a partnership between The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Philippines, given the effects of the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon and many other provinces, for the first time ever, the 190th General Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, aired from the Conference Center in Temple Square, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA was officially broadcast countrywide on both free-to-air and cable, not just to members of the Church, but also to non-members on DZMM TeleRadyo during the Easter Triduum period, making it the first time it had been ever done via satellite delay. All the broadcasts on DZMM TeleRadyo on the same days were also simulcast as well on the ABS-CBN News Channel. This event was the very first time it had aired on Philippine television. On April 13, 2020, commercial feeds for both ANC and DZMM TeleRadyo for Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays are now separated after days of using a singular commercial feed. In addition, DZMM and DZMM TeleRadyo now resume use of the radio studios following disinfection measures, with SRO: Suhestyon, Reaksyon at Opinion as the first broadcasts to be aired from there. On April 20, 2020, after 4 weeks, the timesharing of programming between both DZMM TeleRadyo and ANC ends, with ANC now resuming separate programming on Mondays and DZMM slowly resuming broadcasts from the radio studios, though some programs are still produced through Zoom. On the same day, Headline Pilipinas now extends its time slot on DZMM TeleRadyo, starting at 12:15\u00a0p.m. and ending at 2:00\u00a0p.m. to accommodate more national and local reports. However, the overnight simulcasts on MOR 101.9 (for radio) and ANC (for TeleRadyo) were retained and broadcast after Dr. Love Radio Show starting at 11:00pm. On May 5, 2020, the station together with its ABS-CBN, S+A, and MOR Philippines was ordered by the National Telecommunications Commission to sign off at 7:52\u00a0pm due to its expiration of its franchise the day before. At 8:20\u00a0pm, DZMM and its television counterpart went off the air following S.R.O.: Suhestyon, Reaksyon at Opinyon. On May 7, 2020, ABS-CBN, through its lawyers, filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) with the Supreme Court of the Philippines to stop the implementation of the NTC's cease-and-desist order and thus allow the DZMM and other ABS-CBN TV and radio stations to return to the airwaves whilst proceedings related to its franchise renewal are still ongoing. A decision on that motion is still pending."

The HBO miniseries Angels in America had the most successful night. It became the first program to sweep every major category, going 7/7, in Emmy history, until 2020 when Schitt\u2019s Creek repeated the feat. Along with Schitt\u2019s Creek, Caesar's Hour in 1957 and The Crown in 2021, it is one of only four programs to win all four main acting categories. Upstart comedy series Arrested Development won Outstanding Comedy Series (being the second time Fox won that specific award) and three other major awards overall.  Its pilot became the twelfth episode to accomplish the directing/writing double. After years of winning everything but the top prize, The Sopranos finally took home the crown for Outstanding Drama Series, not only knocking off four-time defending champion The West Wing but by being the first cable show, HBO, ever to beat any of the Big Four television networks for that award.  It led all dramas with twelve major nominations and four major wins. One of those wins was for Drea de Matteo for Drama Supporting Actress and, too, was the first time that award went to a cable network.  Furthermore, the cable network also won for the first times in the Comedy Lead Actress and Comedy Supporting Actress categories (Sarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon respectively for Sex and the City). Entering its final ceremony, five-time series champion Frasier needed five major wins to tie The Mary Tyler Moore Shows record of 27 major wins. Because it was only nominated in five major categories, breaking the record was not possible. Though it did not tie the record, Frasier finished its Emmy career on a high note, winning three major awards, the most it had won since 1998. Its 25 major wins put it at second of all time. When adding its wins in technical categories, its total rises to 37, the most for any comedy series."

It was founded by Michael Greene and Producers & Songwriters Rudy P\u00e9rez & Mauricio Abaroa. Rudy P\u00e9rez was the Grammy Florida chapter's first President of the Board. The concept of a separate Grammy Awards for Latin music began in 1989. According to organizers, the Latin Grammy Awards was established as the Latin music universe was deemed too large to fit on the Grammy Awards. The Latin Recording Academy defines Latin music as music in Spanish or Portuguese. The Latin Grammy Awards mainly encompasses music released in Latin America, Spain, Portugal and the United States. In 2000, it was announced that the 1st Annual Latin Grammy Awards would take place at the Staples Center on September 13, 2000. On July 7, 2000, the nominations were announced in Miami, Florida, United States. The Latin Grammys were introduced with over 39 categories included limited to Spanish and Portuguese-speaking recordings. The first telecast took place at the Staples Center and was broadcast. The following year's show was canceled due to the September 11, 2001 attacks, which was the same day the show was to take place. In 2002, the academy elected its first independent Board of Trustees. In 2005, the broadcast was moved from CBS to Univision where the whole telecast was in Spanish. Voting members live in various regions in the US and outside of the US including Latin America and Iberia. For a recording to be eligible for a nomination, it must have at least 51% of its content recorded in Spanish or Portuguese and commercially released in North America, Central America, South America, the Caribbean, Spain, or Portugal. Products recorded in languages and dialects from Ibero-America such as Catalan, Basque, Galician, Valencian, Nahuatl, Guarani, Quechua or Mayan may be accepted by majority vote of the committees of the Latin Recording Academy. The Latin Recording Academy also accepts Latin instrumental music from Ibero-America as well as compositions that have been composed or interpreted by an Iberian American musician. The eligibility period is June 1 to May 30 for a respective awards ceremony. Recordings are first entered and then reviewed to determine the awards they are eligible for. Following that, nominating ballots are mailed to voting members of the academy. The votes are tabulated and the five recordings in each category with the most votes become the nominees. Final voting ballots are sent out to voting members and the winners are determined. Winners are later announced at the Latin Grammy Awards. The current President & CEO of the Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences is Manuel Abud, who succeeded Gabriel Abaroa in 2021. Altogether there are three events: the Life Achievement when renowned artists are honored for lifetime achievement; Person of the Year, when one artist is honored at a gala dinner, and Grammy itself, an award that brings together artists from all over Latin America and Iberia and that today is broadcast live to 80 countries, including Brazil, by channel Univision (TNT in Brazil)."

Upon the announcement of the Latin Grammy Awards in 1999, several musical journalists raised concerns about the awards being used as a marketing tool by the mainstream media. Manny S. Gonzalez of the Vista En L.A felt that the award would just be used to advertise artists being promoted by Emilio Estefan. The lack of categories for non Spanish and Portuguese-speaking music has been criticized, namely by artists who consider their work to be \"Latin\" but are not eligible for a Latin Grammy including those from Haiti (who have compared their compas music to merengue music from the Dominican Republic but is sung in French Creole) and Celtic musicians from the Galicia and Asturias regions of Spain. The linguistic requirement has also been criticized by Tony Succar whose album, Unity: The Latin Tribute to Michael Jackson, was not eligible for a Latin Grammy Award despite the album being recorded in salsa music. In response to the criticism, a spokesman for the Latin Recording Academy stated: \"The Latin Recording Academy considers music based on the contents of the recording itself -- the technical elements that go into the art of music making -- not based on how a recording or an artist is marketed externally.\" In 2001, Cuban exiles living in Miami protested at the Latin Grammy Awards for allowing musicians living in Cuba to perform at the stage. This resulted in the Latin Grammys being moved to Los Angeles for the second annual awards (which would in the end be canceled in the aftermath of the  September 11 attacks). In October 2010, a year in which he did not have any new works eligible for the 11th Annual Latin Grammy Awards, Venezuelan singer-songwriter Franco De Vitaa previous nomineecalled the Latin Grammys \"fake and a lie\" and stated that if he were to ever win an award, he would not accept it. The following year, he won his first two Latin Grammy Awards, at the 12th Annual Latin Grammy Awards. American musician Willie Col\u00f3n observed the relationship between the Latin Grammys and major Latin record labels. Mexican singer-songwriter Aleks Syntek noted that Mexican artists in general were apathetic towards the awards. The Latin Grammys was met with backlash at the 2019 awards ceremony when none of the urbano artists were nominated in the general categories despite its popularity. This led to several reggaeton artists, including Daddy Yankee and J Balvin, boycotting the event. The Latin Recording Academy responded to criticism by requesting the \"leaders of the urban community to get involved with the Academy, to get involved with the process, and to get involved with discussions that improve the Academy.\""

The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Gil Cates and directed by Louis J. Horvitz. Actor Jon Stewart hosted the show for the first time. Two weeks earlier in a ceremony at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California held on February 18, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by host Rachel McAdams. Crash won three awards, including Best Picture. Other winners included Brokeback Mountain, King Kong, and Memoirs of a Geisha with three awards and Capote, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, The Constant Gardener, Hustle & Flow, March of the Penguins, The Moon and the Son: An Imagined Conversation, A Note of Triumph: The Golden Age of Norman Corwin, Six Shooter, Syriana, Tsotsi, Walk the Line, and Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit with one.

Brokeback Mountain earned the most nominations with eight total; Crash, Good Night, and Good Luck, and Memoirs of a Geisha tied for second with six nominations each. All five Best Picture nominees received corresponding Best Director nominations (the fourth occurrence in Oscar history since the Best Picture nominees roster was limited to five films). The winners were announced during the awards ceremony on March 5, 2006. Several notable achievements by multiple individuals and films occurred during the ceremony. Crash was the first Best Picture winner since 1976's Rocky to win only three Oscars. Best Director winner Ang Lee became the first non-Caucasian winner of that category. For this first time since the 34th ceremony held in 1962, all four acting winners were first-time nominees. At age 20, Keira Knightley was the second-youngest Best Actress nominee for her performance as Elizabeth Bennet in Pride & Prejudice. Best Supporting Actor winner George Clooney was the fifth person to receive acting, directing, and screenwriting nominations in the same year and the first person to achieve this feat for two different films. By virtue of his nominations for both Memoirs of a Geisha and Munich, composer John Williams earned a total of 45 nominations tying him with Alfred Newman as the second most nominated individual in Oscar history. \"It's Hard out Here for a Pimp\" became the second rap song to win Best Original Song and the first such song to be performed at an Oscars ceremony."

However, in an article published in The New York Times, it was stated that 2005 host Chris Rock would not return to host the show. According to a statement released by his publicist, \"He didn't want to do it in perpetuity, He'd like to do it again down the road.\" Furthermore, many media outlets speculated that several AMPAS members felt uncomfortable with Rock's disparaging comments about Colin Farrell, Jude Law, and Tobey Maguire. Initially, Cates sought actor and veteran Oscar host Billy Crystal to host the ceremony again. However, Crystal declined the offer citing his commitment to his one-man comedy show 700 Sundays. In January 2006, Cates announced that actor, comedian, and talk show host Jon Stewart, who had previously hosted two consecutive Grammy Awards ceremonies in 2001 and 2002, was chosen as host of the 2006 telecast. Cates explained the decision to hire him saying, \"My wife and I watch him every night. Jon is the epitome of a perfect host \u2014 smart, engaging, irreverent and funny.\" In a statement, Stewart expressed that he was honored to be selected to emcee the program, jokingly adding, \"Although, as an avid watcher of the Oscars, I can't help but be a little disappointed with the choice. It appears to be another sad attempt to smoke out Billy Crystal.\" Several other people and companies participated in the production of the ceremony. Bill Conti served as musical supervisor for the telecast. Media firm The Ant Farm produced a thirty-second trailer promoting the broadcast featuring clips highlighting past Oscar winners to the tune of the song \"Our Lives\" by The Calling. Previous Oscar hosts such as Whoopi Goldberg and Steve Martin, and actors Mel Gibson, George Clooney, Halle Berry appeared in an opening comedic sketch. Actor Tom Hanks participated in a pre-taped comedic sketch lampooning Oscar speeches. Stephen Colbert (host of The Colbert Report, the sister program of Stewart's The Daily Show) narrated two different mock attack ads lampooning both the intense campaigning and lobbying during Oscar season put forth by film studios and political advertising during elections. Violinist Itzhak Perlman performed excerpts from the five nominees for Best Original Score."

Television critic Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that Stewart was more \"amusing than funny\". He added, \"Many of his jokes fell flat with the stars in the Kodak Theatre, and his tendency to bow down before celebrities quickly grew tiresome.\" Tom Shales from The Washington Post commented, \"It's hard to believe that professional entertainers could have put together a show less entertaining than this year's Oscars, hosted with a smug humorlessness by comic Jon Stewart, a sad and pale shadow of great hosts gone by.\" Moreover, he derided the \"piles and piles and miles and miles of clips from films present and past\" writing that it \"squandered the visual luster\" of the ceremony. Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore remarked, \"Stewart, usually a very funny guy, displayed a lack of beginner's luck as first-time host...His usually impeccable blend of puckishness and self-effacement fell flat in the service of Oscar.\" He also criticized the decision to play music over the winner's acceptance speeches calling it \"distracting and obnoxious.\""

The Academy sought ideas to revamp the show while renewing interest with the nominated films. In September 2006, the Academy selected producer Laura Ziskin to oversee production of the telecast for a second time. Nearly three months later, actress and comedian Ellen DeGeneres, who had previously emceed three Primetime Emmy Award ceremonies between 2001 and 2005, was chosen as host of the 2007 ceremony. In an article published in the Los Angeles Times, Ziskin explained the decision to hire DeGeneres saying \"Certainly, I believe the presence of Ellen will help the ratings absolutely. She's popular with a very wide audience. She is not a niche performer. She touches a lot of demographics.\" AMPAS christened this year's telecast with a theme celebrating movie quotes. In tandem with the theme, advertising agency TBWA\\Chiat\\Day designed the official ceremony poster featuring 75 quotes from several Oscar-nominated or winning films. To stir interest surrounding the awards, filmmaker Spike Lee released a trailer featuring everyday people around New York City reciting famous film lines. During the ceremony, a montage produced by director Nancy Meyers saluted the work of screenwriters and their contributions to film. During the telecast, former U.S. Vice President and environmental activist Al Gore, and Best Actor nominee Leonardo DiCaprio announced that AMPAS would incorporate several environmentally and ecologically conscious features into the ceremony. Designed by Frank Webb and Matthew White, the Architectural Digest greenroom where presenters and winners mingled backstage featured several environmentally friendly features such as a rug made of recycled plastic bottles and walls painted without any volatile organic compounds. Other eco-friendly features included the transportation for guests of the awards via hybrid electric vehicles, usage of recyclable paper for ballots and invitations, and serving meals at the Governor's Ball on reusable plates and biodegradable dishware. Several other people participated in the production of the ceremony. William Ross served as musical director for the ceremony. J. Michael Riva designed a new set and stage design for the ceremony. Voice actor Don LaFontaine was hired with Gina Tuttle as announcers for the telecast. Actor Greg Vaughan and Lucky columnist Allyson Waterman co-hosted \"Road to the Oscars\", a weekly behind-the-scenes video blog on the Oscar ceremony website. Members of the dance troupe and contortionist group Pilobolus performed interpretive shadow figures representing scenes and logos from the nominated films. Actors Jack Black, Will Ferrell, and John C. Reilly performed a lighthearted musical number written by comedic director Judd Apatow and music composer Marc Shaiman satirizing comedy's lack of recognition at the Academy Awards. Conducted by musician Steve Sidwell, the Sound Effects Choir performed voice effects to a montage of classic films. Another vignette directed by documentary filmmaker Errol Morris featuring several Oscar nominees discussing what it means to be an Oscar nominee was shown at the beginning of the show. Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore assembled a tribute highlighting previous winners of the Best Foreign Language Film. Filmmaker Michael Mann produced a montage highlighting American life through the eyes of cinema."

        "content": "The show received a mixed reception from media publications. Some media outlets were more critical of the show. Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle lamented, \"It was long. It was flat. And it was bloated. Worst of all, it was boring.\" He also wrote that \"it was difficult for Ellen's subtle rambling to translate because people want pop and humor and declarative sentences in their Academy Awards. Which they didn't exactly get.\" The Denver Post television critic Joanne Ostrow bemoaned, \"Pleasant and innocuous but hardly exciting, DeGeneres forgot the primary Academy Award host directive: It's not about the host. Hollywood's biggest night (and television's second-biggest annual gathering, after the Super Bowl) is a celebration of film.\" The Washington Post columnist Tom Shales gave an average review for DeGeneres but criticized the overall slow and choppy pacing of the program noting that it was \"punishingly too long.\" Other media outlets received the broadcast more positively. Columnist Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times lauded DeGeneres's performance writing that she was \"cheeky but good-natured, far less barbed and sardonic than Jon Stewart last year or Chris Rock in 2005.\" She added that her style brought a \"casual Friday mood to Fancy Sunday.\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch television critic Gail Pennington praised host DeGeneres and producer Ziskin for turning \"the evening into an upbeat celebration\u2013\u2013and the most entertaining Oscars in years.\" Television editor Dave Kronke of the Los Angeles Daily News gave high marks for DeGeneres commenting, \"Her material was amusing but scarcely a laugh riot, yet it was amiable and delineated that the evening was a celebration of all the nominees, not just the winners.\""

The Awards presentation, hosting duties were handled by 34 \"Friends of Oscar\" and broadcast by NBC for the first time in 11 years. It was during this ceremony that George C. Scott became the first actor to reject an Oscar, claiming that the Academy Awards were \"a two-hour meat parade, a public display with contrived suspense for economic reasons.\" With her Best Supporting Actress win, Helen Hayes became the first performer to win Oscars in both lead and supporting categories (having won Best Actress 38 years before for The Sin of Madelon Claudet). She also has the record of having the biggest gap between acting wins. The documentary film Woodstock garnered three Oscar nominations, making it the most nominated documentary film in Oscar history. This was the only time since the 6th Academy Awards that all five nominees for Best Actress were first-time nominees, and was the last time to date that either lead acting category was entirely composed of new nominees. Also, this was the first time since the 7th Academy Awards in which none of the nominees for the Best Actor had a previous nomination in that category."

The ceremonies were presided over by Walter Matthau, Robert Shaw, George Segal, Goldie Hawn, and Gene Kelly. This year, ABC took over broadcast rights from NBC and continues to broadcast them today. The recent previous editions had been held on Tuesday night. (NBC's coverage of the NCAA championship basketball game aired opposite the ceremony; during the presentation of the Best Film Editing award, the winner was jokingly announced (by presenter Elliott Gould) as \"Indiana, 86\u201368\"; the undefeated Indiana Hoosiers had won the NCAA title that night in Philadelphia. The following year, the two events were again on the same night.) Milo\u0161 Forman's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest made a \"clean sweep\" of the major categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Screenplay (Adapted). It was the second of three films to date to accomplish the sweep, following It Happened One Night in 1934 and preceding The Silence of the Lambs in 1991. French actress Isabelle Adjani received her first nomination for Best Actress this year, making Adjani, 20 at the time, the youngest actress to be nominated in the leading actress category, breaking the record set by 22-year-old Elizabeth Hartman in 1965. This record would later be surpassed by 13-year-old Keisha Castle-Hughes in 2004, and again in 2013 by nine-year old Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis. Adjani also presented the Best Film Editing award that night along with Gould who delivered the Indiana joke during the presentation. At age 80, George Burns became the oldest acting and Best Supporting Actor awardee (as well as the final person born in the nineteenth century to receive an acting award), a record that stood until Jessica Tandy won Best Actress in 1989. Burns was later succeeded by Christopher Plummer, who won Best Supporting Actor in 2012 for Beginners at the age of 82, as the oldest male acting winner. Jaws was followed 25 years later by Traffic as a film that won all its nominations except Best Picture. As of the 92nd Academy Awards, Amarcord, nominated for Best Director, is the last film to be nominated for Academy Awards in two separate years (having won the award for Best Foreign Language Film the year before)."

He first presided over the 51st ceremony held in 1979, and had last hosted the 54th ceremony held in 1982. Nine days earlier, in a ceremony held at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, on March 31, the Academy Scientific and Technical Awards were presented by hosts Joan Collins and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Terms of Endearment won five awards, including Best Picture.

Allen explained the decision to hire Carson saying, \"In past years, Johnny has been a vital element in the ever-increasing success and popularity of the Oscar presentations. We are extremely pleased that we will be able to draw once again on his wit and charisma to host this special entertainment event.\" Several other people were involved with the production of the ceremony. Musician Quincy Jones served as musical director for the ceremony where he conducted an overture performed by the orchestra at the beginning of the show. Former child actress Shirley Temple made a special appearance at the beginning of the telecast to discuss her memories of the 7th ceremony in 1935 where she received the Academy Juvenile Award. Singers Sammy Davis Jr. and Liza Minnelli performed \"There's No Business Like Show Business\" at the conclusion of the telecast. Marty Pasetta served as director for the telecast.

This was not one of your more electrifying Academy Awards telecasts. The three hours and 40 minutes passed as swiftly as Barry Lyndon.\" He also said, \"And the tradition of squeezing nearly all of the major, most glamorous awards into the last half hour again proved mistake, ill conceived, and just plain dumb.\" Other media outlets received the broadcast more positively. Television columnist John J. O'Connor of The New York Times wrote, \"The tone of the proceedings was set and maintained by a spiritedly genial Mr. Carson.\" He also added that Carson was able to \"provide with eternally boyish grace his typical comedy mix.\" The Baltimore Sun film critic Stephen Hunter quipped, \"The show, one of the crispest and most swiftly-paced in recent years, enjoyed its greatest asset in the return of Johnny Carson to the role of master of ceremonies. Mr. Carson was in top form.\" Mike Duffy of the Detroit Free Press wrote, \"Johnny Carson, once again the invaluable host, added some much needed spice with well-timed zingers. And I especially enjoyed Jack Nicholson's impersonation of a Blues Brother behind those black be-bopper shades.\""

        "content": "The lead character was Peter Christopher, a bachelor who enjoyed the single life, but was blocked from professional advancement by not having a wife. Peter's boss, baby-food manufacturer Max Brahms, was, because of his product, a strong believer in marriage and family. Christopher asked a young hat check girl, Greta Patterson, to pose as his wife at company functions. In return, Peter set up Greta in an apartment two floors above his own in a Manhattan building. Greta would use the fire escape to slip into Peter's 7th floor apartment from her apartment on the 9th floor whenever his boss would drop by unexpectedly.  As a silent running gag, Bryan O'Byrne played the \"Man in the middle\" who bemusedly watched the comings and goings of the two from his 8th floor vantage point. The sitcom's uncredited narrator was the well-known sports announcer Vin Scully. The series first experienced good ratings, tying at #18 with The Man from U.N.C.L.E. in the Nielsen ratings. The series then fell to #64 in the ratings after having to compete against ABC's popular series The Invaders and the CBS staple The Red Skelton Show. Occasional Wife was canceled after one season. The series was also notable for being one of the first sitcoms to eliminate the use of the laugh track, which set the series apart from other sitcoms on at the time. Its practice of not using canned laughter has now become an industry standard with most modern day single camera sitcoms. It is also noteworthy that in 1967 the lead actor, Michael Callan, divorced his wife and married Patricia Harty, his costar on this series."

The ceremony was rescheduled twice from its original date of September 16 at the Shrine Auditorium because of the September 11, 2001 attacks that occurred five days prior to the event. It was also removed from its rescheduled date of October 7 again at the same venue as a result of the start of the War in Afghanistan. The event was then relocated to the smaller Shubert Theater, which had previously hosted the 1973 and 1976 ceremonies, and would be demolished in 2002. The ceremony was hosted by Ellen DeGeneres and was broadcast on CBS. Barbra Streisand sang \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" in a surprise appearance at the close, in honor of the victims of the attacks. Sex and the City became the first premium channel show to win Outstanding Comedy Series; this was its only major award. The NBC cult hit Freaks and Geeks accomplished a rare feat: though it only ran for one season, it was nominated in two different years for writing. Frasier, now in its eighth season, earned its final Outstanding Comedy Series nomination after eight consecutive nominations including five consecutive wins (seasons 1\u20135). The episode \"Bowling\" made Malcolm in the Middle just the second show, and first comedy, to have two different episodes win awards for directing and writing. The Defenders was the first show to do this in 1963 and 1965. (Specific episodes were not nominated in the comedy categories until the late 1960s). Game of Thrones would also achieve this in 2015 and 2016. For his portrayal of John Cage in Ally McBeal, Peter MacNicol won Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series, the first in this category for Fox and the first in this category for any show outside the Big Three television networks. In the drama field, The West Wing won Outstanding Drama Series for its second straight year and led all shows with four major awards on the night. The Sopranos led all shows with 14 major nominations and was second to The West Wing with three major wins. Mike Nichols' win made him the ninth person to become an EGOT winner."

The award is organized by the Recording Industry Association of Malaysia (RIM) and was first held on 15 December 1993. It is Malaysia's equivalent of the Grammy awards. The award is not only focused on Malay-language music produced in Malaysia, but also English, Chinese, and Indian-language music. Separate awards were introduced for the latter two language music subcategories in 1999 and 2013 respectively. One of these, known as the AIM Chinese Music Awards, was held in 1999 and 2001 before encountering a twelve-year hiatus due to insufficient funds.) The broadcaster of the award has been changed several times, varying between RTM, Media Prima, and Astro. Since its introduction, the award has been held every year, with the exception of 1994 and 2015, due to changes in the month of the ceremony. The 2016-2018 edition of AIM was not held due to financial constraints."

Genre-specific best albums were introduced in 1995 and abolished in 2010 due to a declining number of albums released. The focus on Best Vocal Performance was changed from album to single in 2009. A Best Indonesian Album category was introduced in 1997, and was replaced by Best Malay Song Performed by a Foreign Artist in 2008 until 2013/2014. RIM has since added five new categories that recognize achievements by songs and music videos based on digital sales on all digital platforms. These new awards recognize significant contributions by record labels in the local music industry and provide opportunities to the public to be the jury through a new category, Best Malaysian Singer."

The show again moved to Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre in 2002 due to the impending closure of Wembley Arena for reconstruction, where it is now held every October. The event has become larger and more complex each year in its larger venue, including the introduction in 2003 of an extensive Equestrian Retail Village. Its purpose was to be a 'champion of champions' Show, and originally took the best from showing and show jumping competitions throughout the year. Nowadays HOYS allocates showing qualifiers to Societies and Shows and the Champions of these qualifiers compete at HOYS to be crowned the Champion of Champions. British Showjumping allocates the National Showjumping qualifiers  Over 120 county and equestrian shows in Great Britain host qualifiers for this huge indoor event. It is difficult to qualify and difficult to win. Due in part to its high standards of competition and its placement at the end of equestrian year, the Show has become a national treasure in the UK rich in heritage and tradition and is considered to be the most famous horse show in the world The show runs every October and incorporates a full programme of international show jumping, the British National Show Jumping finals, Showing Finals and a range of displays and entertainment including the Pony Club Mounted Games for the Prince Philip Cup. In 1997 the then promoters of HOYS went bankrupt.  Grandstand Media Ltd were based at Wembley and with help from the shows existing supporters, officials and sponsors the show went on that year under Grandstand Media Ltd.  Following the 1997 show, Grandstand Media obtained a long license from British Showjumping to run the show in its entirety  and they have since revitalised the presentation and content including a special celebration in 1998 to commemorate the fiftieth show. Horse of the Year Show remains a National Institution, the finale to the showing year and the climax to the domestic show jumping year 2002 saw HOYS move from Wembley Arena, its home for over 40 years to the NEC Arena, Birmingham. Logistically this was very complicated as the show takes up over  of the NEC complex, but with record attendance figures and outstanding competition it was described by Horse & Hound as a 'Triumph' and was heralded a resounding success with sell out performances throughout the show. Since the move to the NEC HOYS has developed and expanded experiencing record numbers visit the Show every year Each year, the Sunday Gala Night concludes with Ronald Duncan's emotive poem The Horse; this was read by Simon MacCorkindale until 2010. Monty Roberts has described the Horse of the Year Show as the \"Best in the world. It is the \"World's Most Famous Horse Show\". The event was for many years televised by the BBC, where it attracted large audiences, but in recent years has been shown on Sky Sports.  By 2016, it had moved to Horse & Country TV."

        "content": "Qui veut gagner des millions ? (Who Wants to Win Millions?) is the French version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, which originated in Great Britain on the ITV network. The aim of the game is to win the top prize of \u20ac1,000,000 (3 for some shows then 4 million FF before France adopted the euro) by answering 12 (formerly 15) multiple-choice questions correctly. It is broadcast on the TF1 network, and was hosted by Jean-Pierre Foucault from 2000 until 2019, then by Camille Combal. For more about the show and rules see Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?; the money tree differs in amounts, but the format is virtually identical. For several years a \"Switch the Question\" lifeline was available once a contestant answered the fifth question correctly (note, in India, in Kaun Banega Crorepati this applies from the tenth). As of April 2009, the first three possible questions were taken out of the game, reducing the number of possible questions to 12, similar to the UK format in play from September 2007 to February 2014. For list of international variants of the show, see International versions of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. The show served as a plot device in the French film My Best Friend. In December 2010, TF1 announced the end of the first daily multi-year run, due to a fall in viewing of that series as of June. A prime-time version with celebrities (for charity) was maintained between 2010 and final broadcast of that main series on January 1, 2016. In December 2018 in a charity version, Jean-Pierre Foucault announced he would leave the show in favour of Camille Combal for a return to the air on TF1 in January 2019 \u2013 each figured respectively as a contestant on those shows also. In February 2019, TF1 announced the return of the daily version. The first tapings were scheduled for April 2019, for a broadcast from May 13, 2019, at 6:15 pm."

Phone-a-friends often express their certainty as a percentage (I am 80% sure it's C). Ask the Audience (L'avis du public): The contestant asks the studio audience which answer they believe is correct. Members of the studio audience indicate their choices using an audience response system. The results are immediately displayed on the contestant's and host's screens. This is a popular lifeline, known for its high accuracy. Ask the Host (Le feeling de Camille): Used in the 20th anniversary of the British original, the French revival, and the Italian revival. When used by the contestant, the host uses their knowledge of a question's subject, gives their thoughts about the question, and tries to assist them with finding the correct answer out of the choices given. The lifeline features no time limit, and the host reassures all they have no connection to the outside world and receive the question and possible answers for it at the same time as the contestant, and thus have no knowledge of what the correct answer is."

Prime Time, where celebrities aimed to win for their chosen charity, was broadcast between September 29, 2001 and January 1, 2016 and now January 19, 2019. Only the prime-time version with celebrities aired between 2010 and the first day of 2016, the daily version having stopped. On July 1, 2003, a special program entitled \"L'\u00e9mission interdite\" was broadcast in the second half of the evening. It was entirely devoted to the case Charles Ingram, contestant of the British version of the game who had pocketed \u00a3 1 million by cheating with the help of two accomplices present in the public and on the set. This report was the only time Jean-Pierre Foucault presented without the public. On September 5, 2015, TF1 broadcast a special anniversary edition (for the 15 years of the show). This saw TV game hosts from TF1 with their biggest winner (including Laurence Boccolini for Money Drop and Jean-Luc Reichmann for Les 12 coups de midi), as well as Christophe Beaugrand and Olivier Minne, as respective hosts of QI: la France passe le test and Joker; Foucault also played alongside a former grand prize winner. On January 1, 2016, TF1 broadcast a Pi\u00e8ces Jaunes special edition. On January 19, 2019, the return of the game after three years of absence, saw Jean-Pierre Foucault present the game for his last time hosting five pairs of celebrities playing for charities, emulating the latest series. At the end of the show, Camille Combal was a candidate (with Anne-\u00c9lisabeth Lemoine); Combal took over the reins of the show permanently (and next charity broadcast) on January 26; Foucault co-contested. On April 18, 2019, after the fire at Notre-Dame de Paris, TF1 announced that the Section de recherches series had been replaced by a special edition for that cathedral. This saw three pairs of presenters and a duo from Dance avec les stars : Anne-Claire Coudray and Harry Roselmack, Laurence Boccolini and Arthur, Alexandra Sublet and Gr\u00e9goire Margotton and Fauve Hautot and Chris Marques. The return of the daily version on May 13, 2019 brought a novelty: during some programs, two contestants participate in the duet game and two celebrities participate in the duet game for an association, which was previously the case only in the programs in the first part of the evening. On April 20, 2020, a format called \"\u00e0 la maison\" (at home) started broadcasting during the COVID-19 pandemic in France for celebrity contestants to answer questions from their homes using video conference. All prizes generated in this special program are given to charity."

They decide to visit it for its grand opening, but discover Doobner is actually Sideshow Bob, having left Italy alongside his wife, Francesca, and son, Gino, and created the restaurant and the commercial to lure the Simpsons into a trap. After tying up the Simpsons, Bob then reveals a large stack of crates filled with dynamite, with which he will kill them, using a laptop with a defective battery (which will overheat and explode) as a detonator. While gloating, Bob incorrectly quotes a phrase from Macbeth and Lisa corrects him. Bob tries to look up the correct phrase on Wikipedia, but the laptop explodes in Bob's hands, and he is then arrested and taken to court. During Bob's trial, Bob's father, Doctor Robert Terwilliger Sr., is brought to testify. He explains Bob has a rare heart condition and also suggests that Bob is insane because of his long-standing feud with Bart. Since all of the audience have been tormented by Bart's pranks, Bob convinces Springfield Bart is ultimately to blame and they all turn on him. As Bart pleads his innocence, Bob takes out a vial labeled nitroglycerin, which everyone thinks is a deadly explosive. However, as Bart throws the vial away to save everyone; it is shown to actually be Bob's heart medication and he collapses to the floor and is pronounced dead. Bob's entire family attends the funeral: His mother, Dame Judith Underdunk, a well-known Shakespearean actress; his father; his brother Cecil, who has been let out of prison for the occasion; and Francesca and Gino. Many regular Springfieldians also attend the funeral. Feeling slightly guilty, Bart speaks to Cecil, who reveals that Bob breaked him out of prison as a peace offering for his betrayal in \"Brother from Another Series\" before Wes Doobner's World Famous Family Style Rib Huts is made and gave him the job to supervise his Wes Doobner plan. Bart decides to go to the funeral home to make peace with Bob before he is cremated; however, Bob rises out of the coffin, alive and well, and traps Bart in it to be incinerated. Meanwhile, Milhouse inadvertently makes Lisa realizes that everything was an elaborate plot put together by Bob and his family: with his mother being a Shakespearean actress, Bob would have known Shakespeare too well to have accidentally misquoted him and figures that he must have done so intentionally in order to get caught and go to trial, where his father used a special drug to put him in a death-like state. Cecil helped by playing to Bart's guilty conscience and encouraging him to visit Bob, luring Bart into Bob's clutches once again. The Simpsons race to the funeral home and just barely manage to save Bart in time as the police then arrive and arrest Bob and his family. Defeated but curious, Bob questions Lisa on how she was able to figure out his plot \u2014 Lisa admits that she actually started getting suspicious when she noticed that Bob's coffin had been custom-made to fit his feet and points out that his family likely would not have bothered paying for something like that if he was actually dead. Bob and his family are then incarcerated with the former's cellmate, Snake Jailbird, who constantly torments them while Bob actually goes insane over killing the Simpsons as he imagines it."

        "content": "The scene where Homer blocks Marge from getting Bart out of the coffin, telling her, \"He has got to get over his fear of coffins,\" is derived from the opening scene from \"Tennis the Menace\" where Bart gets trapped in a coffin and starts to panic. Homer watches him panic on a closed circuit TV. The joke was written for The Simpsons Movie, in a scene that was cut from the final release of the movie, and re-used here. John Mahoney is the third Frasier cast member to play a member of the Terwilliger family, after Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce, his on-screen sons in both shows. The song Krusty sings at Bob's \"funeral\" is a take-off on \"Candle in the Wind\" by Elton John.  The title of the episode is also an allusion to the Elton John song \"Funeral for a Friend (Love Lies Bleeding)\", the preceding song to \"Candle in the Wind\" on the album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. The Terwilligers seal Bart in Bob's spacious coffin and turn on the conveyor belt to the cremation furnace in an attempt to incinerate him, in reference to Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd doing the same to James Bond in the film adaptation of Diamonds Are Forever."

Even with a return to what we know, this is still one of the weakest Sideshow Bob episodes. One major aspect of this episode is that it reunited the Crane family from Frasier. [...] While this could have been comedy gold, The Simpsons wasted the opportunity. Instead of keeping the familiar dynamics these actors had shared before (a tactic that worked extremely well in Cecil's first appearance), the series took a different route, making Mahoney's father character just as uppity and snobbish as his animated sons. Add an excessively elaborate, unfunny plot to kill Bart and \u2018Funeral for a Fiend\u2019 failed to capture any of the early seasons' Sideshow Bob magic.\" Richard Keller of AOL TV said, \"While Pierce and Mahoney did have their moments it was all Grammer this episode as a Sideshow Bob coming apart at the seams.\" He went on to say, \"For the most part this week's episode was entertaining. Plus, it also brought a bit of continuity into the show, something that comes and goes on the program.\" Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, praising the appearance of Pierce and Mahoney as Cecil and Dr. Terwilliger post-Fraiser, but criticized the TiVo storyline at the beginning, and wondered \"if Lisa's recap of Sideshow Bob's plot was meant to be an homage to \"Black Widower,\" when Bart recapped Bob's plan to kill Selma. If it was, it was half-assed; if it wasn't, it was a pleasant bit of unintentional nostalgia.\""

Most episodes feature stories of people who have been arrested while travelling abroad, usually for trying to smuggle illegal drugs, although some episodes feature people who were either kidnapped or captured while they were either travelling or living in other countries. Some episodes have featured real-life stories that first became well known when they were made the subject of a film: films that have been 're-made' in this way include Midnight Express, Goodfellas, The Devil's Double, Argo, Mr Nice and, to a lesser extent, Casino (with the story of Frank Cullotta). Since 2006, there have been a total of 13 regular series, plus a special series called Kidnapped Abroad. The thirteenth series began airing in January 2020."

The awards honour British people who have acted bravely or extraordinarily in challenging situations and have been presented solely by Carol Vorderman since 1999, and co-presented by Ashley Banjo since 2021. The Pride of Britain Award winners are chosen by a panel of celebrities and well-known figures from a range of backgrounds, and has included multiple appearances by Simon Cowell, Richard Branson, Fiona Phillips, Christine Bleakley, Magdi Yacoub, Richard Wallace, Eamonn Holmes and Aled Jones, chaired from 1999 to 2004 by Piers Morgan and from 2005 to 2006 by Peter Willis, founder of the awards. The first Pride of Britain Awards were devised by Peter Willis, and held at the Dorchester Hotel in London in May 1999.  They relocated to The London Studios in 2000, and then later relocated to the Grosvenor House Hotel from the 2011 award ceremony. The awards are organised in association with the Daily Mirror, Lidl, ITV, Good Morning Britain and The Prince's Trust. In November 2020, it was announced that STV, Reach plc (owners of Daily Record) and TSB had agreed a deal which sees the Scottish broadcaster commission STV Studios to produce the inaugural Daily Record Pride of Scotland Awards, in partnership with TSB. The 90-minute landmark TV event is already in production and is set to air on STV later in 2020. The deal represents the broadcaster's biggest ever advertiser-funded single programme. On 20 October 2021, it was announced that Ashley Banjo is to co-host the award ceremony with Carol Vorderman, beginning with the 23rd ceremony onwards."

        "content": "Due to the declining viewership of the recent Academy Awards ceremonies, AMPAS had contracted an entirely new production team in an attempt to revive interest surrounding both the awards and festivities. In September 2008, the Academy selected producers Bill Condon and Laurence Mark to co-produce the telecast. Nearly three months later, actor Hugh Jackman, who had previously emceed three consecutive Tony Awards ceremonies between 2003 and 2005, was chosen as host of the 2009 gala. Jackman expressed his anticipation of the awards in the few days preceding, and had commented that he was thrilled with preparations for the ceremony. Notable changes were introduced in the production of the telecast. In an attempt to build suspense and curiosity leading up to the awards, Condon and Mark announced that they would not reveal any of the presenters or performers who would participate in the Oscarcast. Another unique feature of the ceremony was that the orchestra performed onstage instead of being relegated to a pit. In a break from previous presentations, five previous Oscar-winning performers presented each of the acting categories as opposed to only one or two. In addition, the Academy announced that for the first time since Oscar began broadcasting on television, film studios would be able to televise advertisements promoting their upcoming films. Furthermore, a montage of upcoming 2009 films was shown over the ceremony's closing credits. Several other people participated in the production of the ceremony. Chris Harrison hosted \"Road to the Oscars\", a weekly behind-the-scenes video blog on the Oscar ceremony website. David Rockwell designed a new set and stage design for the ceremony. Film historian and author Robert Osborne greeted guests entering the festivities at the Hollywood and Highland Center. Film director Judd Apatow filmed a comedy montage which featured Seth Rogen and James Franco reprising their roles from Pineapple Express. Director Baz Luhrmann produced a song and dance number saluting movie musicals. Peter Gabriel, who was originally scheduled to perform his nominated song \"Down to Earth\" from WALL-E during the live broadcast, declined to perform after learning that he would be allowed to sing only 65\u00a0seconds of the song during the ceremony's Best Original Song nominee performances. Gabriel still attended the ceremony but singer John Legend, backed by the Soweto Gospel Choir, performed the song in place of Gabriel."

However, one of the nominees for Best Picture had grossed over $100\u00a0million before the nominations were announced (compared with none from the previous year). The combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees when the Oscars were announced was $188\u00a0million with an average gross of $37.7\u00a0million per film.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $104.4\u00a0million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by Slumdog Millionaire ($44.7\u00a0million), Milk ($20.7\u00a0million), Frost/Nixon ($8.8\u00a0million), and finally The Reader ($8.3\u00a0million). Among the rest of the top 50 releases of 2008 in U.S. box office before the nominations, 33 nominations went to nine films on the list. Only The Dark Knight (1st), WALL-E (5th), Kung Fu Panda (6th), Bolt (19th), Tropic Thunder (20th), and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (21st) were nominated for directing, acting, screenwriting, Best Picture or Animated Feature. The other top-50 box office hits that earned nominations were Iron Man (2nd), Wanted (16th), and Hellboy II: The Golden Army (41st)."

Television critic Robert Bianco of USA Today gave Jackman an average review but extolled producers Condon and Mark saying that the broadcast felt \"faster and more intimate without sacrificing Hollywood glamour.\" Vanity Fair columnist Julian Sancton gave high marks for Jackman's hosting performance stating \"After several years of glamour-deflating wisecracks from blas\u00e9 hosts like Jon Stewart, Ellen DeGeneres, and Steve Martin, the new producers hired an M.C. who was willing to break a sweat.\" Film critic Roger Ebert lauded Jackman's performance noting that he \"would be a charmer as host, and he was.\" Of the show itself, Ebert added, \"It was the best Oscar show I've ever seen, and I've seen plenty.\" Other media outlets were more critical of the show. Los Angeles Times columnist Mary McNamara was thought Jackman's performance \"obliterated all memory\" of David Letterman's hosting the ceremony in 1995, which was widely panned. Time television critic James Poniewozik wrote that Jackman was \"charming and game and I bet he absolutely killed in the room. But he didn\u2019t really project beyond the room, nor did he much seem to be trying to.\" He also noted that while there were some entertaining moments, \"the broadcast overall had problems of pacing.\" Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune remarked, \"The whole thing was driven by a manic desire to bring some old-school glamor to the proceedings.\" She added that the long introductions praising the acting nominees slowed down the proceedings."

For the second straight year, a freshman drama series came into the ceremony with a bevy of major nominations, but failed to win for Outstanding Drama Series. ER led all shows with 11 major nominations and won three major awards, but lost the top prize to NYPD Blue, which was in a similar situation to ER the previous year. Candice Bergen's win for the seventh season of Murphy Brown made her the third performer to win five Emmys for playing the same character. She declined to be submitted for any future seasons of the show. Marvin Hamlisch's win made him the sixth person to become an EGOT."

This record has since been passed by The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, whose winning streak was ten years, but for the main two genres, it was not matched until 2014, when the ABC sitcom Modern Family won its fifth consecutive award for Outstanding Comedy Series. The Practice won Outstanding Drama Series and tied for the most major wins overall with three. For the second straight year, medical drama ER came into the night as the most nominated program, but once again walked away empty handed, going 0/9 in major categories. Ally McBeal became the first hour-long series to be nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series since Love, American Style in 1971. This year saw the Emmys move to a new venue, the Shrine Auditorium, marking the return of the award ceremony to Los Angeles for the first time since the 1976 Emmy Awards, following a 20-year residency at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium outside L.A. in Pasadena. As of the 2020 Emmy Awards ceremony, this is the last year where all the nominees for Outstanding Drama Series were from the broadcast networks."

CBS broadcast the Primetime event and E! broadcast the Creative Arts event; both took place at Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, California. The nominations were announced on July 16, 2009. On July 13, 2009, the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences announced that Neil Patrick Harris would host the Primetime ceremony (even going so far as to play Dr. Horrible at one point). The Creative Arts Emmy Awards for prime time were hosted by Kathy Griffin on September 12. After the previous year's lackluster performance in ratings, the Primetime Emmy Awards were hoping to achieve success by selecting Harris as sole host, as opposed to a group of hosts as in the previous year. The 61st Primetime Emmy Awards earned a 4.2 rating in the 18\u201349 demo and drew 13.3 million, 1.1 million more than the previous year's all-time low. 30 Rock became the sixth show to win Outstanding Comedy Series three consecutive years, winning three major awards on that night. 30 Rock made history when it smashed the record for most major nominations by a comedy series with 18. The Cosby Show had held the record of 13 since 1986, while 30 Rock had tied this the previous year. The 18 major nominations became the third biggest record of all time, behind Roots record number of 21 in 1977 and NYPD Blues mark of 19 in 1994. These records still stand. The drama field also crowned the defending champion, AMC's Mad Men. It won two major awards on that night. After airing for fifteen seasons, ER went out a winner as its series finale won for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series. This was the first major win for ER since 2001. Cherry Jones became the first from a Fox network show to win the award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama series but also the second female ever from Fox to win a Major Acting award since Gillian Anderson in 1997. History was also made by The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Amazing Race. Both programs won their series categories for the seventh straight year, this broke the record for most consecutive victories in a major category of six that was held by The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Cagney & Lacey. The Amazing Race would lose the following year. However, in 2013, The Daily Shows streak was finally snapped by The Colbert Report, after a record of ten consecutive wins."

It was part of the annual Star Awards organised by MediaCorp for its Chinese language division (Channel 8 and Channel U). The awards took place at 26 April 2009 starting at 7pm at MediaCorp Studios, followed by a post-show party airing on Channel U after the ceremony ended. The nominations were announced on 24 February 2009, and the popularity awards later on 27 March. As like previous years, most technical category awards were presented outside the ceremony. The Best Info-Ed Programme Host award was introduced to recognise infotainment show hosts. The nomination lists for the main categories were announced on 24 February 2009. Nominations for the popularity awards (Top 10 Most Popular Male and Female Artistes) were announced on 27 March 2009. In contrast of previous Star Awards ceremonies which were held at the end of the year (month of December), a change in the eligibility period for television season (from September of each year to a full calendar year) resulted in 2008 having no ceremonies, and this was the first award ceremony in Star Awards history to be held on the month of April and the format had remained for the future ceremonies since; however, the format was disrupted in the 2020 ceremony as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic which caused the ceremony to be postponed from the usual April. Due to a format change on having two shows in the following year, this was the last Star Awards ceremony, to present the Technical Awards outside the main show until Star Awards 2016, as well as hosting a single award ceremony (not counting prelude or special episodes) until Star Awards 2017. The Little Nyonya became the biggest winner for the 2009 ceremony, having records of breaking the number of nominations and wins with 16 and 9, respectively, surpassing the former record holder in the 2003 ceremony's drama, Holland V, which got 10 and 7, respectively. The record for the nominations would remain held until the 2014 ceremony, where it was first beaten by The Dream Makers (season 1), which had 21 nominations and a record-tying nine wins; the number of wins would also be beaten in the 2016 ceremony, in which The Dream Makers (season 2) surpassed the record of both nominations and wins with 26 and 12, respectively."

        "content": "The Political Cesspool is a weekly far-right talk radio show founded by Tennessean political activist James Edwards and syndicated by the organizations Liberty News Radio Network and Accent Radio Network in the United States. First broadcast in October 2004 twice a week from radio station WMQM, per Edwards it has been simulcast on Stormfront Radio, a service of the white nationalist Stormfront website and as of 2011 is broadcast on Saturday nights on WLRM, a blues and southern soul radio station in Millington, Tennessee. Its sponsors include the white separatist Council of Conservative Citizens and the Institute for Historical Review, a Holocaust denial group. According to its statement of principles, the show stands for the \"Dispossessed Majority\" and represents \"a philosophy that is pro-White.\" It has attracted criticism\u2014including from The Nation, The New Republic, the Stephen Roth Institute, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), and the Anti-Defamation League\u2014for its promotion of anti-semitic, white nationalist and white supremacist views. According to the SPLC, the show has featured a \"Who's Who of the radical right\", including members of the Ku Klux Klan; they say Edwards has probably done more than anyone in America to promote neo-Nazis, Holocaust deniers and other extremists. The show features Edwards and his co-hosts Keith Alexander, Bill Rolen, Winston Smith, and Eddie Miller, as well as producer Art Frith. Former staffers include Geoff Melton, Jess Bonds and co-founder Austin Farley. Its guests have included author Jerome Corsi, Minuteman Project leader Jim Gilchrist, former Constitution Party presidential candidate Michael Peroutka, actor Sonny Landham, British National Party leader Nick Griffin, Vermont secessionist Thomas Naylor, and paleoconservative activist Pat Buchanan. It is carried by at least three licensed terrestrial radio stations in the United States and on network feeds on the Galaxy 19 communications satellite."

        "content": "Edwards is a far-right political activist from Memphis, Tennessee, described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a rising star of the modern white-nationalist movement. They write that he is articulate, charming, and at ease in front of the public, as well as in television and radio studios. He attended Briarcrest Christian School, a private school in Memphis, and in ninth grade transferred into a Christian-nationalist homeschooling program, a decision that he said led him into political activism. In 2000 he volunteered for Pat Buchanan's presidential campaign, and in 2002 ran unsuccessfully for the Tennessee House of Representatives. It was during this campaign that he met fellow activist Austin Farley, who was on the ballot against him. In October of that year, he and Farley established The Political Cesspool. In 2007, Edwards was part of a panel that appeared on CNN's Paula Zahn Now, along with Roland S. Martin and Jesse Lee Peterson. The purpose was to discuss racial segregation in American cities. He told Zahn that white children should seek out those who share \"the same values and traditions and heroes,\" and that \"forced integration\" was a \"march toward totalitarianism.\" He said: \"Crime and violence follow African-Americans wherever they go, and if you think that is racist, then spend some time on the mean streets of south Memphis.\" Martin described his remarks as unfit for national television. Edwards made a second appearance on Paula Zahn Now in 2009, during which he said: \"Whites are in for the fight of their lives. America is becoming balkanized. We are being robbed of having a future in the very nation our ancestors carved from the wilderness.\" In 2010, he became involved with a new party, the American Freedom Party, which advocates white nationalism and a form of economic nationalism known as the Third Position. Also in 2010 he self-published a book, Racism, Schmacism: How Liberals use the \"R\" Word to Push the Obama Agenda, distributed by CreateSpace, a self-publishing printer."

        "content": "Other staff at The Political Cesspool include Bill Rolen, Eddie \"The Bombardier\" Miller, Keith Alexander, and Winston Smith. According to the show's website, most of the staff claim descent from Confederate soldiers. The show was initially broadcast on AM\u00a01600 WMQM, a Memphis-based radio station, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Edwards and Farley invited friends Bill Rolen, a board member of the Council of Conservative Citizens, and Jess Bonds as guest hosts, as well as radio technician Art Frith. Frith had previously worked for a number of other radio stations including American Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS) (in Keflavik, Iceland; Anchorage, Alaska; and Nea Makri, Greece), KFQD (in Anchorage), and WBCK (in Battle Creek, Michigan). In 2005 the group moved to WMQM's Millington-based sister station, AM\u00a01380 WLRM, and switched to a nightly schedule, Monday through Friday. Farley left the program in November of that year. Two years later, Geoff Melton, a former co-host, joined to help set up the show's website and the show entered syndication with Dixie Broadcasting Radio Network. The program went on hiatus on February 15, 2008, because staff members said they needed a break, but returned to the airwaves in June 2008 on WLRM on Saturday nights. One year later, it switched from Republic Broadcasting Network to Liberty News Radio Network. As of August 2009, Bonds and Melton are no longer affiliated with the program. Frith now lives in Nashville, Michigan, but remains a part of the show's staff. Since WLRM is not audited by Arbitron, the show's ratings are unknown. The show is listener-supported and, according to Edwards, receives more donations from Florida than from any other state."

        "content": "The Political Cesspool has over the years featured many guest appearances, including political activists, Holocaust deniers, economists, and musicians. Former Tennessee gubernatorial candidate Carl \"Twofeathers\" Whitaker, who claims partial Native-American ancestry and is known for his strong support of the Minuteman movement, has appeared on the show, as has conservative Native-American activist David Yeagley. Filmmakers Merlin Miller (A Place to Grow, Jericho), who was the 2012 presidential nominee of the American Third Position (now known as the American Freedom Party), and Craig Bodeker (A Conversation about Race) have featured. Author Jerome Corsi was interviewed in July 2008. During the discussion he spoke about his financial newsletter, and promoted his book The Obama Nation, which includes several statements that have been widely described as racist; for example, he opined that US President Barack Obama identifies more with his \"African blood\" than his American roots and that the President \"rejects everyone white, including his mother and his grandparents\". Corsi scheduled another promotional appearance on The Political Cesspool, but one month later he canceled this appearance, citing \"travel plans that changed\". Edwards said that he believed the incident \"just goes to show what incredible pressure everyone in public life is under to never have anything to do with anyone who speaks up for the interests of white people.\" Fellow authors John Derbyshire and Steve Sailer have also been guests. In July 2011, WorldNetDaily columnist Ilana Mercer appeared on the show. Constitution Party nominee Michael Peroutka used his appearance in 2004 to promote his presidential campaign.  Party member Michael Goza described the show as \"Christian/Constitutionalist\", and \"a great blessing to our cause\". Thomas Naylor, of the Vermont secessionist organization Second Vermont Republic, appeared on the show to celebrate Confederate History Month in April 2007, while American Freedom Party Chairman Bill Johnson appeared to promote his party. On May 8, 2006, Minuteman Project leader Jim Gilchrist spoke on the program. Co-host Bill Rolen agreed with Gilchrist's view that illegal immigrants' intentions are to \"just squat here and plunder whatever social benefits our programs provide them\". However, Rolen disagreed with Gilchrist's claim that illegal immigration was \"the 21st century slave trade\". Gilchrist's colleague in the Minuteman movement, Chris Simcox, has also been a guest of the show. Paul Babeu, the sheriff of Pinal County, Arizona, appeared on The Political Cesspool on July 10, 2010 to discuss illegal immigration; during the interview, he referred to James Edwards as a \"great American\". Less than two weeks later, Babeu's spokesman issued an apology, saying that he had not researched the show thoroughly enough before scheduling the interview and that Babeu has a policy of not conducting interviews with hate groups. Babeu himself said that he was \"hoodwinked\" into appearing on the show and that he rejects \"any hate or bigotry\". Prior to the interview, cohost Eddie Miller said that \"Of all the people we\u2019ve interviewed on this radio show, I would say the only people that came close to getting me this excited was Dr. David Duke.\" Following Babeu's spokesman's apology, Edwards alleged that Babeu was aware of the show's true ideology prior to appearing on the show, saying: \"For Sheriff Babeu to change his mind and now regret coming on our show, for whatever reason, is his right. For him to act as though he had no idea of our ideology is a lie.\" As a result of the controversy surrounding Babeu's appearance on the show, Arizona U.S. Senate candidate J. D. Hayworth asked his primary opponent, John McCain, to drop several campaign ads featuring McCain and Babeu. In 2011, another sheriff, Dennis Spruell of Montezuma County, Colorado, also apologized after appearing on the show without knowing its actual agenda. Paleoconservative activist and former presidential candidate Pat Buchanan has appeared twice as of 2011. In a June 2008 interview initiated and arranged by his publicist, he promoted his book Churchill, Hitler and the Unnecessary War. During the broadcast, Buchanan defended Charles Lindbergh against charges of antisemitism, stating that his reputation \"has been blackened because of a single speech he gave and a couple of paragraphs in it where he said that\u00a0... the Jewish community is beating the drums for war\u00a0but frankly, no one has said what he said was palpably untrue.\" At the end of the interview, James Edwards said, \"Mr. Buchanan, thank you so much for coming back on our program, for fighting for our people.\" Previously, in September 2006, Buchanan had made an appearance to promote his book State of Emergency; during this interview, he said that \"we are being invaded by people of different cultures\" and argued that Americans \"cannot survive a bifurcated culture or a heavily Hispanicized culture, tilted towards Mexico\u00a0... I think that's the beginning of the end of the United States.\" Self-proclaimed \"racial realist\" Jared Taylor, whom James Edwards considers to be a close friend, has appeared on at least ten occasions. Although describing itself as \"America First\", the show has also hosted foreign guests, including Croatian white nationalist Tomislav Suni\u0107, Australian white nationalist Drew Fraser, Russian Austrian School economist Yuri N. Maltsev, British lawyer Adrian Davies, Canadian white supremacist Paul Fromm, Canadian conservative blogger Kathy Shaidle, and British National Party (BNP) leaders Simon Darby and Nick Griffin; Griffin appeared as a guest before and after his election to the European Parliament. During his post-election appearance, Griffin attributed the BNP's electoral successes to a fear of \"creeping process of Islamification\". Actor Mel Gibson's father, Hutton Gibson, has also appeared on the show. During his appearance, he referred to Pope Benedict XVI as a \"homosexual\" and claimed that \"half the people in the Vatican are queer.\""

        "content": "The show has frequently been criticised by anti-racist groups and individuals (such as the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), Anti-Defamation League (ADL), Stephen Roth Institute, and journalist Max Blumenthal) over its stated ideology. The Political Cesspool was added to the Southern Poverty Law Center's hate group watch list in 2006. James Edwards was \"ecstatic\", saying \"I don't think you've arrived in the conservative movement until you've made it to the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hate Watch\". Edwards describes the SPLC as a group composed of \"communists and civil rights hustlers\". The SPLC's Hatewatch has referred to The Political Cesspool as \"an overtly racist, anti-Semitic radio show hosted by [a] self-avowed white nationalist\" and as \"the nexus of hate in America\". The Anti-Defamation League has also criticized the show; Edwards has attacked the ADL as \"America's most powerful hate group\" and has claimed that its definition of a \"neo-Nazi [is] any white person who disagrees with a Jew\". Author John Avlon, a former speechwriter for Rudy Giuliani, has described The Political Cesspool as \"avowedly white supremacist\". Max Blumenthal, who reported on an attempt by one of the show's staff to advertise at a rally for Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, described The Political Cesspool as having a \"racist ideology\", and highlighted anti-Semitic, racist, and homophobic comments that Edwards had made on his blog. The Stephen Roth Institute has also commented on the show, noting that \"[James] Edwards openly espoused many of his guests' views and during speeches to extremist audiences, including members of the white supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens and the racist League of the South, he gained the support of a wide array of extremists.\" In an article about antisemitism in Belgium, the Institute commented on the show's interview with Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian Parliament and a leader of the extremist Vlaams Belang movement. Newsweek used one of Winston Smith's statements to argue that the rise in popularity of white nationalism and supremacy is due to the combination of the late-2000s recession and the election of a black president. Many such groups have been attempting to gain new recruits and increase their political influence by rebranding themselves as defenders of \"white heritage\" while de-emphasizing their dislike of minorities and Jews. Smith states, \"[t]he emphasis is different now. We don't talk as much about what blacks have done to us; we're more focused on ourselves and our own culture.\""

        "title": "The Political Cesspool_City Park demonstration",
        "content": "In 2005, the staff of The Political Cesspool organized a rally at the Tennessee area known as Confederate Park, which, along with two other Confederacy-themed parks in downtown Memphis, has been the subject of a longtime controversy for honoring Confederate soldiers and ideals. The park had been criticized earlier by a black Shelby County official, which attracted the notice of New York-based activist Al Sharpton, who was invited by the Reverend LaSimba Gray to hold a demonstration in Memphis. Sharpton planned a march called the Rally for Dignity from downtown Memphis to another park honoring Confederate Lieutenant General Nathan Bedford Forrest who was involved early in the organization of the Ku Klux Klan. Sharpton canceled the march after Edwards and The Political Cesspool staff obtained a permit to demonstrate in Confederate Park, located along Sharpton's planned march route. Sharpton settled for a protest at Forrest Park. At the demonstration, he argued that \"We need to show the rest of the world that the day for honoring people like this is over\", and said in an interview that his objections were not related to race but to Forrest's Civil War-era (1861\u20131865) actions against the United States. Estimates of attendance at the rallies vary; according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, James Edwards attracted about 200 white counter-demonstrators to the Confederate Park vigil, while Sharpton's protest at Forrest Park attracted a few dozen black demonstrators, whom Edwards referred to as \"rabble\". The Memphis Flyer estimated that Sharpton attracted about 250\u00a0supporters. In the aftermath of the city park controversy, show affiliates Edwards, Farley, Bonds, and Rolen received the \"Dixie Defender Award\" from the Sons of Confederate Veterans. Later that year, Memphis city councilman E. C. Jones awarded Edwards and Farley with a certificate \"in appreciation of outstanding contributions to the community\". Edwards and Farley also received an honorary city council membership from Jones, who had previously appeared on The Political Cesspool. According to The Commercial Appeal, Jones had not listened to the show before the incident, and was unaware of its ideology. After a reporter informed him of the program's agenda, Jones initially refused to apologize. However, after another reporter confronted him with more details about the show's ideology, he changed his view, saying that he probably would not appear again. Carol Chumney, another member of the Memphis City Council, was also invited to appear on The Political Cesspool, but ultimately declined the invitation after listening to an episode of the show; Chumney said, \"what I heard was about advocating for prostitution\u00a0... So I told them I had other commitments.\""

By the mid-2000s, the awards ceremony had attracted some international interest due to the spread of Hallyu, and it aired in China and Japan in 2008. In 2009, the event was renamed the Mnet Asian Music Awards (MAMA) to reflect its expansion outside of South Korea. In 2010, MAMA was held in Macau, marking the first time it was held outside of South Korea. The following year, in 2011, MAMA was held in Singapore, and was then held in Hong Kong from 2012 to 2017. In 2017, the awards ceremony was expanded to four nights, and parts of the event were held in Vietnam and Japan, in addition to Hong Kong. In 2018, MAMA had three parts and was held in three countries; South Korea hosted the MAMA for the first time in nine years, together with Japan and Hong Kong. In 2020, MAMA was held online only and took place in South Korea only due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On July 20, 2021, it was reported by Ilgan Sports that the 2021 Mnet Asian Music Awards is undergoing discussion for the event to be held in Hong Kong despite the ongoing pandemic and travel restriction."

Both companies said the reason for their boycott was that they questioned the fairness of the voting process. In particular, SM Entertainment said that Girls' Generation had held the #1 spot on a music chart for nine consecutive weeks, but the group never won first place on Mnet's weekly M Countdown music show. The company also criticized a mobile poll which required participants to pay money in order to vote."

The ceremony was hosted by Russell Brand. Beyonc\u00e9, Green Day, and Lady Gaga were tied for the most-awarded acts of the night, winning three awards each. Beyonc\u00e9's \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" would win the award for Video of the Year, while Beyonc\u00e9 and Lady Gaga were both tied for the largest number of nominations with nine, followed by Britney Spears with seven. In the aftermath of his June 2009 death, the show featured various tributes to Michael Jackson, including an opening act featuring a medley of Jackson's biggest hits and a special appearance by Janet Jackson to perform her duet \"Scream\", and the premiere of a trailer for the posthumous documentary film Michael Jackson's This Is It. The ceremony was marred when Kanye West interrupted Taylor Swift's acceptance of the award for Best Female Video, in order to proclaim that despite her victory, Beyonc\u00e9 still had \"one of the best videos of all time\" (in reference to the aforementioned \"Single Ladies\"). When Beyonc\u00e9 was eventually awarded Video of the Year, she acknowledged the moment when she had won her first VMA as part of Destiny's Child, and invited Swift back to the stage to finish her acceptance speech. The incident was highly publicized after the ceremony, with Rolling Stone naming it the \"wildest\" moment in the history of the Video Music Awards in 2013. The broadcast  was seen by a total of 9\u00a0million viewers, a 17% increase over 2008, making it the most-watched VMAs since 2004."

One of the best videos of all time!\" (West was referring to the music video for \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\".) As the audience booed, West handed the microphone back to Swift, flipped off the crowd, and walked off stage. West was subsequently removed from the show. Later in the show, Beyonc\u00e9 won Video of the Year for \"Single Ladies\" and called Swift back to the stage and to let her finish her speech. Various celebrities and industry figures, and prominent political figures such as U.S. President Barack Obama and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, condemned West for the verbal outburst. West apologized on his blog and during an appearance on The Jay Leno Show. Emil Wilbekin, managing editor of Essence magazine, argued that West may have gone too far with his antics this time: \"I think that it was not Kanye's place to speak for Beyonc\u00e9 or to ruin Taylor Swift's moment...  It's OK for Kanye to rattle off about himself, but I think he crossed the line when he decided to speak for other people.\" Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times opined that \"from one vantage point, it was a case of chivalry gone horribly wrong\" as West meant to \"stand up for\" Beyonc\u00e9. She added that when Swift accepted Beyonc\u00e9's invitation to return to the stage, \"The two women [engaged in] a quick sisterly embrace, adding another layer of meaning to an already complicated moment. Now this controversy was about women sticking up for each other, too.\" In 2013, Rolling Stone named the incident the wildest moment in VMA history. The outburst resulted in an Internet meme which consists of images of West being superimposed onto other images with text in the style of his interruption (\"X is one of the greatest Y of all time\", or variants thereon, in some cases preceded by \"I'm really happy for you\" and/or \"I'mma let you finish\").\""

He was also the first acting nominee since Michael Caine at the 45th ceremony in 1973 to achieve this distinction.

        "content": "In June 2010, the AMPAS hired Oscar-winning producer Bruce Cohen and veteran television producer Don Mischer to oversee production of the telecast. \"I'm absolutely ecstatic that Bruce and Don have accepted my invitation to produce and direct the 83rd Academy Awards telecast,\" remarked Academy president Tom Sherak. \"Their work in producing the Academy's inaugural Governors Awards was exceptional and I am confident they will bring their creative vision and extraordinary talent to produce/direct a most memorable Oscar show.\" Although the prior ceremony hosted by Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin had the highest ratings in five years, their combined age was 116 years and the producers wanted to focus on a younger demographic. The unofficial first choice was Justin Timerlake but he declined, feeling it was at least a year too early for him. Opting for younger faces for the ceremony, Cohen and Mischer hired actor James Franco and actress Anne Hathaway as co-hosts of the 2011 ceremony. \"James Franco and Anne Hathaway personify the next generation of Hollywood icons\u00a0\u2014 fresh, exciting and multi-talented. We hope to create an Oscar broadcast that will both showcase their incredible talents and entertain the world on February 27,\" said Cohen and Mischer regarding their selections to host the gala. \"We are completely thrilled that James and Anne will be joining forces with our brilliant creative team to do just that.\" Franco and Hathaway became the first male-female duo to co-host the awards show since comedian Jerry Lewis and actress Celeste Holm presided over the 29th ceremony in 1957. At age 28, Hathaway was also the youngest person to host an Oscar ceremony. Furthermore, AMPAS announced that this year's ceremony was \"the most interactive awards show in history\". The Academy revamped their official website oscar.com to include lists of all the nominees and winners, as well as film trailers and exclusive video content produced by both AMPAS and Oscar telecaster ABC. Also, via the Academy's Twitter and Facebook pages, people could post questions for any actor or celebrity attending the festivities to answer. One of the four Oscar pre-show co-hosts would then pose selected questions to both nominees and attendees alike. For a fee of US$4.99, users had online access to two dozen video streams that would take them from the red carpet, through the ceremony and on to the post-telecast Governors Ball. Several of the cameras utilized 360-degree views that viewers could direct. Several other people participated in the production of the ceremony. For a younger writer, France consulted Judd Apatow, who suggested Jordan Rubin who brought in Megan Amram. William Ross served as musical director and conductor for the ceremony. Production designer Steve Bass built a new stage design for the ceremony. Entertainment Weekly columnist and TV personality Dave Karger greeted guests entering the red carpet. Designer Marc Friedland designed a new envelope heralding the winner of each category made from a high-gloss iridescent metallic gold paper stock, with red-lacquered lining that featured the Oscar statuette stamped in satin gold leaf. During the run-up to the ceremony, television personality Chris Harrison hosted \"Road to the Oscars\", a weekly behind-the-scenes video blog. Ben Mankiewicz hosted the official ABC pre-show, giving professional betting odds for the winners. PS22 Chorus children's choir performed \"Over the Rainbow\" from The Wizard of Oz at the end of the ceremony. According to Rubin, Hathaway was heavily involved during the month of preparation. Franco on the other hand was busy shooting movies, while teaching a class and getting both his masters and his PhD. When filming started, Hathaway was focused and determined while Franco was more laid back, causing friction. In the closing weeks, Franco went back to Apatow who hired four additional writers; in response, Hathaway brought in Liz Feldman. This resulted last-minute scrambling. According to Amram, \"[a] lot of stuff that made it into the show was written a few days beforehand.\" Franco immediately left after the show ended, catching a flight to make a morning seminar on medieval manuscripts at Yale."

        "content": "For the second consecutive year, the field of major nominees included at least one blockbuster at the American and Canadian box offices. However, only three of the nominees had grossed over $100\u00a0million before the nominations were announced, compared with five from the previous year. The combined gross of the ten Best Picture nominees when the Oscars were announced was $1.2 billion, the second-highest ever behind 2009. The average gross was $119.3 million. Two of the ten Best Picture nominees were among the top ten releases in box office during the nominations. At the time of the announcement of nominations on January 25, Toy Story 3 was the highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees with $414.9\u00a0million in domestic box office receipts. The only other top ten box office hit to receive a nomination was Inception which earned $292.5\u00a0million. Among the remaining eight nominees, True Grit was the next-highest-grossing film with $137.9\u00a0million followed by The Social Network ($95.4\u00a0million), Black Swan ($83.2\u00a0million), The Fighter ($72.6\u00a0million), The King's Speech ($57.3\u00a0million), The Kids Are All Right ($20.8\u00a0million), 127 Hours ($11.2\u00a0million), and finally Winter's Bone ($6.2\u00a0million). Of the top 50 grossing movies of the year, 55 nominations went to 15 films on the list. Only Toy Story 3 (1st), Inception (5th), How to Train Your Dragon (9th), True Grit (17th), The Social Network (29th), The Town (32nd), Black Swan (38th), and The Fighter (45th) were nominated for directing, acting, screenwriting, Best Picture or Animated Feature. The other top-50 box office hits that earned nominations were Alice in Wonderland (2nd), Iron Man 2 (3rd), Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\u00a0\u2014 Part 1 (6th), Tangled (10th), Tron: Legacy (12th), Salt (21st), and Unstoppable (39th)."

        "content": "The show received a negative reception from most media publications. According to writer Bruce Vilanch, the crowd enjoyed the starting short film, but when Franco and Hathaway came on stage, it shifted. According to Rubin, Hathaway \"was embracing their arrival on stage\" while Franco was filming the crowd on his phone. Mara Reinstein of The Ringer said there was no single moment of failure but described the broadcast as \"death by a thousand paper cuts.\" Film critic Roger Ebert said, \"Despite the many worthy nominated films, the Oscarcast was painfully dull, slow, witless, and hosted by the ill-matched James Franco and Anne Hathaway. She might have made a delightful foil for another partner, but Franco had a deer-in-the-headlights manner and read his lines robotically.\" He went on to praise the winners of the night, but he ended his review with the words, \"Dead. In. The. Water.\" Writer David Wild called it \"the world's most uncomfortable blind date between the cool rocker stoner kid and the adorable theater camp cheerleader.\" Television critic Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter commented, \"In what could go down as one of the worst Oscar telecasts in history, a bad and risky idea\u00a0\u2014 letting two actors host\u00a0\u2014 played out in spectacularly unwatchable fashion on the biggest of all nights for the film world.\" He also added, \"These Oscars were a bore-fest that seemed to drag on relentlessly but listlessly.\" Gail Pennington of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote that the ceremony \"felt a little like a bad night on Saturday Night Live\u00a0\u2014 awkward, slow and not particularly entertaining.\" Regarding the hosts, she quipped that Hathaway \"at least tried\", but she remarked, \"Franco seemed half asleep, or possibly stoned.\" Some media outlets received the broadcast more positively. Entertainment Weekly television critic Ken Tucker stated that the show was \"Funny, poised, relaxed, and smart, Anne Hathaway and James Franco made for marvelous Oscar hosts. Their combination of respect and informality struck the right tone for the night, a happily surprising production that had its share of fine moments both planned and ad-libbed.\" On the overall aspect of the ceremony, they concluded \"all in all, it was a fun, briskly paced night.\" Mary McNamara from the Los Angeles Times commented, \"The two seemed to be following the directive to \"first do no harm,\" as if they knew they couldn't score as big as Jimmy Fallon did with the Emmy Awards, but were determined to avoid becoming morning show fodder like Ricky Gervais was after this year's Golden Globes. The result was a show that moved along, with a few draggy bits and high notes, like precisely what it was: a very long and fancy awards show.\" Her review further said \"Overall, the evening had an oddly business-like feel, a mind-numbing evenness that was exacerbated by the relentless predictability of the winners, and the fact that none of the acting winners were played off no matter how long their \"thank-yous\" went.\""

The top shows of the night were Mary Tyler Moore, which, in its final season, won its third consecutive Outstanding Comedy Series Award, it also became the first comedy series to gain eleven major nominations (since broken). Upstairs, Downstairs, also in its final season, won its third Outstanding Drama Series Award in four years (it competed as a miniseries in 1976, and won that category too). But the overwhelming champion of the ceremony was the miniseries Roots. Roots set several milestones and broke multiple records during the night. It became the first show to receive at least twenty major nominations (21). Adding its nominations in Creative Arts categories, its total expands to 37. Both records still stand for all shows. It was the first show to gain every nomination in an acting category. Its thirteen acting nominations tied the record set the previous year by Rich Man, Poor Man, however all of Roots nominations came in the miniseries category, while Rich Man, Poor Man had nominations cross over into the drama series field. Roots became the first miniseries, and second show overall, along with All in the Family in 1972, to win six of seven major categories. All but one of Roots eight episodes were nominated for major awards (Part VII). Another distinction of the night was that Mary Kay Place won a Major Acting award for a TV show (Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman) that had no major network, only broadcast in Syndication - the first time this rare feat has occurred. With this ceremony, the Primetime Emmys began a long residency at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium that would continue until 1997."

While the first show was still held at MediaCorp TV Theatre, the second show was, for the third time in Star Awards history, being held on the new location of Resorts World Sentosa, after 1996 and 2006. Also introduced this year were the six awards, Favourite Male Character, Favourite Female Character, Most Unforgettable TV Villain, Male Media Darling, Female Media Darling and Rocket Award, all of which were awarded on the first show (\u4eae\u95ea\u516b\u65b9 (lit. Dazzling Awards)). The first three awards were decided by online voting that run from 1 March until 11 April with the results being announced during the first ceremony. The Rocket Award was also introduced, which mainly focuses on the artiste who contributed the most improvement throughout the past year. Both of the ceremonies were broadcast live on 18 and 25 April 2010. The post-show was held after the second ceremony at 10pm on Channel U.

The ceremony was scheduled well after its usual late-February date to avoid conflicting with the 2014 Winter Olympics. During the ceremony, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 24 categories. The ceremony was televised in the United States by ABC, and produced by Neil Meron and Craig Zadan and directed by Hamish Hamilton. Actress Ellen DeGeneres hosted the show for the second time, having previously hosted the 79th ceremony held in 2007. In related events, the Academy held its 5th annual Governors Awards ceremony at the Grand Ballroom of the Hollywood and Highland Center on November 16, 2013. On February 15, 2014, in a ceremony at The Beverly Hills Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by hosts Kristen Bell and Michael B. Jordan. 12 Years a Slave won three awards, including Best Picture. Other winners included Gravity with seven awards, Dallas Buyers Club with three, Frozen and The Great Gatsby with two, and Blue Jasmine, The Great Beauty, Helium, Her, The Lady in Number 6: Music Saved My Life, Mr Hublot, and 20 Feet from Stardom with one. The telecast garnered nearly 44 million viewers in the United States, making it the most watched Oscar ceremony since the 72nd Academy Awards in 2000."

However, actor Seth MacFarlane announced that he would not host the Oscars for a second time. In a statement released through Twitter, he wrote \"Traumatized critics exhale: I'm unable to do the Oscars again. Tried to make it work schedule-wise, but I need sleep.\" Furthermore, actress and comedian Tina Fey, who co-hosted the 70th Golden Globe Awards more than a month earlier with fellow Saturday Night Live alumnus Amy Poehler, told Huffington Post columnist Mike Ryan that she would reject any offer to host an Oscar telecast commenting, \"I just feel like that gig is so hard. Especially for, like, a woman\u00a0\u2013 the amount of months that would be spent trying on dresses alone\u00a0\u2013 no way.\" Shortly after the election of AMPAS president Cheryl Boone Isaacs in August 2013, Meron and Zadan announced that comedian and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres would host the 2014 ceremony. They explained their decision to bring back DeGeneres as host saying, \"As a longtime friend, we had always hoped to find a project for us to do together and nothing could be more exciting than teaming up to do the Oscars. There are few stars today who have Ellen's gift for comedy, with her great warmth and humanity. She is beloved everywhere and we expect that the audience at the Dolby Theatre and in homes around the globe will be as excited by this news as we are.\" DeGeneres expressed that she was thrilled to be selected to emcee the gala again, commenting, \"I am so excited to be hosting the Oscars for the second time. You know what they say\u00a0\u2013 the third time's the charm.\" As with last year's theme of music and the movies, Meron and Zadan centered the show around a theme. This year, they christened the show with a theme of saluting movie heroes commenting, \"By celebrating the gamut of heroes who have enriched our movie-going experience, we hope to create an evening of fun and joy. And that includes the filmmakers and actors who take risks and stimulate us with provocative subjects and daring characters. They are all heroes in the cinematic landscape.\" To coincide with the theme, AMPAS presented an exhibition in the lobby of its Beverly Hills headquarters titled \"The Oscars Celebrate Movie Heroes\". The exhibit featured posters, photographs, and artifacts from 70 different films featuring literary, comic book, and real life heroes. Furthermore, actor Andrew Garfield, who portrayed the titular character in The Amazing Spider-Man, was scheduled to appear onstage with five-year-old cancer survivor Miles Scott with Garfield christening Scott as an \"official superhero\". The segment was scrapped, however, due to time constraints. Several other people were involved with the telecast and its promotion. Tony Award-winning art director Derek McLane designed a new set and stage design for the show. Filmmaker Paul Feig produced and directed a one-minute trailer promoting the event featuring DeGeneres and 250 dancers dancing and lip-synching to the song \"The Walker\" by rock band Fitz and the Tantrums. During the ceremony, actor Channing Tatum introduced a group called \"Team Oscar\". The team consisted of six young film students from colleges across the country selected by AMPAS whose role was to deliver Oscar statuettes to the presenters during the gala. Television personality and former Miss USA titleholder Rachel Smith hosted \"Inside the Oscars\", a behind-the-scenes video blog on the Oscar ceremony website."

Too bad this particular brand of predictable respectability was a bore.\" He also criticized the clip packages saluting movie heroes as \"big a waste of time as Oscar montages almost always are.\" Columnist Alan Sepinwall of HitFix commented, \"It was a long, disjointed ceremony, and what was fun and likely to endure came entirely from the winners and their speeches.\" He went on to say that many of DeGeneres's stunts fell flat and that The Wizard of Oz 75th anniversary tribute \"felt much too random.\" Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said, \"It was a turgid affair, badly directed, poorly produced and featuring an endless string of either tired or wince-inducing moments by DeGeneres, who, by the last 30 or so minutes, seemed to have given up entirely.\" In addition, he noted that the show was overstuffed with montages and stunts that dragged down the pacing of the telecast. Other media outlets received the broadcast more positively. Television critic Matt Roush of TV Guide commented that DeGeneres \"made the Oscars' inevitable dull patches felt less painful than usual.\" He also praised the cast and several musical numbers from the show. Frazier Moore of the Associated Press lauded DeGeneres's performance writing that, \"She seemed to be committed to an unspoken theme for the evening: Humanize Hollywood's glitterati for the viewers. In return, the stars were on their best behavior.\" He concluded, \"All in all, a sleek show was the Oscarcast. Few bombshells, fewer embarrassments, from fade-in to fade-out.\" Entertainment editor Marlow Stern of The Daily Beast raved, \"DeGeneres followed in the footsteps of the most successful awards show hosts\u2014Billy Crystal, the duo of Fey & Poehler, etc.\u2014who have taken advantage of the audience, engaging in gleeful interactions with the plethora of A-listers there (when they're not mocking them).\""

The podcast is released every Monday and is the only Canadian show on the Maximum Fun network. Other than those two segments, the show has \"little in the way of format\". Despite this, the show has been described as having a consistent \"tone, and speed ... whether the guest is a famous LA comedian, or a smaller local one\". The show is also consistent in releasing episodes. As of 2016, the show had only missed two weeks since debuting. The show is usually recorded at Shumka's home studio in Vancouver. Its listeners are referred to as \"bumpers\" after Shumka mistakenly referred to the audience that way in episode 1."

The show is broadcast on TF1 and there have been 22 regular seasons and 7 special seasons. The show has been hosted by Denis Brogniart since the second season. The title of the show Thai \"Ko Lanta\" (roughly translated as \"the island of a million eyes\") - not only is this a reference to the televised nature of the competition (with millions of viewers watching the show) but the title is also the name of filming location of the first season (Ko Lanta Yai, Thailand). Following the basic premise of other international versions of the Survivor format, it features a group of contestants who are marooned in an isolated location, where they must provide food, water, fire, and shelter for themselves. The contestants compete in challenges for rewards and immunity from elimination. The contestants are progressively eliminated from the game as they are voted out by their fellow contestants until only one remains and is declared the winner and awarded the grand prize of \u20ac100,000. Since its debut in 2001, Koh-Lanta has been a huge success in France, regularly finishing first in its timeslot."

        "content": "The show follows the same eneral format as the other editions of the show. The players are split between two \"tribes\", are taken to a remote isolated location and are forced to live off the land with meagre supplies for approximately 6 weeks (3 weeks in special seasons). Frequent physical and mental challenges are used to pit the teams against each other for rewards, such as food or luxuries, or for \"immunity\", forcing the other tribe to attend \"Tribal Council\", where they must vote off one of their players. Once about half the players are remaining, the tribes are merged into a single tribe, and competitions are on an individual basis; winning immunity prevents that player from being voted out. Most players that are voted out at this stage form the \"Tribal Council Jury\". Once down to two people, a final Tribal Council is held where the remaining players plead their case to the jury as to why they should win the game. The jury then decides who between the two should be considered the winner and be awarded the grand prize of \u20ac100,000, with the runner-up being awarded \u20ac10,000."

        "content": "Unlike most versions of Survivor, dual winners are possible in some seasons where the jury vote resulted in a tie (as occurred in Koh-Lanta: Bocas del Toro and Koh-Lanta: Palawan). In this case both contestants are considered the winners and each receive  \u20ac55,000. This differs from most editions of the show as other editions will either never have a jury with an even number of participants or have tie-breaker mechanisms in place (such as Israeli Survivor where the tie will break in favor of the winner of a public vote or in Dutch/Belgian's Expeditie Robinson where a group of former players form a \"grand jury\" and vote to break the tie). Another difference in rules between Koh-Lanta and other editions is how the unexpected eliminations are handled. On Koh-Lanta, when a player is eliminated from the game outside of \"Tribal Council\" (either by being removed for medical reasons, or quitting prior to Raja Ampat), the player is replaced by the most recently eliminated player (or, if no such player is available, by a completely new contestant), who will take their place and the game continues as planned. In other editions, an unexpected elimination is handled by adjusting the events of the game to accommodate the absence of a player (often the upcoming Tribal Council will be cancelled but this will not always be the case)."

TF1 responded that according to the LPO (in English, League for the Protection of Birds), Puffinus pacificus are not a protected species. LPO asked the CSA (broadcasting regulator in France) to take up the case, and the latter also decided to initiate legal action against TF1 and the producer of the Adventure Line Productions program. The petition against the production company was accepted, therefore TF1 was ordered to pay the LPO \u20ac1,000 in damages and \u20ac2,000 for procedural expenses, while the TF1 channel lawsuit against the LPO was rejected."

In his suicide note, he stated that his name has been \"smeared in the media\", leading to his ultimate death. Production later resumed for Koh-Lanta: The New Edition.

The first (and so far only other) death occurred on the 4th season of Bulgarian Survivor (titled Survivor BG: Philippines) when contestant Noncho Vodenicharov died, however unlike Koh-Lanta the production of the series continued."

It awarded the best in Brazilian music, popular culture and internet culture in the year of 2011. For this edition, the concept has undergone a major makeover; after the happy rock band Restart winning all the 5 categories in which it was indicated in the previous edition by its large number of fans voting exaggeratedly (including Act of the Year), and not by its merit; and also the renewal of the station's programming in 2011, which favored even more the music. Under the awards theme \"A m\u00fasica n\u00e3o para\" (The music never stops), this VMB went to have a 100-member expert jury - the VMB Academy - to choose seven of the 11 awards; three new categories: Best Album, Best Album Art and Best Music; and the indication of many independent artists, like Emicida, Marcelo Jeneci and Criolo, valuing the musical production. However, the VMB didn't neglected the pop artists and web hits, keeping categories as Hit of the Year, Web Hit of the Year and Best International Act, and adding a new category: Best Web Video (Video musics made for internet). For the first time, the VMB was held in a television studio (Quanta Studios), unlike the other editions, which were held in auditoriums such as Credicard Hall and Parque de Conven\u00e7\u00f5es do Anhembi. MTV Brasil considers that its structure was the largest in the history of the awards. And it was still divided into three stages: one for the main show, other for the VMBB (The B-side of VMB) and other for the VIP party - which this time took place simultaneously with the main show, and not after it. The first two stages had different live broadcasts - the main show on TV and Internet, and VMBB exclusively on the Internet. Some presentations of the awards - which had several of the meeting of 30 invited artists - had characterized the artists playing simultaneously and synchronously at the three stages of the event."

ABC televised the ceremony in the United States. Comedian and late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel hosted the Primetime Emmys for the first time. Kimmel and Kerry Washington announced the nominations on July 19, 2012. Nick Offerman was originally scheduled to co-announce the nominations, but had to cancel due to travel delays. The Creative Arts Emmy Awards ceremony was held on September 15 and was televised on September 22, 2012 on ReelzChannel. The award for Outstanding Drama Series went to Showtime crime drama Homeland, the first for that network, and which broke Mad Mens four-year hold on the award; while the Outstanding Comedy Series award went for the third year in a row to ABC's Modern Family. This was the first ceremony that none of the four major American broadcasting TV networks were nominated in the categories of Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, and Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. For Britain, the ceremony was noted for the successes of actors Damian Lewis of Homeland and Maggie Smith of Downton Abbey. Of the latter, Dame Maggie not only was PBS' first win in her category, she had won the previous year, for the same role in another category. Hers was also the first win in a major acting category for a Drama Series for PBS since 1975. Mad Men set a new record for the largest \"shutout\" in Emmy history, receiving nominations for 17 awards and winning none. This broke the previous record of 16 nominations without a win, set by Northern Exposure in 1993 and The Larry Sanders Show in 1997. This record was broken by The Handmaid's Tale in 2021, which did not win any of its 21 nominations that year."

        "content": "In 2010, the Acad\u00e9mie Andr\u00e9 Delvaux was established by Patrick Quinet, president of the Francophone Film Producers Association (UPFF), and Luc Jabon, president of Pro Sp\u00e8re, to unite the five branches of the film industry: actors, directors, producers, technicians and writers. It aims to recognize excellence in Belgian francophone cinematic achievements in order to have a Belgian counterpart of the French C\u00e9sar Awards. Charly Herscovici, who created the Magritte Foundation, allowed the academy to use the name of the Belgian artist Ren\u00e9 Magritte. Overseen by the Acad\u00e9mie Andr\u00e9 Delvaux, the Magritte Awards replace the Joseph Plateau Awards, which were disestablished in 2007. During the first ceremony, 18 merit categories and two special awards were presented, honoring artists, directors and other personalities of the film industry for their works during the 2009\u20132010 period."

        "content": "Educational programming began to be broadcast by Rede Globo on 16 January 1978 when the secondary-school oriented Telecurso 2o Grau started broadcasting; it was initially created by Rede Globo in conjunction with the Padre Anchieta Foundation (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Padre Anchieta) and the Roberto Marinho Foundation. Unlike almost all other programs shown by Rede Globo, the program was presented commercial-free for its entire run due to its educational nature, although promos for the network's shows and public service announcements were still shown in between segments of the program. In 1981, Telecurso was expanded from 15 to 30 minutes with the launch of Telecurso 1o Grau, which concentrated on educational lessons for elementary school children. In 1986, the Roberto Marinho Foundation retitled the original program as Novo Telecurso 2o Grau and a new partnership was obtained with Bradesco; the courses featured were authorized to become a valid form of educative material in schools around Brazil, as well as in certain companies. On 2 January 1995, the entire educational programming block was rebranded as Telecurso 2000 and expanded to 45 minutes with the launch of Telecurso 2000 Profissionalizante (which focused on vocational subjects). On 31 March 2008, the program was reformatted as Novo Telecurso, which removed outdated segments of geography and history that were no longer being used and replaced them with philosophy, visual arts, music, theatre, sociology, and Spanish language topics that were aimed at secondary students who have not completed their education. In 2009, a new partnership was attained with SENAI-SP for the vocational segments of the program. On 28 November 2014, Telecurso aired for the last time on Rede Globo. It was replaced by Hora Um, an early-morning news program that premiered on 1 December 2014. The daily edition of Globo Rural aired the last time on the same day; the weekly edition currently airs on Sundays at 8:00\u00a0am."

The ceremony was held on Sunday, September 20, 2015 at the Microsoft Theater in Downtown Los Angeles, California, and was broadcast in the U.S. by Fox. Andy Samberg hosted the show for the first time. The nominations were announced on July 16, 2015. The Creative Arts Emmy Awards ceremony was held on September 12 and was broadcast by FXX on September 19. The Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards ceremony was held on October 28, 2015 at the Loews Hollywood Hotel. The ceremony became notable for breaking two major milestones: Game of Thrones set a new record by winning 12 awards, the most for any show in a single year, up to this date (it was also the second HBO show, after The Sopranos, to win the Outstanding Drama Series award), while Viola Davis became the first African-American woman in Emmy history to win Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her performance as Annalise Keating in How to Get Away with Murder. This year also saw for the first time, two Streaming service networks win four Acting awards: Netflix, with Uzo Aduba in Orange Is the New Black and Reg E. Cathey in House of Cards; and Amazon Studios, with Jeffrey Tambor for Transparent and Bradley Whitford for the same show. The Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series went to the HBO political satire Veep, which not only broke Modern Familys five-year hold on the award but became the second time a premium channel won Outstanding Comedy Series (the first was for HBO's surrealist romantic comedy Sex and the City in 2001)."

        "content": "The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences announced new rule changes for the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards. These new rules are: All voters eligible for a category's nominations are now eligible to vote in that category, providing that they have seen the submitted material and attest to no specific conflicts of interest. The number of nominees in the Outstanding Drama Series and Outstanding Comedy Series categories will expand from six nominees to seven, due to the increase in series production. To clarify the difference between a Comedy series and a Drama series, any show where episodes average a length of 30 minutes is eligible to enter as a comedy and series with episodes that average a length of 1 hour is eligible as a drama. There may be exceptions to the rules, however: producers may formally petition to a new Academy panel to have the show be considered for the alternative category. This panel, consisting of five industry leaders appointed by the Academy Chairman and four appointees from the Board of Governors, will vote on a decision. A two-thirds vote was required for the show to be considered for the alternative category. So far, three petitions have been successful: Glee, Jane the Virgin, and Shameless were voted as eligible for \"Outstanding Comedy Series\". The Outstanding Miniseries was renamed as \"Outstanding Limited Series\". A \"Limited Series\" is defined as a program consisting of two or more episodes totaling 150 minutes as a whole, tell a complete, non-recurring story, and do not have an ongoing storyline and/or main characters in subsequent seasons. A \"Guest Actor\" is now defined as a performer appearing in less than 50% of the program's episodes. Only performers that fit this criteria are allowed to submit. The Outstanding Variety Series category has been split into two separate categories: \"Outstanding Variety Talk\" and \"Outstanding Variety Sketch\"."

The ceremony took place on April 26, 2015, at the Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California,  5:00\u00a0p.m. PST / 8:00\u00a0p.m. EST. The ceremony, televised in the United States by Pop was executive produced by Michael Levitt, Gary Tellalian and Mike Rothman. Talk show host, actress and producer Tyra Banks hosted the show for the first time. The drama pre-nominees were announced on February 4, 2015, and the standard nominations were announced on March 31, 2015, during an episode of The Talk.  In related events, the 42nd Daytime Creative Arts Emmy Awards ceremony was held at the Universal Hilton in Los Angeles on April 24, 2015 with Jeopardy! icon Alex Trebek and The Brady Bunch actress Florence Henderson serving as the ceremony's hosts. Variety reported that the return of the Daytime Emmys on Television was due that the Academy hoped to rebound in viewership after the previous year's internet-only ceremony, which also resulted in a high-volume of no-shows among the nominees. The awards ceremony was also moved up from its normal month in June to April to improve participation since many shows were still in production during that time. The Academy also choose to hold the ceremonies at the Warner Bros. Studios instead of a hotel ballroom like in previous years so participants \"would feel [more] comfortable\". They specifically picked Stage 16, where Casablanca and other famous films were produced. It was later announced that the Lifetime Achievement Award would be presented to Betty White."

Instead, for one day in March 2015, the website will spotlight music videos as, \"music will be the headline act on YouTube.\" Although differences in the presentation format and purpose of the awards were announced, Kia Motors and VICE Media maintained their status as sponsors of the YTMAs."

Shortly afterwards, actor Neil Patrick Harris announced that he would not host the Oscars for a second time. In an interview released from The Huffington Post, he said \"I don't know that my family nor my soul could take it. It's a beast. It was fun to check off the list, but for the amount of time spent and the understandable opinionated response, I don't know that it's a delightful balance to do every year or even again.\" In September 2015, AMPAS recruited David Hill and Reginald Hudlin as producers of the ceremony. \"We're delighted to have this talented team on board,\" AMPAS president Cheryl Boone Isaacs said in a press release announcing the decision, \"David is a true innovator with a dynamic personality. His vast experience as a live events producer, coupled with Reginald's energy, creativity and talent as a filmmaker, is sure to make this year's Oscar telecast a memorable one.\" The following month, Hill and Hudlin selected actor and comedian Chris Rock to host the 2016 telecast. They explained their decision to hire Rock back as host saying, \"Chris Rock is truly the MVP of the entertainment industry. Comedian, actor, writer, producer, director, documentarian\u00a0\u2014 he's done it all. He's going to be a phenomenal Oscar host!\" Rock expressed that he was thrilled to be selected to emcee the gala again, commenting, \"I'm so glad to be hosting the Oscars, it's great to be back.\" Several other individuals participated in the production of the ceremony. Radio disc jockey and personality Ellen K served as announcer for the show. Byron Phillips and Harold Wheeler were hired as music producer and music director respectively. For a fourth consecutive year Derek McLane returned to design a new set for the show. Fatima Robinson was in charge of choreography for the broadcast. For the first time, the Oscar statuettes were manufactured by Polich Tallix Fine Art Foundry in Rock Tavern, New York. In a further effort to streamline acceptance speeches, dedications were displayed on an on-screen ticker, rather than read by the winner. Prior to introducing singer Lady Gaga's performance of Best Original Song nominee \"Til It Happens to You\" from the documentary film The Hunting Ground, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden pleaded with viewers to sign an online pledge supporting \"It's On Us\" to end campus sexual assault."

        "content": "Shortly after the nominations were announced, many news media outlets observed that there was a lack of racial diversity amongst the nominees in major categories. For the second consecutive year, all twenty acting nominees and four out of the five directors nominated were Caucasian. Activist and former attorney April Reign, who was credited with starting the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite, tweeted, \"It's actually worse than last year. Best Documentary and Best Original Screenplay. That's it. #OscarsSoWhite.\" She also noted that while the Caucasian screenwriters of the film Straight Outta Compton earned nominations, the African American cast of the film was overlooked. As a result, the Academy was ridiculed again over social media with the aforementioned hashtag. Moreover, actress Jada Pinkett Smith and director and newly minted Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award recipient Spike Lee announced plans to boycott the ceremony and encouraged others to not watch the telecast in protest of the lack of diversity. Actor and model Tyrese Gibson and rapper 50 Cent also pressured Chris Rock to drop out of his Oscar hosting duties. In response to the criticism, several individuals including AMPAS members voiced their opinions regarding the lack of diversity. Some members defended the Academy saying that the nominations are based on performance and merit, not race. Actress Penelope Ann Miller responded to the criticism by stating \"I voted for a number of black performers, and I was sorry they weren't nominated. To imply that this is because all of us are racists is extremely offensive. I don't want to be lumped into a category of being a racist because I'm certainly not and because I support and benefit from the talent of black people in this business. It was just an incredibly competitive year.\" In an interview with a French radio station, Best Actress nominee Charlotte Rampling said efforts to stage an boycott of the Oscars were \"racist to whites.\" Oscar winning producer Gerald R. Molen commented, \"There is no racism except for those who create an issue. That is the worst kind. Using such an ugly way of complaining,\" He also denounced members criticizing the Academy's choices as \"spoiled brats.\" Others agreed that the Academy had a diversity problem and supported efforts towards change. Best Supporting Actress winner Lupita Nyong'o wrote, \"I am disappointed by the lack of inclusion in this year's Academy Awards nominations. It has me thinking about unconscious prejudice and what merits prestige in our culture.\" She concluded by saying, \"I stand with my peers who are calling for change in expanding the stories that are told and recognition of the people who tell them.\" In a Facebook post, Best Actress winner Reese Witherspoon expressed her frustration with the lack of diversity among the nominees and added, \"Nothing can diminish the quality of their work, but these filmmakers deserve recognition. As an Academy member, I would love to see a more diverse voting membership.\" During an interview with a reporter, President Barack Obama commented on the controversy saying, \"I think when everybody's story is told, then that makes for better art. That makes for better entertainment. It makes everybody feel part of one American family. So I think, as a whole, the industry should do what every other industry should do, which is to look for talent, provide opportunity to everybody.\" A week after the nominations announcement, the Academy announced several rules changes regarding membership in hopes of increasing the number of women and non-white members in the membership by 2020. Beginning in 2016, new members would earn Oscar voting privileges for the next ten years. After that time period, those members may retain voting privileges for another ten years if they have remained active in the motion picture industry. Members would earn lifetime voting privileges if they have served three consecutive ten-year voting eligibility terms or have earned or won an Academy Award. Issacs justified the Academy's decision to overhaul the membership requirements saying, \"The Academy is going to lead and not wait for the industry to catch up; these new measures regarding governance and voting will have an immediate impact and begin the process of significantly changing our membership composition.\" Furthermore, the Academy would establish three new governor seats that will be nominated by Isaacs and confirmed by the Board. However, the Academy's actions also include taking away the membership rights of academy members who have not recently worked in the industry, such as actor Bill Mumy and award-winning screenwriter Patricia Resnick. \"Replacing sexism and racism with ageism is not the answer,\" Resnick said. On the morning of the Oscars, the National Action Network led by civil rights activist Al Sharpton held a protest a few blocks from the Dolby Theatre regarding the Oscar's diversity problems. \"You are out of time,\" Sharpton said in a rebuke to the Academy. \"We are not going to allow the Oscars to continue. This will be the last night of an all-white Oscars.\" In addition, African-American filmmakers Ryan Coogler and Ava DuVernay held a charity event addressing the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, called #JusticeForFlint on the same night as the Oscars. Despite organizers insisting that the event was being held almost simultaneously with the Oscars, many viewed it as an alternative to watching the ceremony."

        "content": "During the show, Rock introduced onstage three children of Asian heritage posing as accountants for PricewaterhouseCoopers saying \"They sent us their most dedicated, accurate and hard working representatives... Please welcome Ming Zhu, Bao Ling and David Moskowitz.\" He also added \"If anybody's upset about that joke, just tweet about it on your phone that was also made by these kids.\" In response to the segment, U.S. Congresswoman Judy Chu expressed her disappointment at Rock, broadcaster ABC, and AMPAS in a press release that read, \"It is not right to protest the exclusion of one group by making jokes at the expense of another. I am so disappointed that the Academy and ABC would rely on such offensive characterizations, especially given the controversy over the lack of diversity.\" Actress Constance Wu tweeted, \"To parade little kids on stage w/no speaking lines merely to be the butt of a racist joke is reductive & gross.\" Furthermore, 25 AMPAS members of Asian descent, including actors Nancy Kwan, Sandra Oh, and George Takei, and director Ang Lee, signed a letter condemning Rock's skit saying, \"In light of criticism over #OscarsSoWhite, we were hopeful that the telecast would provide the Academy a way forward and the chance to present a spectacular example of inclusion and diversity. Instead, the Oscars show was marred by a tone-deaf approach to its portrayal of Asians.\" In a phone interview with the Associated Press, Academy President Isaacs apologized for the joke stating, \"I can understand the feelings and we are setting up a meeting to discuss, because as you well know, no one sets out to be offensive, and I'm very sorry that has happened. I think so much is achieved with dialogue, so much is achieved. And that is what we'll continue to do: have dialogue, listen and just keep fixing.\""

Television critic Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times remarked, \"Rock's Oscars had some of the most powerful moments seen in the telecast's history.\" She concluded that, \"After years of being dissed for its irrelevance, this year's Oscars took action. The results were mixed, to be sure, and Rock did not ever settle into his usual balance of outrage and humanity.\" The New York Times columnist James Poniewozik commented, \"With Chris Rock, the Oscars find a lucky pairing of host and subject.\" In addition, he wrote, \"His performance was an example of something the industry is still trying to learn: that you can achieve both inclusion and entertainment by giving the right person just the right opportunity.\" The Denver Posts Joanne Ostrow wrote, \"Chris Rock poked the elephant in the room at the 2016 Academy Awards, prodded it again and again, and never let up.\" Others were more critical of the show. The Hollywood Reporter columnist Daniel Feinberg remarked, \"Chris Rock led a telecast that had important things to say, but still felt endless.\" In addition he called the ceremony \"overstuffed\" and the on-screen running scroll a \"total failure\". Frazier Moore of the Associated Press quipped, \"When Rock was absent, languor prevailed.\" He added, \"One other beef: The attempt to banish the names of those thanked by winners to a text crawl at the bottom of the screen. If viewers wanted to watch a channel with annoying and distracting text at the bottom of the screen, they'd just tune to a cable-news channel.\" Orlando Sentinel television critic Hal Boedeker gave high marks toward Rock but commented, \"No host, no matter how gifted, can transform the lumbering format into a scintillating event.\" He ended his comments by stating, \"Staging a more entertaining Oscar telecast. Why must the show be a slog?\" The American telecast on ABC drew 34.42 million people over its length, which was a 4% decrease from the previous year's ceremony. An estimated 58 million total viewers watched all or part of the awards. The telecast also garnered lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with a 23.4 household rating. In addition program scored the lower 18-49 demo rating with a 10.5 rating over 31% share. It was the lowest viewership for an Academy Awards telecast since the 80th ceremony, held in 2008. In July 2016, the ceremony presentation received nine nominations for the 68th Primetime Emmys. The following month, the ceremony did not win any of the nominations."

Whereas the planned transgression of this one was less a stiff shot than small beer.\" The ceremony was nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Comedy/Variety (Music, Awards, Tributes) \u2013 Specials, but lost out to Triumph's Election Special 2016."

Nicasio grabbed the mic and said \"My name is Zacari Nicasio. Shout out to Kevin Gates he has an album; Yeezy jumped over the jumpman yes sir...\" Shortly after Nicasio grabbed the mic, Sharon Osbourne kicked him twice, and then Sheryl Underwood told Niciasio \"You ain't gonna pull no Steve Harvey up in here [no] no sir, no sir. Security!\" After Gilbert continued her speech, Aisha Tyler joked about the incident when Gilbert said they are the \"M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce of misfits\" which Tyler replied \"But that guy is not in our club.\" Osbourne added to the joke saying \"Get the **** off my stage!\" Osbourne also flipped off Nicasio twice as he was taken away by security during Gilbert's speech. Julie Chen told Entertainment Tonight moments after the incident \"[Osbourne] always said you mess with one of us you mess with all of us.\" The incident was heavily talked about on their show following the awards. After ranting about his behavior, Osbourne warned him on The Talk, \u201cIf I see him again, I'd kick him again!\" Tyler told him to \"practice yo speech in the bathroom dude\" if he was going interrupt an award show and also mocked his speech on the show as well saying \"Imma give a shout out to Spooky and them and I like cheese sandwiches.\" Gilbert said about being interrupted \"When he first came up I just thought oh somebody's trying to steal the spotlight and it's kinda funny even though it's not right because we wanna speak to our fans and you know all of that. But there was something amusing about it. When it was unintelligible I got scared there was something wrong with him.\" Underwood also mentioned on The Talk that Harvey gave Underwood permission to use that joke because she had been saying it a lot and didn't want to hurt his feelings as he is a personal friend of Underwood. Underwood also stated she almost pushed Nicasio off the stage but she didn't as she feared of a lawsuit saying \"When our boy was coming up to the stage I was like 'Oh hell no' and then I thought if I got on this dude and knocked him down the stairs then maybe its a lawsuit and we all get sued and network close down. For then I thought if I strong-armed the dude and kinda push him off and get him out of here.\" Niciasio had no remorse over the incident but asked Osbourne to apologize and take him to dinner at The Cheesecake Factory. On March 3, 2016, Gilbert, Underwood, and Osbourne brought up the incident again on The Talk during their conversation of a woman defending herself at gunpoint in a convenience store. Glibert said \"I was thinking about [the woman defending herself] when I was watching how I would react and then I realized how I would react because we had it not a criminal situation but the guy [Niciasio] that came up during the People's Choice Awards. You two [Osbourne and Underwood] were kicking [Niciasio] off the stage and I was scared and just went quiet. You know I would just shut down and hand him the money.\" Osbourne joked \"We were just scared that [Niciasio] was gonna sing. That would have been much scarier.\" On June 13, 2016, Sara Gilbert brought up the incident again with Mike Epps who was a guest on The Talk. Ironically, six months prior to the awards, Tyler was asked by Jason Derulo at the 2015 Ubisoft E3 press conference to dance with him after Tyler remarked that she was glad to not dance up there with him as she pointed out she is not a good dancer. Derulo jokingly was disappointed that Tyler didn't crash his performance."

(A similar situation happened for the 6th Critics' Choice Awards in 2001, in which the film Cast Away was voted by referendum to be included among the nominees for Best Picture.) The BFCA faced immediate criticism, including from its own members, over what many saw as an attempt to increase ratings for the awards ceremony's broadcast on A&E (which, is 50% owned by Disney, the company behind Star Wars) on January 17, 2016.

The artistic director for the competition was Carlo Conti, who was appointed to the position for a second consecutive year. The competition took place over five evenings between 9\u201313 February 2016. The selected artists competed during the festival under two different sections: Campioni/Big Artists and Nuove Proposte/Newcomers' . Twenty songs competed in the Big Artists section and eight songs competed in the Newcomers'  section; both competitive sections ran concurrently with each other over the five evenings. All songs in the competition were required to be new compositions performed in the Italian language with some exceptions for words and phrases in other dialects/languages. The songs were performed in the competition live and accompanied by an orchestra. The twenty entries competing in the Big Artists section were presented during the first and second evenings on 9 and 10 February. Ten songs were performed during each evening and were voted upon by a press jury (50%) and public televote (50%) with no eliminations occurring during either evening. All twenty songs advanced to the fourth evening, the semi-final, and faced an additional vote consisting of public televoting (40%), an expert jury (30%) and an demoscopic poll (30%). The weighted average of the votes from the first and second evenings as well as the votes from the fourth evening produced a total ranking of all of the songs. Based on this ranking, the top fifteen entries qualified to the final on the fifth evening on 13 February. The bottom five entries from the fourth evening entered a repechage round and faced an additional public televote to determine the one entry that would be readmitted to compete in the final; the other four entries were eliminated. In the final, sixteen songs competed and the top three advanced to a second round of voting in order to select the winner. The results of both rounds of voting were determined by public televoting (40%), an expert jury (30%) and an demoscopic poll (30%). An additional competition among the performers competing in the Big Artists section occurred during the third evening where each act performed a cover of an Italian song or an international hit translated into Italian. The best cover, as determined by the equal combination of votes from a press jury and a public televote, was awarded with a prize. The eight entries competing in the Newcomers'  section were divided into four semi-final duels consisting of two songs each. Two duels took place during both the second and third evenings on 10 and 11 February. The winner of each duel, as determined by the equal combination of votes from a press jury and a public televote, advanced to the final held during the fourth evening on 12 February. During the final, the four entries competed and the winner was determined via the combination of a public televote (40%), an expert jury (30%) and an demoscopic poll (30%)."

At that time it was uncertain whether he would still host the Junos or its British counterpart, the Brits. Bell Media president Randy Lennox said in an interview with The Canadian Press that initial discussions with Russell Peters began in early November when the comedian offered to take the hosting gig if Bubl\u00e9 needed someone else to step in. Shortly after Bubl\u00e9 opted to forgo the Brit Awards hosting plans, singer Adams also began talking with Juno organizers about taking a role in the Canadian broadcast. On 9 March 2017, the Juno Awards announced that Bubl\u00e9 would be replaced by Adams and Peters."

The ceremony was held on Sunday, September 17, 2017 at the Microsoft Theater in Downtown Los Angeles, California, and was broadcast in the U.S. by CBS. The ceremony was hosted by Stephen Colbert. The 69th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards were held on September 9 and 10, and was broadcast by FXX on September 16. The nominations were announced by Anna Chlumsky and Shemar Moore on July 13, 2017. Channelwise, the freshman HBO science fiction western drama Westworld and NBC sketch comedy Saturday Night Live were the most nominated programs, each with 22 nominations. Host Stephen Colbert opened the ceremony with a song-and-dance number and a monologue that lampooned the state of the world under President Donald Trump, which The New York Times said set an anti-Trump tone for the rest of the event. Many of the further presentations and host commentary continued jokes aimed towards Trump, along with winners' speeches criticizing the President and standing behind diversity in the television field. Sean Spicer, Trump's former White House Press Secretary, made an appearance in which he parodied himself. RuPaul played a living Emmy statue in a comedic interview segment with Colbert during the ceremony. Original programming streaming television services\u2014Netflix and Hulu\u2014upended traditional broadcast television series in several categories. Netflix series earned a total of 20 Primetime Emmy Awards, following only HBO with 29 and leading NBC with 15. Hulu's The Handmaid's Tale became the first web series to win Outstanding Drama Series. Additionally, streaming television also won their first awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series (Elisabeth Moss for The Handmaid's Tale \u2013 Hulu), Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series (Alexis Bledel for The Handmaid's Tale \u2013 Hulu), Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series (Bruce Miller for The Handmaid's Tale \u2013 Hulu), Outstanding Television Movie (Black Mirror: San Junipero \u2013 Netflix), and Outstanding Writing for a Limited Series, Movie, or Dramatic Special (Charlie Brooker for Black Mirror: San Junipero \u2013 Netflix). In addition, the night saw several other historic firsts: Donald Glover became the first African-American to win Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for Atlanta. Riz Ahmed, with his win for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for The Night Of, became the first Asian to win that category as well as the first Asian male to win an acting award and first South Asian to win a lead acting award. Moreover, Ahmed and Dave Chappelle also became the first Muslims to win acting awards, with Ahmed being the first Muslim to win a lead acting award and Chappelle the first to win for a guest role for Saturday Night Live. With Aziz Ansari and Lena Waithe winning Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series for Master of None, Waithe became the first African-American female to win that award. Finally, Julia Louis-Dreyfus won her record sixth consecutive award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for the same category for the same role in a single series as Selina Meyer on Veep; she is now tied with Cloris Leachman for the most wins as a performer. The awards ceremony drew 11.4 million viewers, on par with the previous awards ceremony, but one of the lowest viewerships for the Primetime Emmy Awards overall. Analysts attribute this to younger audiences preferring to watch clips or summaries than the entire event and to Florida markets being affected by Hurricane Irma."

        "content": "The 2017 FA Cup Final was an association football match between London rivals Arsenal and Chelsea on 27 May 2017 at Wembley Stadium in London, England. It was the 136th FA Cup final overall of English football's primary cup competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup (FA Cup), organised by the Football Association (FA).   This was a rematch of the 2002 FA Cup Final and the first final since 2003 in which the sides had won once in the Premier League against one another, with a 3\u20130 victory for Arsenal in September 2016, and a 3\u20131 win for Chelsea the following February. The game was broadcast live in the United Kingdom by both BBC and BT Sport. BBC One provided the free-to-air coverage and BT Sport 2 was the pay-TV alternative. The match was refereed by Anthony Taylor in front of a crowd of 89,472.  Arsenal kicked off and dominated the early stages, opening the scoring with a goal from Alexis S\u00e1nchez in the fourth minute. On 68 minutes, Victor Moses fell in the Arsenal penalty area under pressure and appealed for a penalty but instead was shown his second yellow card by the referee for diving and was sent off.  In the 76th minute, Diego Costa scored for Chelsea to level the score at 1\u20131: he received the ball from Willian and struck the ball past David Ospina, the Arsenal goalkeeper.  Two minutes later Aaron Ramsey scored with a header past Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois after a cross from Olivier Giroud, who had come on as a substitute less than a minute earlier, to make it 2\u20131 to Arsenal.  After four minutes of stoppage time, the whistle was blown and Arsenal won the FA Cup final 2\u20131, to secure a record 13th title, while Ars\u00e8ne Wenger became the most successful manager in the tournament's history with seven wins. Winning the FA Cup would have meant Arsenal qualified for the 2017\u201318 UEFA Europa League group stage had they not already secured their place in the competition after finishing fifth in the 2016\u201317 Premier League.  They also earned the right to play Chelsea who were the Premier League champions for the 2017 FA Community Shield."

        "content": "As a Premier League team, Arsenal started their campaign in the third round and were drawn away at EFL Championship club Preston North End.  At Deepdale, Callum Robinson put Preston ahead from close range in the seventh minute to give the home side a  lead at half-time.  A minute after the interval, Aaron Ramsey equalised with a powerful shot from the edge of the Preston penalty area before Olivier Giroud's deflected strike gave Arsenal a  victory. In the fourth round, they faced fellow Premier League side Southampton away from home at St Mary's Stadium.  Danny Welbeck scored twice before the midway point of the first half before crossing to Theo Walcott to score from close range to make it  at half-time.  Walcott completed his hat-trick in the second half, with two assists from Alexis S\u00e1nchez, and Arsenal won . In the fifth round, Arsenal were drawn away against non-League side Sutton United of the National League who were 105 places below them in the English football league system. At Sutton's Gander Green Lane, Arsenal won  with goals from Lucas P\u00e9rez and Walcott either side of half-time. The match was also noted for Sutton United's reserve goalkeeper Wayne Shaw being investigated by the Football Association and Gambling Commission:  he had eaten a pie pitchside and admitted after the match that he had known that a betting company had offered odds on him doing so. In the quarter-final, Arsenal were drawn at home at the Emirates Stadium against National League club Lincoln City.  Walcott gave Arsenal a one-goal lead in first-half stoppage time before second-half goals from Giroud, S\u00e1nchez and Ramsey, and an own goal by Luke Waterfall, gave the home side a  victory. In the semi-final which took place at Wembley Stadium as a neutral venue, they played against fellow Premier League team Manchester City.  After a goalless first half, Sergio Ag\u00fcero put Manchester City ahead on the hour mark before Nacho Monreal scored the equaliser with a volley from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross.  The match ended  in regular time and went into extra time.  In the 101st minute, S\u00e1nchez scored from close range to put Arsenal ahead, a lead which they kept for a  win and progression to the final."

The home side took the lead through Pedro, and Michy Batshuayi doubled their advantage before half-time.  Willian made it  seven minutes after the interval before John Terry was sent off for a foul on Lee Angol.  Three minutes later, Tom Nichols scored for Peterborough but Pedro scored with 15 minutes to go to make the final score . In the fourth round, they were drawn against Championship team Brentford at home.   Goals from Willian and Pedro made it  after 21 minutes, before Branislav Ivanovi\u0107's goal on the break and a penalty from Batshuayi gave Chelsea a  victory. In the fifth round, Chelsea faced Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers away at Molineux.  After a goalless first half, Pedro gave Chelsea the lead with a header midway through the second before Diego Costa secured a  win with a low strike in the 89th minute.  In the quarter-final, Chelsea were drawn at home against fellow Premier League side and FA Cup holders Manchester United.  Ander Herrera was sent off for Manchester United in the 35th minute for a second yellow card before N'Golo Kant\u00e9 scored the game's solitary goal early in the second half with a low driven shot which beat David de Gea. In the semi-final at Wembley Stadium, Chelsea took on  Tottenham Hotspur, their London rivals.  Willian gave Chelsea the lead in the fifth minute with a free kick before Harry Kane equalised with a low header.  Son Heung-min was adjudged to have fouled on Victor Moses on 43 minutes and Willian converted the subsequent penalty to give Chelsea a  half-time lead.  Dele Alli equalised from a Christian Eriksen pass early in the second half but strikes from Eden Hazard and Nemanja Mati\u0107 secured a  win for Chelsea and qualification for the final."

        "content": "Arsenal were appearing in the FA Cup final for the 20th time, and for the third time in four years. They had won the cup twelve times, and were beaten finalists seven times; most recently in 2001.  By comparison, Chelsea were making their 12th appearance in a FA Cup final. The club won the cup seven times and lost four finals. The clubs had previously met 13 times in the FA Cup. Arsenal held an advantage in those meetings, winning seven of the last eight; Chelsea won the last FA Cup tie, a  victory in April 2009. This was the second FA Cup final to feature both sides; the first was won by Arsenal in 2002. The most recent meeting between the two teams was a league encounter in February 2017, Chelsea winning by three goals to one, a result which moved them 12 points clear in first position. The victory was significant given that Chelsea had lost the reverse fixture 3\u20130 in September 2016, in what BBC journalist Phil McNulty described as a \"watershed moment\" in their season. While Arsenal struggled to build momentum throughout autumn and winter, Chelsea manager Antonio Conte's tactical switch from 4\u20133\u20133 to 3\u20134\u20133 thereafter resulted in a 13-match winning run. They won the Premier League with two matches to spare, and later set a new divisional record for the most wins (30). Arsenal ended the season in fifth place, their lowest placing under manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, missing out on UEFA Champions League football for the first time in 20 years. Wenger's future had been cast into doubt following a bad run of form in February and March, which included the team losing  on aggregate against Bayern Munich in the Champions League, the worst aggregate performance by an English club in the history of the tournament. To arrest the decline, Wenger adopted a similar tactical change to Conte, playing three defenders at the back. Arsenal went on to win eight of their last nine fixtures, but Wenger suggested his team were not favourites: \"it's quite even or maybe Chelsea are ahead, so it's a bit similar to what happened in the semi-final against Manchester City. That's part of what makes it all exciting as well.\" Of his future he said, \"It will not be my last match anyway, because I will stay, no matter what happens, in football.\" Former Arsenal player Paul Merson's evaluation was, \"Mertesacker is going to be crucial for Arsenal if he plays; he will have to play very well if Arsenal are to have any chance. If he doesn't play well then Chelsea are going to cut through Arsenal like a knife through butter.\" Conte described Wenger as one of the \"greats\" in football, and felt he would remain as Arsenal manager come the season's end. \"He has done a fantastic job. Sometimes in England I think you undervalue the achievement of qualifying for the Champions League. Only this season they haven't qualified for the Champions League,\" he continued. Conte reiterated the importance of his players keeping their focus and wanted Chelsea to \"pay great attention and focus\" to their opponents. Hazard, who was playing in his first FA Cup final, was eager to win the competition: \"For Chelsea, for such a big club like this, you need to win one, two, three trophies every season if you can. Now we have the possibility to win another trophy so all the players are ready for that. It's such a great competition for the fans.\" While Chelsea had no injury or suspension worries, Arsenal had doubts over the fitness of Petr \u010cech and Shkodran Mustafi, and were already without defenders Laurent Koscielny (suspension) and Gabriel (ankle injury). Per Mertesacker was expected to start; the Germany international only featured once for Arsenal's first team during the season.  The day before the final The Guardian reported that Wenger chose David Ospina to start in goal ahead of \u010cech. Both clubs received an allocation of approximately 28,000 tickets. For adults, these were priced \u00a345, \u00a365, \u00a385 and \u00a3115, with concessions in place. Chelsea supporters were situated in the west side of the ground, while Arsenal's were allocated in the east.  The remaining 14,000 tickets were distributed to what the FA described as the \"football family which includes volunteers representing counties, leagues, local clubs and charities\". The losing finalist would receive \u00a31.6million in total prize money while the winners earned a total of \u00a33.4million. Security at Wembley Stadium was tightened in the wake of the Manchester Arena bombing and Arsenal cancelled a screening of the game at their ground. Both clubs cancelled plans for open top bus victory parades. The game was broadcast live in the United Kingdom by both BBC and BT Sport. BBC One provided the free-to-air coverage and BT Sport 2 was the pay-TV alternative.  It was the first time in the history of the FA Cup that a spidercam was utilised during the match. Sol Campbell and Eddie Newton came onto the pitch to greet the supporters and place the trophy on a plinth. As they departed, the traditional Cup Final hymn, \"Abide with Me\" was sung by representatives of eight clubs, including Lincoln City, Guernsey, Millwall and Sutton United. The teams emerged moments later led by their managers, and players were greeted by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge. Soprano Emily Haig sang the national anthem and a minute's silence was then held to honour the victims of the Manchester attack. Prince William, Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham, and FA chairman Greg Clarke laid wreaths on the pitch in tribute."

Arsenal dominated the early stages of the match and opened the scoring with a goal from S\u00e1nchez in the fourth minute, shooting past the advancing goalkeeper from  out with his right foot. The goal was initially flagged as offside as Ramsey was adjudged as being in an offside position.  After discussion with his assistant referee, the overrode the decision and awarded Arsenal the goal due to Ramsey not attempting to play the ball.  In the tenth minute, Ramsey was shown the first yellow card of the match.  In the 15th minute, S\u00e1nchez struck from distance but his shot was high, before Costa's shot from around  was blocked by Arsenal's defence.  A minute later, Mesut \u00d6zil's side-footed shot was cleared off the line by Gary Cahill.  On 19 minutes, Arsenal hit the frame of Chelsea's goal twice in quick succession: Welbeck's header struck the post and the ball rebounded on Ramsey's chest from where it hit the post once more before going out. Midway through the half, Hazard passed to Moses whose shot was blocked before Mertesacker stopped Costa's shot.  On 29 minutes, a quick break from Arsenal ended with Welbeck opting to shoot from a narrow angle and Cahill making another goal-line clearance. Three minutes later, S\u00e1nchez's floated free kick fell to Granit Xhaka whose strike from distance was saved by Thibaut Courtois, the Chelsea goalkeeper.

Although winning the FA Cup would have secured a 2017\u201318 UEFA Europa League group stage qualification, Arsenal had already qualified for the competition with a fifth-placed finish in the 2016\u201317 Premier League, which saw them fail to qualify for the 2017\u201318 UEFA Champions League. Due to the circumstances surrounding Mertesacker's appearance, and performance on the day, some Arsenal fans and former players have dubbed the game The Mertesacker Final. Welbeck praised his team but refused to be drawn on Wenger's future, saying \"It was a great team performance... The manager is his own man and he makes his own decision and the board will make the right decision so I can't comment on that.\"   Wenger himself focused on his team's display: \"We had an outstanding performance from the first minute onwards. This team has suffered. They've united and responded.\"  Chelsea goalkeeper Courtois refused to blame Moses for the defeat: \"We are obviously disappointed but I want to say congratulations to Arsenal. They played a good game... we went down to 10 men and the red card was correct. Victor Moses doesn't need to apologise.\"  Losing manager Conte said he had been surprised by Arsenal and that his side had started poorly: \"Arsenal started very well with great determination. They surprised us a bit but I repeat our first 25 minutes weren't good... Our season was incredible to win the league in this way, it was great but now its important to look forward and to restart.\""

Then two policemen stopped me and asked me who I was with and whether I'd written anything about a helicopter into my phone, without explaining the technology of how they'd read my Notes app. After a friendly back-and-forth, they looked through my bag, checked my ID and business card and determined I wasn't a threat.

She summarized, Deadwind is \"just as compelling and addictive as its predecessors. After all, no one does brooding crime shows like the Scandinavians.\""

The ceremony was held on September 22, 2019, at the Microsoft Theater in Downtown Los Angeles, California, and was broadcast in the U.S. by Fox; it was preceded by the 71st Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards on September 14 and 15. The show did not have a host for the fourth time in its history, following the telecasts in 2003 (when the ceremony also aired on Fox), 1998 (on NBC), and 1975 (on CBS). The nominations were announced by D'Arcy Carden and Ken Jeong on July 16, 2019. Game of Thrones led the nominations with fourteen, including nine for acting and three for directing, followed by When They See Us with eleven and Barry with nine. Including its nominations at the Creative Arts Awards, Game of Thrones established a new record for most Emmy nominations received in the same year by any comedy or drama series with 32, while Pop TV received its first ever Primetime Emmy Award nominations with Schitt's Creek. For the first time in the history of the Primetime Emmy Awards, two programs originating from the United Kingdom won two of the three major awards. Fleabag won the most major awards with four including Outstanding Comedy Series, followed by Chernobyl with three including Outstanding Limited Series. Game of Thrones broke or tied several records with its wins: it became the first series in history to win Outstanding Drama Series for an eighth season and tied the record for most wins in the category with four. It also, including its Creative Arts wins, tied its own record for most Emmys won by a series in a single season, while cast member Peter Dinklage established a new record for most wins for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series with his fourth win for the series. Watched by 6.9 million viewers in the United States, it was the lowest-rated Emmy broadcast in history, amounting to a 32% drop from the 2018 ceremony."

Televised by Fox, the ceremony began with a ruse where Homer Simpson appeared in an augmented-reality stage to host the event, before an animated piano dropped from the ceiling to land on The Simpsons' character. With the event now \"host-less\", Anthony Anderson rushed on stage in a skit where he insisted that \"We\u2019re going to go without a host tonight!\" and pushed the first presenter Bryan Cranston to the stage to welcome the audience and introduce a montage of video clips. The ceremony continued in such fashion with only Lennon and montages and clips filling the time between presenters. Several winners made notable \"statement speeches\" while accepting their awards. After winning the award for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series for The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Alex Borstein said: The winner for outstanding supporting actress in a limited series or movie, Patricia Arquette (The Act), in her acceptance speech said \"I'm grateful at 50 to be getting the best parts of my life\" and paid tribute to her sister, Alexis Arquette, who had died in 2016. Michelle Williams, after winning the award for outstanding lead actress in a limited series or movie for Fosse/Verdon, made references to the gender and racial wage gaps in the film industry, as well as the Time's Up movement: In the In Memoriam presentation, a photograph of conductor Leonard Slatkin, who is alive and working in Ireland, was mistakenly used and captioned as Andr\u00e9 Previn, who died in February 2019. The telecast was watched by 6.9 million viewers in the United States, making it the lowest-rated Emmy broadcast in history, amounting to a 32% drop from the 2018 ceremony."

Gervais's comments attained mixed reactions across the political spectrum; while conservatives highly praised Gervais, journalists from liberal outlets were more critical, with Rolling Stone Rob Sheffield calling his monologue \"incredibly stale\". Of the criticism, Gervais said it was the \"best ever\", and later defended his jokes in a tweet."

Watchmen led all programs with 26 total nominations between the main ceremony and the 72nd Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, followed by The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel with 20 and Ozark and Succession with 18 each. Netflix led all networks and platforms with 160 nominations, beating the record of 137 set by HBO the previous year. Disney+, Apple TV+, and Quibi all received their first Emmy nominations and wins this year. The winners were announced on September 20. Schitt's Creek became the first series to sweep all seven comedy categories and the second to ever complete a sweep, following Angels in America as a miniseries in 2004. It also became the first Canadian program to win the overall comedy or drama series award and set a record for most Emmys for a Canadian series. Additionally, it became the first comedy series to win all four main acting categories in a single year and the first show overall to sweep the acting categories since Angels in America. Combined with its two Creative Arts Emmys, the show became the most awarded comedy in a single year with nine wins, breaking The Marvelous Mrs. Maisels record of eight from 2018 and 2019. Dan Levy won four awards for Schitt's Creek to tie Moira Demos and Amy Sherman-Palladino for the most wins for an individual in one year, while he and Eugene Levy became the first father-son duo to win Emmys in the same year. For her work on Euphoria, Zendaya became the youngest winner in the Lead Actress in a Drama Series category at 24 years old, breaking Jodie Comer's record from the previous year. She also became the second black actress to win the category, following Viola Davis in 2015. Regina King's win for her performance in Watchmen marked her fourth career Emmy, tying her with Alfre Woodard for the most wins by a black performer. Zendaya and King were also two of the seven black winners for acting in comedy, drama, or limited series, breaking the record of six. Winners are listed first, highlighted in boldface, and indicated with a double dagger (\u2021). For simplicity, producers who received nominations for program awards have been omitted."

        "content": "As part of a rotating deal among the \"Big Four\" networks signed in 2018, ABC held the rights to broadcast the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards. On January 8, 2020, during the Television Critics Association's annual winter tour, ABC announced that the ceremony would be broadcast on September 20 from the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, while the Creative Arts ceremonies would be held on September 12 and 13. However, the COVID-19 pandemic led to significant changes. The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, also known as the Television Academy, announced on June 15 that the Creative Arts ceremonies would be presented virtually due to the pandemic. Additionally, the annual Governors Ball was cancelled for the first time in its history, with the Television Academy making a $1\u00a0million donation to the Actors Fund's COVID-19 efforts in its place. The new Creative Arts dates were announced in August, with the ceremonies to be aired across five nights between September 14 and 19. On July 29, the main ceremony was moved to a remote format as well. Jimmy Kimmel was announced as the ceremony's host on June 16. This year marked his third time as host, following 2012 and 2016. Kimmel also served as an executive producer for the event. In July, Guy Carrington, Reginald Hudlin, David Jammy, and Ian Stewart were added as executive producers, with Done and Dusted producing the ceremony. Hamish Hamilton served as director for the event. While Kimmel presented the ceremony from the Staples Center, no in-person festivities (such as a red carpet or audience) at the venue took place. Celebrity guests still made on-stage appearances, including Jennifer Aniston and Anthony Anderson. The broadcast used live feeds from each nominee, with television series being represented by one of their producers. A notable exception was Schitt's Creek, whose cast and crew appeared together from a viewing party in Toronto. To maintain a high-quality presentation, the use of video-conferencing was avoided, with producers sending \"professional\" cameras to each nominee's location, as well as an operator, if they so chose. Hudlin stated that they wanted to maintain a live broadcast, while Stewart argued that \"we're not trying to make the Zoomies, we're trying to make the Emmys\". Staples Center was chosen as the venue to ensure that appropriate social distancing could be practiced among crew members, and because it could support the infrastructure needed for the large number of remote feeds that would be used (estimated to be around 140). A number of comedy gags acknowledged the pandemic and the format of the ceremony. Kimmel's opening monologue featured a laugh track and footage of audience reactions from past Emmy ceremonies. After using a clip that depicted Kimmel himself as an audience member, he revealed the empty arena, and seats with cardboard cut-outs of nominees (except for the real Jason Bateman, whom Kimmel told could stay if he promised to laugh at his jokes; Bateman left). Kimmel was also seen disinfecting the envelope for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series with Lysol spray; after Aniston commented that it was \"a little extreme\", Kimmel proceeded to throw it in a trash can and set it on fire instead. Some awards were delivered to winners via presenters in themed Hazmat suits designed to look like formalwear."

        "title": "72nd Primetime Emmy Awards_Category and rule changes",
        "content": "Several rule changes were announced in December\u00a02019. First, episodes that were scheduled to air after the eligibility period closed, known as hanging episodes, were eligible for awards if they were made available on a member-accessible platform, such as the Television Academy's streaming platform, before May 31, 2020. Otherwise, those episodes would be eligible at the following year's ceremony. For limited series, all episodes had to be made available before May 31, or the series as a whole would have to compete the following year. Other changes included the elimination of DVD screeners to save money and waste, as well as a limit on actors playing the same character across multiple series \u2013 only one performance for that character could be submitted in a given year. Programs broadcast during prime time hours as an extension of daytime series were no longer eligible, and self-published programming had to be vetted to determine if it was \"suitably competitive\". In March\u00a02020, the deadline for hanging episodes was extended to June 30 due to production delays stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic; the nomination and voting periods were similarly delayed. All shows were still required to premiere before May 31 to be eligible for the 2020 ceremony. \"For Your Consideration\" events were initially moved from live settings to virtual events due to the pandemic, but were later suspended entirely. On June 17, 2020, it was announced that the number of nominees in the Outstanding Comedy and Drama Series categories had been increased from seven to eight, regardless of the number of submissions. The number of nominees had last been increased in 2015, from six to seven. The Television Academy cited a 15% increase in submissions as the reason for the change. In other categories, a sliding scale based on the number of submissions would be used to determine the number of nominees; paired performance categories, such as supporting actor and actress in a comedy, would have the same number of nominees. The changes led to the elimination of the \"2% rule\", where submissions within two percent of the fifth-place nominee would also receive a nomination. On August 6, alongside the announcement of the Creative Arts ceremony dates, four categories were moved from the main ceremony to Creative Arts ceremonies: Directing for a Variety Series, Writing for a Variety Series, Variety Sketch Series, and Television Movie. This left 23 categories to be presented at the main ceremony. Additionally, the Governors Award was moved from its usual presentation at a Creative Arts ceremony to the main ceremony."

        "content": "The broadcast received generally positive reviews from critics. Times Judy Berman called the ceremony \"one of the most enjoyable awards shows in recent memory\" thanks not to one major decision but instead due to the many details that succeeded. She felt Kimmel's turn as host provided some energy and consistency, even as his performance was simply okay. Linda Holmes of NPR also noted that the broadcast \"wasn't just watchable; it was ... pretty good\", with the remote setup providing a level of intimacy and unpredictability missing from other awards shows. IndieWires Ben Travers called it \"a memorable, entertaining, and technically immaculate awards show\", praising the technical team and the decision to favor live speeches over recorded segments. Mike Hale of The New York Times was more critical of the ceremony, remarking that the Emmys \"continued [their] trend of feeling out of tune with the way most of us watch TV\". He added that the remote appearances and pretaped portions evoked nostalgia for \"the hothouse atmosphere and occasional breakdowns\" of live ceremonies, with spontaneity replaced by \"stage-managed banality\". Hank Stuever, writing for The Washington Post, found that the ceremony \"more than met the challenge that the pandemic handed it\" but failed to inspire any permanent ideas for changes to the awards show format. Robert Lloyd remarked in the Los Angeles Times that the show \"felt solid enough to accommodate the occasional technical difficulty\", adding that because almost everything was unprecedented, it was \"minute for minute more interesting than these long nights of self-celebration usually are\". He found that Kimmel was the right host for the event, providing \"a walking dose of normality\" to the proceedings. The ceremony was watched by 6.36\u00a0million viewers in the United States, falling below the previous year's ceremony to become the least-watched Emmys telecast in history. It achieved a 1.3 rating among adults ages 18\u201349, also a record low. The ceremony faced competition from both a NFL broadcast and, for the first time, a playoff game for the NBA. Additionally, the ceremony lacked a red carpet show leading into the ceremony, which may have affected viewership."

        "content": "Following the nomination announcement, the Television Academy was criticized for its lack of transgender nominees. Several cast members and affiliates of the FX drama Pose, which is set in New York City's LGBT ballroom scene, criticized the Television Academy for excluding its many transgender stars from the acting categories. There was similar criticism from affiliates of the HBO series Euphoria, for which transgender actress Hunter Schafer did not receive a nomination despite critical acclaim. However, despite these snubs, Rain Valdez became the second transgender person to be nominated for a Primetime Emmy for acting, receiving a nomination for Outstanding Actress in a Short Form Comedy or Drama Series. Further criticism resulted from the lack of Latino nominees. While there was a record number of black nominees, there was limited recognition for shows starring Latino casts and only one Latino or Latina nomination in any acting category (Alexis Bledel for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series). The Congressional Hispanic Caucus called the lack of nominations a \"demoralizing disappointment for the U.S.'s largest minority group\". When the Los Angeles Times reported the criticism using the terms \"Black\" and \"Latino\" separately, it was itself criticized for failing to recognize Afro-Latinos. John Leguizamo boycotted the Emmys because of its lack of Latino nominees, remarking, \"If you don't have Latin people, there's no reason for me to see it.\" Before the nominations were announced, Porter suggested that his Pose co-star Mj Rodriguez, who is transgender and Afro-Latina, was not receiving recognition because the Television Academy's members \"don't know how to adjudicate the performance\" and so simply exclude it. The Emmys also faced criticism from the Asian American community, leveled because Asian Americans only made up one percent of the nominees. The relative lack of nominations was attributed to both the small number of shows featuring Asian Americans and the perception among some voters that such shows are niche or foreign. Mindy Kaling, creator of Never Have I Ever, criticized the Emmys for not nominating the series for any Emmy categories despite its success, suggesting that it was overlooked because \"Sometimes a show like ours will always seem ethnic or niche to a certain group of people.\""

Apart from his loving parents, Ashokan is supported by his friends Ratheesh and Shaiju who stand by him through thick and thin.

Later Ashokan learns of Shyama's love for him. Despite convincing Shyama's family into marriage, the wedding is called off as Ashokan's horoscope predicts the death of his first wife. Ashokan is heartbroken. Meanwhile, Ratheesh falls in love with Rani Teacher and they get married. Ashokan consults an astrologer and seeks solutions for the problems in his horoscope. The astrologer asks him to marry a plantain so that no human will get hurt. Ashokan finds a plantain of his choice and marries it. He considers the plantain as a human wife and talks to it regularly. Later the plantain falls off and Ashokan's heart breaks. But it is then revealed that two corms from the plantain are planted again and Ashokan considers these two plantains as his kids. A new marriage proposal comes but Ashokan is reluctant to agree because he is already married. His friends make him understand the reality in vain.

        "content": "The Times of India gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and stated \"Maniyarayile Ashokan is a slice-of-life story with a genuine dose of humour.\" Behindwoods gave a rating of 2.75 out of 5 and stated \"Maniyarayile Ashokan is a simple story with a big heart, in spite of the slow narration. Watch out for Dulquer and Nazriya\u2019s surprise cameos!\" Writing for the Hindustan Times, Haricharan Pudipeddi stated \"The film, which revolves around Ashokan (Jacob Gregory) and his attempts to get married, is lighthearted and fun to watch despite its slightly predictable ending.\" The News Minute gave 3 out of 5 and stated \"The typicality of Ashokan\u2019s life, however, fades in the latter part of the film. It starts with some strange advice from a priest but goes on to affect the man all too much. Gregory easily adapts to this new character that emerges from the village guy with the government job. As with the rest of the movie, director Shamzu doesn\u2019t let this unusual part stick too much and the movie ends as sweetly as the description of the village it began with.\" Sify gave 2 out of 5 and stated \"Maniyarayile Ashokan is a below average comedy-drama which fails to impress.\" The Indian Express gave 1 out of 5 stars and stated \"Shamzu Zayba did not clearly think through the idea. The half baked plot resules in the wannabe slice-of-life movie.\" Anna M. M. Verticad of Firstpost gave the same and stated \"The confirmation of Dulquer\u2019s hotness in a cameo that he spends mostly attired in a Navy outfit is the only worthwhile takeaway from Shamzu Zayba\u2019s Maniyarayile Ashokan.\" Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion wrote \"In trying to make the proceedings \u201centertaining\u201d, the film cheats its protagonist, who remains a flat line from start to finish.\" A review from The Hindu stated \"The Malayalam film manages to make us empathise with the protagonist\u2019s plight, but one cannot miss the fact that it does become absurd and unbelievable beyond a point.\""
