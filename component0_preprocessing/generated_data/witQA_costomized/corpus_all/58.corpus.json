        "content": "Six years of hard labor in the prison jute mill has taken its toll on young Graham, convicted of manslaughter after a drunken brawl. The penitentiary's doctor and psychiatrist recommends that he be offered a change of duties before psychological damage become irreversible. When the warden recalls that it was he, as district attorney, that helped put him behind bars, he makes him his valet. Graham enjoys the change, especially the company of the warden's pretty young daughter, Mary.\nOne of Graham's cellmates tries to escape with two others but one is a stool pigeon and inadvertently gives away the plan. The guards shoot dead one escapee. Ned Galloway, Graham's other cellmate, vows to avenge this death, planning to murder the informer and warning Graham to stay away from him. However, Graham walks in on the crime. Despite finding him with the body, the warden believes that Graham is not the murderer but knows who is. Promising him parole, the warden demands the name of the killer. Graham remains loyal to the Prisoner's Code of silence so the warden sends him to \"the hole,\" hoping it will change his mind.\nMary returns from a trip and is shocked when she finds out Graham has been punished. She proclaims her love for him and urges his release. The warden promises to do so but meanwhile Captain Gleason is putting pressure on Graham to confess. Galloway is grateful that Graham has stayed true and arranges to be sent to the hole and protect him by killing Gleason, for whom he had a longstanding grudge."

Miller and Fred Niblo, Jr., son of director Fred Niblo. The original play by San Francisco Bay Area native author and playwright Martin Flavin was produced on Broadway in 1929 at the Belasco Theater. Boris Karloff, who delivered a strong performance in the stage play, is recast here as Galloway. This film accelerated his career: though appearing in dozens of pictures during the 1920s, he had mostly been cast in bit parts.\nThe Criminal Code was the first of Hawks' four collaborations with Harry Cohn, the others being Twentieth Century (1934), Only Angels Have Wings (1939) and His Girl Friday (1940). It is Hawks' only picture with Frank Fouce, who produced only five films. Hawks worked with screenwriter Seton Miller several times in the late 1920s and early 1930s. This is the only occasion he worked with Niblo, Jr. Stock footage from the film was used by Columbia in the following year's Behind the Mask, which also featured Cummings and Karloff, but in different roles."

        "content": "Though an early talkie, The Criminal Code makes a sophisticated use of sound. The intercourse is at times rapid and Hawks uses the emerging technique of overlapping dialogue.Like other prison films of the 1930s, such as San Quentin (1937) and Each Dawn I Die (1939), The Criminal Code encouraged its viewers to question the contemporary American legal and penal systems.\nHawks exploits the prison genre to illustrate the male friendship and 'group as an organic force' themes often present in his works (cf. Only Angels Have Wings, Rio Bravo, 1959). This is most apparent in the scene in which Brady starts his first day of work as warden, greeted by a prison yard full of men booing him as if they were but one man. The warden (and the camera) peer down on them from the office window.\nConstance Cummings represents the typical strong and stoic Hawksian woman. She inhabits a masculine world yet prefers to stay and live at the penitentiary."

        "content": "During the Great Depression, Godfrey Smith lives with other homeless men at a New York City dump in a Hooverville by the East River. One night, spoiled socialite Cornelia Bullock offers him $5 to be her \"forgotten man\" for a scavenger hunt. Godfrey refuses and makes Cornelia retreat and fall on a pile of ashes, much to the glee of her younger sister Irene. Godfrey finds Irene to be kind and offers to go with her to help her beat Cornelia and satisfy his curiosity regarding their scavenger hunt.\nIn the ballroom of the Waldorf-Ritz Hotel, Irene's businessman father Alexander Bullock waits resignedly, as his ditsy wife Angelica and her mooching prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Carlo play the game. Godfrey is authenticated as a \"forgotten man\", allowing Irene to win that part of the hunt. Godfrey takes the opportunity to publicly express his contempt for the players' antics before leaving in a huff. An apologetic Irene decides to make him her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and hires him as the new family butler.\nOn his first day as butler, Godfrey is warned by the Bullocks' longtime maid Molly that he is merely the latest in a long line of butlers who did not last long due to the female Bullocks' antics. Despite this, Godfrey proves to be up to the challenge, though Cornelia holds a grudge against him. Irene becomes infatuated with Godfrey. He tries unsuccessfully to discourage her. She kisses him, causing him to politely but firmly outline the boundaries of their employee-employer relationship.\nEventually, Godfrey is recognized by his longtime friend Tommy Gray at a tea party thrown by Irene. Godfrey makes up a story that he was Tommy's valet at Harvard; Tommy plays along by embellishing Godfrey's story with a nonexistent wife and five children. Upon hearing this, Irene impulsively announces her engagement to a surprised Charlie Van Rumple, but breaks down in tears and flees after being congratulated by Godfrey. Over lunch the next day, Tommy wonders what one of the elite \"Parkes of Boston\" is doing as a servant. Godfrey explains that when he lost the woman he loved, he considered suicide, but the undaunted attitude of the homeless men living at the dump rekindled his spirits.\nEventually, Irene breaks her engagement with Charlie. Cornelia attempts to seduce Godfrey on his day off, but when he rebuffs her, she plants her pearl necklace under Godfrey's mattress and calls the police to report it missing. However, the police do not find the pearls under the mattress. Mr. Bullock realizes his daughter has orchestrated the whole thing and informs her that the pearls are not insured. The Bullocks send their daughters to Europe to help Irene get over her broken engagement to Charlie, but when they return, her feelings for Godfrey have not changed. Irene stages a fainting spell and swoons into Godfrey's arms, who soon discovers she is faking it. He puts her in the shower and turns on the cold water. This, however, has an unexpected result. She says, \"Oh Godfrey, now I know you love me...You do or you wouldn't have lost your temper.\"\nGodfrey quits. Before he leaves, Mr. Bullock throws Carlo out (literally) and tells his family that his business is in dire straits and he will likely go to jail. However, Godfrey provides good news: he had realized Mr. Bullock's situation, sold short, using some of the money raised by pawning Cornelia's pearl necklace to buy up the stock that Bullock had sold. He gives the stock back to Mr. Bullock, saving the family from financial ruin. Godfrey also returns the necklace to Cornelia, who humbly expresses her gratitude and remorse for her behavior.\nWith the rest of the money Godfrey got for Cornelia's necklace, he and Tommy become business partners and converted the now-filled-in dump into a fashionable nightclub called \"The Dump\", creating new jobs for the other homeless men, with a plan to build housing for them. A determined Irene tracks Godfrey down and convinces him to marry her."

During his graduation party, he is urged to join a business dealing in plastics, the material of the future. Benjamin cringes as his parents praise him during the party, and he retreats to his bedroom, until Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's law partner, insists that he drive her home. Once there, she tries to seduce him. He initially resists her advances, but his failed attempts to connect with his parents make him feel isolated. Desperate for any kind of connection, he soon invites Mrs. Robinson to the Taft Hotel, where he registers under the pseudonym, \"Mr. Gladstone\".\nBenjamin spends the summer floating in his parents' swimming pool by day and meeting Mrs. Robinson at the hotel by night. During one of their trysts, Mrs. Robinson reveals that her loveless marriage resulted when she accidentally became pregnant with her daughter, Elaine. When Benjamin jokingly suggests that he date Elaine, Mrs. Robinson angrily forbids it. However, Benjamin's parents and Mr. Robinson, unaware of the affair, are eager for Benjamin to date Elaine, and relentlessly pester him to ask her out. Benjamin gives in, and he reluctantly takes Elaine on a date.\nWhen Benjamin sees how upset Mrs. Robinson is, he attempts to sabotage the date by ignoring Elaine, driving recklessly and taking her to a strip club. She flees the club in tears, but Benjamin, feeling remorseful, goes after her, apologizes, and kisses her. They eat at a drive-in restaurant, where they bond over their shared uncertainty about their future plans. After they visit the Taft Hotel for a late-night drink and the staff greet Benjamin as \"Mr. Gladstone\", Elaine deduces that Benjamin is having an affair with a married woman. Benjamin swears that the affair is over and makes plans for another date with Elaine for the following day.\nTo prevent Benjamin from dating Elaine, Mrs. Robinson threatens to tell Elaine about their affair. To thwart this, Benjamin reveals to Elaine that the married woman is her mother. Elaine is so upset that she throws Benjamin out of the house. Soon, she returns to school at Berkeley. Benjamin follows her to Berkeley, hoping to regain her affections. Elaine initially rejects him and briefly dates medical student Carl Smith, but then learns that her mother lied to her when she claimed Benjamin raped her, and the pair reconcile. Benjamin pushes for an early marriage, but Elaine is uncertain despite her feelings for him. Later, an angry Mr. Robinson arrives at Berkeley and confronts Benjamin in his boardinghouse room, where he informs him that he and his wife will be divorcing soon and threatens to have Benjamin locked up in prison if he continues to see Elaine. He then forces Elaine to leave college to marry Carl.\nBenjamin drives back to Pasadena and breaks into the Robinson home, searching for Elaine. Instead, he finds Mrs. Robinson, who calls the police and claims her house is being burglarized. She tells Benjamin that he cannot prevent Elaine's marriage to Carl. Before the police arrive, Benjamin flees the Robinson home and drives back to Berkeley. There, he visits Carl's fraternity and is told that the wedding will take place in Santa Barbara that day. He speeds to Santa Barbara in the Alfa Romeo he received as a graduation present from his parents. The car runs out of gas a short distance from the church. Benjamin runs to the church, arriving just as the ceremony is ending. Benjamin's desperate appearance in the glass church gallery stirs Elaine into defying her mother and fleeing the sanctuary. Benjamin fights off Mr. Robinson and repels the wedding guests by swinging a large cross, which he uses to barricade the church doors, trapping everyone inside. Benjamin and Elaine (the latter still in her wedding gown) escape aboard a bus and sit among the startled and staring passengers. As the bus drives on, their ecstatic smiles slowly fade away as they begin to ponder their uncertain future."

Bruce creates a computerized email-like system to handle the prayers but finds that the influx is far too many for him to handle, and thus sets the program to answer every prayer 'Yes' automatically.\nDuring a party celebrating his promotion, Grace discovers Bruce kissing his co-anchor, Susan Ortega, and quickly leaves. Bruce follows her and tries to use his powers to convince her to stay, but cannot influence her free will. Bruce later discovers that Buffalo has fallen into chaos due to his actions: parts of the city believe the Apocalypse is nearly upon Earth due to the meteor strikes, while a large number of people, all having prayed to win the multi-million dollar lottery and received only seventeen dollars in return, have started rioting in the streets. Bruce returns to God, learning he cannot solve all the problems and so must figure a way out on his own. Bruce thus starts helping others without divine powers, including giving Evan his job back. As he returns to his computer at home and goes about answering prayers, he finds one from Grace, wishing for his success and well-being. Another prayer from Grace immediately arrives, this one wishing not to be in love with Bruce anymore, to avoid further pain.\nRealizing his selfishness, Bruce walks alone on a highway, asking God to take back his powers and leaving his fate in his hands. Bruce is suddenly hit by a truck and meets God in the afterlife. When God asks him what he really wants, Bruce admits that he only wants to make sure Grace finds a man that would make her happy. God agrees, and Bruce is finally resurrected from the dead and taken to the hospital, where his doctors help him recover. Grace arrives at the hospital and rekindles her relationship with Bruce. Following his recovery, Bruce returns to his field reporting job and decides to take more pleasure in the simple stories."

        "content": "Finding Nemo is a 2003 American animated comedy-drama adventure film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. Directed by Andrew Stanton (in his feature directorial debut) with co-direction by Lee Unkrich, the screenplay was written by Stanton, Bob Peterson, and David Reynolds from a story by Stanton. The film stars the voices of Albert Brooks, Ellen DeGeneres, Alexander Gould, Willem Dafoe, and Geoffrey Rush. It  tells the story of an overprotective clownfish named Marlin (Brooks) who, along with a forgetful regal blue tang named Dory (DeGeneres), searches for his missing son Nemo (Gould). Along the way, Marlin learns to take risks and comes to terms with Nemo taking care of himself.\nPre-production of the film began in early 1997. The inspiration for Finding Nemo sprang from multiple experiences, going back to Stanton's childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home. To ensure that the movements of the fish in the film were believable, the animators took a crash course in fish biology and oceanography. Thomas Newman composed the score for the film.\nPremiering in Los Angeles on May 18, Finding Nemo was released in theaters in the United States on May 30, 2003. Upon its release, it received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised the visual elements, screenplay, animation, Newman's score and characters that have been cited as funny to both young moviegoers and their parents. It became the highest-grossing animated film at the time of its release, and the second-highest-grossing film of 2003, earning a total of $871 million worldwide by the end of its initial theatrical run. The film received four nominations at the 76th Academy Awards, and won the award for Best Animated Feature, becoming the first Pixar film to do so.\nFinding Nemo is the best-selling DVD title of all time, with over 40 million copies sold as of 2006, and was the highest-grossing G-rated film of all time before Pixar's own Toy Story 3 overtook it. The film was re-released in 3D in 2012. In 2008, the American Film Institute named it as the 10th greatest American animated film as part of their 10 Top 10 lists. A sequel, Finding Dory, was released in June 2016."

        "content": "Clownfish Marlin and his wife, Coral, live happily in an anemone in the Great Barrier Reef. They are about to become parents, waiting for their many eggs to hatch. The family is attacked by a hungry barracuda, knocking Marlin out. Upon waking, Marlin finds that Coral and all but one of the eggs have been eaten by the barracuda; the last remaining egg is cracked. Marlin vows to keep his only surviving child safe.\nSix years later, Marlin is now overprotective of his son, Nemo, who is starting his first day at school. During an argument over Marlin's overprotectiveness, Nemo defiantly swims to a speedboat and is captured by scuba divers. Marlin pursues the boat in vain and bumps into Dory, a blue tang with acute short-term memory loss, who offers her help. The two encounter Bruce, Anchor, and Chum, three sharks who have sworn to abstain from eating fish. Marlin finds a diver's mask that fell from the boat, accidentally hitting Dory. The scent of her blood sends Bruce into a frenzy and he accidentally sets off old naval mines that knock Marlin and Dory unconscious.\nNemo is placed in a fish tank in the office of dentist Philip Sherman in Sydney. He meets the \"Tank Gang\" led by Gill, a Moorish idol. The Tank Gang tells Nemo that he will be given to Sherman's niece, Darla, who killed her previous fish. Gill, who wishes to return to the ocean, devises an escape plan: Nemo must squeeze inside the aquarium's filter tube and block it with a pebble, obliging Sherman to put the fish into bags while he cleans the tank. This will allow them to roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo tries but fails and is almost killed.\nMarlin and Dory wake up but the mask falls into a deep trench. Swimming after it, they are attacked by an anglerfish. Dory memorizes the address on the goggles before they escape. The two take directions for East Australian Current from a school of moonfish but find themselves in a forest of jellyfish. Stung and knocked unconscious, they awaken in the East Australian Current with a large group of sea turtles, including Crush and his son, Squirt. The story of Marlin's quest is relayed by the turtles all across the ocean to Sydney, where it reaches a pelican named Nigel. Nigel tells the Tank Gang, motivating Nemo to try the pebble trick again. He successfully blocks the filter, and soon, the aquarium is covered in green algae.\nThe sea turtles take Marlin and Dory to their Sydney exit, where they get lost and are consumed by a blue whale. The whale expels them through its blowhole into Sydney Harbour. Nigel takes them to Sherman's office, where Nemo is playing dead to avoid being given to Darla. Marlin sees this just as Sherman throws Nigel out of his office. Gill helps Nemo escape through the sink drain that leads to the ocean.\nBelieving his son is dead, Marlin sadly says goodbye to Dory and leaves. Nemo meets Dory, who helps him reunite with Marlin. However, a fishing trawler captures her in a net along with a school of groupers. Nemo and Marlin work together, instructing the fish to swim down. Their combined force breaks the net, saving Dory. Upon their return home, Marlin is now more confident and outgoing, accompanied by Dory. The two see Nemo off as he leaves for school. Meanwhile, after the dentist's filter breaks, the Tank Gang escapes into Sydney Harbour in their bags. Now successfully in the ocean but still stuck in the bags, they ponder what to do next."

Forced to wait until the parks department locates the fountain, Mitch and Dave have to pose as each other.\nAt Dave's law office, Mitch befriends Dave's assistant Sabrina, but his lack of professionalism and legal knowledge sabotages an important merger with a Japanese firm.

Sabrina meets Dave at a classy restaurant and, despite only going because Mitch told her to, genuinely likes him, and they get tattoos. Dave walks her home, and she tells him to call her.\nMitch learns Dave told Jamie not to invite Mitch to their anniversary party, afraid he would ruin it.

As Dave's firm is about to agree, Mitch observes that the other representatives have not yet left, and compares the negotiations to sex and porn. He demands $725 million and has the representatives of Dave's firm begin to leave, scaring the other firm into agreement. Mitch and Dave's family then go to a gala held by the firm in honor of Dave being made partner, but Jamie is upset by the speech that praises his family values.\nDave and Sabrina are at a baseball game when a thunderstorm hits and wait it out at Mitch's house.

This relaxes Mitch enough to urinate, but their wish does not work. Security approaches, but on Mitch and Dave's third try the Galleria's lights go out, and they run.\nIn an epilogue, Dave and Mitch are thrilled to have returned to their original bodies. Mitch gets breakfast with Sabrina, not realizing the tattoo Dave got is of his face on Mitch's back, captioned \"I \u2665 Dave.\u201d Mitch speaks at his father's wedding and attends Dave's anniversary party.

        "content": "My Name Is Khan is a 2010 social drama film directed by Karan Johar and co-written by Shibani Bathija and Niranjan Iyengar. It stars Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol in lead roles, and is a co-production between India, the United Arab Emirates and China. The film narrates a fictional story where Rizwan Khan (Khan), an autistic Muslim, sets out on a journey across the United States to meet the President after Mandira Rathod Khan (Kajol), his Hindu wife, suffers from Islamophobic discrimination after the September 11 attacks. \nJohar began developing the film by 2007, seeking a departure from his previous romantic films; it is Johar's first directorial effort where he did not contribute to the screenplay. Johar and Bathija extensively researched autism in preparation for the film, especially Asperger's syndrome, as well as Islam. The film was co-produced by Johar's mother, Hiroo Yash Johar, and Khan's wife, Gauri Khan, under their respective production companies Dharma Productions and Red Chillies Entertainment. Khan and Kajol's involvement was confirmed by May 2008, with the remainder of the cast rounded out by January 2009. Principal photography began in December 2008 and lasted until October 2009, with filming locations including Los Angeles, Mumbai, and San Francisco. The film's soundtrack was composed by Shankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013Loy.\nMy Name Is Khan first premiered in the United Arab Emirates on 10 February 2010 and was theatrically released worldwide two days later by 20th Century Fox. It received widespread critical acclaim for its subject matter, direction, music, screenplay, cinematography, performances (with particular praise directed towards Khan and Kajol) and the social message. It grossed \u20b9223 crore (US$48.77 million) worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing Hindi film of 2010 and the second-highest-grossing Indian film of 2010. It received numerous awards and nominations, including three wins at the 56th Filmfare Awards. It is used as a scholarly case study for its cinematic portrayal of autism and Islamophobia."

        "content": "Rizwan Khan, a Muslim, grew up with his brother, Zakir, and his widowed mother, Razia, in a middle-class family in Borivali, Mumbai. His autism leads to special tutoring from a reclusive scholar and extra attention from his mother, all of which leads to a heightened level of jealousy from Zakir, who eventually leaves his family for a life in San Francisco. Despite this, Zakir sponsors Rizwan to come and live with him after their mother's death. Zakir's wife Haseena diagnoses Rizwan as having Asperger syndrome. Rizwan also begins to work for Zakir. He meets a Hindu woman Mandira Rathod and her young son Sameer, born from a previous marriage. Despite Zakir's uncertainty, they marry and live in the fictional Banville, adopting Rizwan's surname as theirs. They also live next door to the Garrick family; Mark Garrick the father is a journalist, Sam is best friends with their young son, Reese.\nThe Khans' perfect existence gets disrupted following the September 11 attacks. Mark goes to cover the war in Afghanistan but dies there. At the same time, the Khans begin to experience the post-9/11 prejudice, and Reese begins to avoid and eventually turn against Sam when Mark is killed while covering the war in Afghanistan. In turn, Sam attempts to reconcile with Reese, which one day leads to a confrontation between the two that leads to an eventual fight on a soccer field, where a bunch of older students attack Sam, despite Reese's pleas for them to stop, which falls on deaf ears. One of them kicks a football at Sam, rupturing his spleen and killing him. A grieving Mandira starts to blame Rizwan, stating that Sam died solely because of Rizwan's surname. Consequently, when Rizwan asks what he can do to help, Mandira sarcastically tells him that to be back together, he has to tell the people and President of the United States that his name is Khan and he is not a terrorist.\nRizwan, taking her seriously, thus sets out on a road trip to first meet President George W. Bush and later President-elect Barack Obama. He travels to the fictional Wilhemina, Georgia, and befriends Mama Jenny and her son Joel. While at a mosque in Los Angeles, he overhears violent rhetoric from a doctor, Faisal Rehman who is quoting religious texts, and angrily defies Faisal's statements before walking out to drop a message for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). While waiting in a crowd at UCLA to meet President Bush, he says, \"My name is Khan and I am not a terrorist!\", repeatedly. He is arrested due to misinterpretation as \"I am a terrorist.\"\nRizwan is interrogated as a terrorist suspect but is released after a media campaign by Indian student reporters Raj, Komal and Bobby Ahuja, who prove his innocence by revealing his attempts to inform the FBI about Faisal. After his release, he returns to the hurricane-hit Wilhemina to help Mama Jenny, Joel, and everyone there, attracting media attention. Reese, seeing Rizwan on TV, finally confesses to Mandira his knowledge of what happened to Sam, and reveals the identity of the boys who killed him. She informs Detective Garcia, who has been assisting her on the case, and the boys, including Reese, are arrested.\nMandira joins Rizwan in Georgia. At the moment she arrives, Rizwan is stabbed by one of Faisal Rehman's followers who accuses him of being a traitor to Islam, and is hospitalized. Rizwan survives and meets Obama, who tells him: \"Your name is Khan and you are not a terrorist\". Rizwan in turn tells that not only him, his son Sameer was not a terrorist. Obama apologizes to him for the problems that happened to them and praises Rizwan for upholding humanity."

When Iyengar had written two of the film's songs, Akhtar was approached to write the remaining but rejected the offers, citing his unwillingness to share credits. However, on Johar's persuasion, Akhtar later agreed to write one song though his name appeared not in the film's credits. My Name Is Khan features eight singers: Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, Shankar Mahadevan, Richa Sharma, Shreya Ghoshal, Adnan Sami, Shafqat Amanat Ali, Rashid Khan and Suraj Jagan. The album was released on 5 January 2010 by Sony Music. The Billboard magazine reported that it sold 150,000 units four days after its launch in India only, and proved to be a commercial success.The soundtrack of the film received positive reviews from music critics. Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama wrote My Name Is Khan's music does not has the romantic nature that is usual in Karan Johar's films, mainly Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, and gave it a rating of three out of five stars. Hindustan Times concluded, \"On the whole, every song in the album is above-average. The composers have stuck to the theme of the film and the soundtrack has the potential to rock the charts.\" Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com found the music to have strong Sufi feels, opining that \"it's neither fancy nor groundbreaking but warm enough to make us like it\". Writing for the BBC, Jaspreet Pandohar described the soundtrack as a \"mellow, spiritually-uplifting musical experience\", while Mid-Day noted \"the six-track album is worth occasional listening, but certainly not the soul-stirrer you were expecting\". The Indo-Asian News Service included \"Sajda\" in their listing of 10 greatest Bollywood songs of 2010. The songs have been listed as following."

The lyrics are penned by Niranjan Iyengar. The audio rights of the film were purchased by Sony Music Entertainment, which had also previously released music for all of Johar's past releases, which gained global musical success. The album was released on 1 January 2010. The musical soundtrack consists of 6 original songs and 4 bonus tracks that are taken from Johar's previous successful films featuring Khan. The soundtrack includes one instrumental called \"Khan Theme\", composed by Indrajit Sharma and the strings for the song are performed by the Bombay Film Orchestra. The songs such as \"Noor-e-Khuda\" blend western bar blues and techno sounds with Indian classical styles such as Sufi and Hindustani. The song \"Allah hi Rahem\" sung by Ustad Rashid Khan is another example of Sufi thematic song. The soundtrack is thus representative of the \"indie fusion genre\". Unlike all of Johar's other films, none of the songs plays in lip-sync format, instead playing in the background.Although Iyengar is alone credited for writing the lyrics for the songs, he penned the only two Sufi songs in the film, \"Sajda\" and \"Allah Hi Rahem\". Shankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013Loy's previous collaborator Javed Akhtar was approached to write the lyrics for the remaining three songs. Earlier, it was reported that Akhtar refused to write lyrics because he did not want to share credits with another lyricist. Later, Johar confirmed that Akhtar penned the remaining songs, but did not want to be credited as lyricist when the soundtrack released. Akhtar confirmed this and said, \"I don't like to share the credits. I would have got the publicity but the other person, who has done a fine job, wouldn't have. I have read the songs penned by Niranjan and I think he has done a great job.\""

The season continues the story of the Wisteria Lane residents, while their seemingly perfect lives in the suburban neighborhood are shaken by the arrival of the mysterious Betty Applewhite. Broadcast in the Sunday night time slot at 9.00 ET, the season aired twenty-four regular episodes, including a two-part season finale. In addition, three clip shows were produced for the season, in order to put the previous events of the show in perspective. \"All the Juicy Details\" aired before the eleventh episode, detailing the most memorable events of the season's first half, whereas \"The More You Know, The Juicier It Gets\", which aired before the twentieth episode, prepared the viewers for the highly anticipated season finale. \"Time to Come Clean\" aired three weeks before the inception of the third season, and reviewed the previous mysteries of the series before introducing the new story lines. The second season had fourteen roles receiving star billing, out of whom eleven were part of the first season's main cast. The main story lines of the season were Susan Mayer's relationship with her former husband, Gabrielle Solis' upcoming motherhood, Lynette Scavo's return to work and the death of Bree Van de Kamp's husband.\nThe season received mixed reviews from television critics, noting Marc Cherry's lack of involvement in the production as one of the main reasons for the series' decreasing quality. Cherry has since said that he regrets most of the second season and that ABC's decision to order an additional episode for the season forced the series to work on an abbreviated schedule. However, the main cast members, as well as the guest stars, received critical acclaim, resulting in numerous awards and nominations. The highest-rated episode of the season was the season premiere, watched by 28.36 million viewers, with a 10.1 rating, being the series' second highest-rated episode to date. Buena Vista Home Entertainment officially released the season on DVD in the United States and Canada on August 29, 2006."

Screenwriter Kevin Murphy also returned to the series, this season as a co-executive producer alongside George W. Perkins, Chris Black, Joey Murphy and John Pardee. All but Edelstein and Pardee also served as writers. Season one writers Alexandra Cunningham, Jenna Bans, Kevin Etten, and Josh Senter were joined by new series writers Bruce Zimmerman, Dahvi Waller, Alan Cross, Ellie Herman, Jim Lincoln, and Scott Sanford Tobis. Bans and Senter also became story editors. Nine directors serviced Desperate Housewives, including season one directors Larry Shaw, David Grossman and Arlene Sanford. Wendey Stanzler, Robert Duncan McNeill, Pam Thomas, Randy Zisk, Stephen Cragg, and Tom Cherones directed episodes of the series for the first time during this season. Cherry left a majority of the season's writing to other staff members, which many critics faulted as the reason for the decreasing quality of the series. Edelstein left the series after the first thirteen episodes of the season, and Spezialy followed in May 2006. Cherry has since said that he regrets most of the second season and that ABC's decision to order an additional episode for the season forced the series to work on an abbreviated schedule. Cast member Teri Hatcher has also mentioned production problems during filming for the series' second season, including incomplete or delayed scripts, whereas fellow cast members Marcia Cross, James Denton, and Felicity Huffman have all expressed concerns of the series' declining quality both with the writing staff and the press. Colonial Street, which is the location of Wisteria Lane set for the series, went through additional changes prior to production on the second season. The cul-de-sac, known as \"Circle Drive\" by crew members, was heavily remodeled. Previously unseen in first season, \"Circle Drive\" contained a church facade, which was replaced by Edie Britt's second home, and the Colonial Mansion building, which was destroyed and replaced with a park for the series.While developing storylines for the second season, series creator Marc Cherry stated, \"I want to keep finding new ways to talk about issues that relate to everyday women,\" explaining that the show needs to focus on \"small, real, everyday issues\" in order to keep the audience interested. Cherry cited the Lynette storyline as an example of this strategy: \"Lynette will be returning to her advertising roots next season, so I want to address how difficult it is to go to work all day and then come home and be expected to also take care of your house.\" Huffman recognized that her character's storylines needed a change of pace, but hoped that Lynette's domestic life would still play an integral role this season. \"My hope is to not get lost in the corporate world; that it's still a home and family/husband and children story,\" she explained. \"But how many times can you go, 'Kids, clear your plates!'\" The season premiere introduced Lynette's new boss, Nina Fletcher, portrayed by Joely Fisher who describes her character as \"nasty\", elaborating: \"Lynette suddenly has to come up against this tiger lady who never stops reminding Lynette that she's childless by choice. Even though Nina is not a housewife, she is desperate in her own way.\" Due to the death of his character, Steven Culp did not return to the series for the second season, but provided his face for the open casket scene in the season premiere, which saw the producers create a life mask of the actor. Doug Savant was promoted to series regular after appearing as a recurring guest star throughout the first season.The season saw the promotion of Alfre Woodard and Mehcad Brooks to series regulars,  after they were introduced in the final two episodes of the first season. Woodard played Betty Applewhite, a \"deeply religious, overbearing single mother\" while Mehcad portrayed her son, Matthew. In regards to the characters and their mystery storyline, Cherry stated: \"They come on the street; they seem like nice people \u2014 but they've got a secret. And it's pretty gothic. It's real and human and awful all at the same time.\" Woodard commented that her character \"never means harm... Let's just say she has flaws. She had to make some really tough decisions quick and if the law ever catches up with her, she'll have to serve time... But they'll never catch her.\" The final scene in which Betty and Matthew bring food to the prisoner in their basement was originally intended for the first-season finale but saved for \"Next\" instead. While the Applewhites are regarded as the first major black characters on the series, Cherry stated that the role of Betty was originally offered to two white film actresses, both of whom turned it down due to financial and time commitment issues. He clarified: \"There's nothing strategically black about her character. Her color is incidental.\" Woodard stated that she had never seen the show before accepting the role, something that led the producers to send her fifteen episodes of the show, which she divided amongst various family members. After they compared storylines, Woodard recalled that she became \"instantly hooked\" on the series. Woodard reported experiencing heavy media attention after accepting the role. Both Brooks and his brother, Billy, auditioned for the role of Matthew. The final decision came down to both brothers as well as two other actors. According to Cherry, Brooks was cast because he exuded a \"dangerous\" element, as well as \"a combination of this wholesome, sweet quality and a dark, brooding quality.\""

        "content": "Jean Brodie is a teacher at an all-girls school called Marcia Blaine in Edinburgh, Scotland, in the 1930s. Brodie is known for her tendency to stray from the school's curriculum, to romanticize fascist leaders like Benito Mussolini and Francisco Franco, and to believe herself to be in the prime of life. Brodie devotes her energy and attention to girls she sees as special or mouldable, who are referred to as the \"Brodie Set\". At the film's outset, the Brodie Set is composed of four 12-year-old junior school girls: Sandy, Monica, Jenny, and Mary.\nThe Brodie Set often go to art museums, theatre, and have picnics on the school lawn, to the chagrin of the school's austere headmistress Emmeline Mackay, who dislikes that the girls are cultured to the exclusion of hard knowledge, and seem precocious for their age. She has a grudge against Brodie, who has tenure and was hired six years before Mackay became headmistress. Brodie boasts to her girls that the only way she will stop teaching at Marcia Blaine is if she is assassinated.\nBrodie catches the eye of the school's music teacher and choirmaster Gordon Lowther, with whom she and the girls spend weekends at his luxurious estate in Cramond. Brodie sometimes spends the night with Lowther, although she tries to conceal this from the girls. Lowther wishes to marry Brodie, but she still has feelings for the school's art teacher Teddy Lloyd, an ex-lover of Brodie's who steadily pursues her.\nAs the Brodie Set grow older and progress closer to the Senior School, they frequent Teddy Lloyd's studio, where he paints Jenny's portrait. Sandy initially rebuffs a lecherous advance from Lloyd. However, when Brodie tries to manoeuvre Jenny and Lloyd into an affair, and Sandy into spying on them, it is Sandy, resentful of Brodie's constant praise of Jenny's beauty, who becomes Teddy's lover and muse. Sandy ends the affair because of Lloyd's continuing obsession with Brodie.\nMary, influenced by Brodie, leaves the school to join her brother, whom she believes to be fighting for Franco in the Spanish Civil War. She is killed shortly after crossing the frontier when the train she is on is attacked, which incites Sandy to inform the headmistress of Brodie's efforts to impose her politics on her students. The disclosure finally leads to Brodie's termination, her humiliation compounded by Mr. Lowther's engagement to another teacher.\nBefore Brodie's departure, Sandy confronts her about her manipulation of Mary, Mary's senseless death, and the harmful influence she exerted on other girls, adding that Mary's brother is actually fighting for the Spanish Republicans. Brodie responds with a series of harsh but astute comments about Sandy's character, particularly her ability to coldly judge and destroy others. Sandy retorts that Brodie professed to be an admirer of conquerors and walks out of the classroom, Brodie runs after her and  screams down the hallway, \"Assassin!\"\nSandy, Monica, and Jenny graduate and leave the school. As Sandy departs, her face streaked with tears, Brodie's voice is heard proclaiming her oft-repeated motto: \"Little girls, I am in the business of putting old heads on young shoulders, and all my pupils are the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me. Give me a girl at an impressionable age, and she is mine for life.\""

Vanessa Redgrave triumphed in the lead role in London, as did Zoe Caldwell in New York. Vincent Canby, reviewing the film in the New York Times, wrote \"Jay Presson Allen...created a much better play than is generally recognized. Roles like that of Miss Jean Brodie don't often write themselves\" (3 March 1969). However, some critics have questioned whether the play is a particularly faithful adaptation. They have suggested that it turned an experimental work into a realistic one and removed some theological issues, turning the final product into a story of failed love (and possibly also failed fascist politics).\nThe play reduced the number of girls in the Brodie Set from six to four (and discarded another girl not in the set), and some of them are composites of girls in the novel. Mary is a composite of the original Mary and Joyce Emily; although mainly based on the original Mary, it was Joyce Emily in the novel who died in the Spanish Civil War (Mary later dies in a fire), and rather more is made of this incident in the play than in the novel. Jenny is a composite of the original Jenny and Rose; in spite of her name she has more in common with Rose who, in the novel, Miss Brodie tried to maneuver into having an affair with Mr Lloyd.\nThe novel made extensive use of flash forward. The play largely dropped this device, but it includes a few scenes showing Sandy as a nun in later life. The film, which made a few changes from the play, discarded these scenes in favor of a linear narrative."

        "content": "Marge Simpson drops off Maggie at the Ayn Rand School for Tots, where, after going through a security screening, she is classified as being of \"average intelligence\", by a machine manufactured by \"Often-Wrong Technologies\". A guard then carries her past the \"Room for Gifted Babies\" and puts her in the \"Nothing Special\" dreary corner.  The playtime items are either taken away or eaten by the other babies.  A butterfly then makes its way into the room as Maggie's nemesis, Baby Gerald, squashes and kills it on the wall with a mallet and draws a box around it with a crayon.  A second butterfly also meets the same fate.  Maggie finds a caterpillar and a pop-up book about the life cycle of the butterfly.  Realizing that the caterpillar could also meet the fate of the first two butterflies, she tries to protect it from Gerald.  The caterpillar later encases itself in a chrysalis and starts to transform.  Once the newly formed butterfly emerges, Maggie tries to help it fly out of the window, but Gerald seemingly kills it by shutting the blinds on it as it attempts to pass through.  Maggie dramatically mourns as she falls to the floor.  Marge then arrives to pick her up, when it is revealed Maggie's scene was only a ruse to cover the truth: she had slipped her hair bow onto the windowsill and wore the butterfly on her forehead in its place.  She then sets the butterfly free as Marge drives her home."

        "content": "In 2011, The Simpsons executive producer James L. Brooks proposed the idea of making a short film and releasing it in cinemas in front of a feature film, similar to how animation film studio Pixar creates shorts to play before their feature films. \"He didn\u2019t say anything about doing it in 3D, per se, but that was sort of the idea\u2026that we would be doing it in 3D.\" He wanted the short to be a fun gift for the fans of The Simpsons, and according to the series' showrunner Al Jean, \"We [the staff] just wanted to do this as a way of saying, 'We appreciate how much people have stayed with the show and watched it for 25 years.'\" Brooks picked David Silverman, long-time veteran of the series and director of The Simpsons Movie (2007) to oversee the film. Silverman gave credit to Richard Sakai for the idea to produce the film in stereoscopic 3-D. He considered the reasoning for employing 3-D \"hard to describe,\" noting that was largely an experiment and its genesis was born out of \"having fun.\"\nThe group first gathered in March 2011\u2014consisting of Brooks, Silverman, Al Jean, David Mirkin, writers Joel Cohen and Michael Price, and Simpsons creator Matt Groening via phone\u2014to pitch ideas for a short. Early on, it was decided to keep it entirely silent and employ Maggie as the lead character, and the setting of a daycare was decided upon. Jean wrote the treatment for the film, and Silverman completed an animatic of early story reels in June 2011. By the following February, the team regrouped to structure the story and formulate more ideas. With the help of Brad Ableson, Erick Tran and Ben Lane, the storyboards and animatic for the short were approved and the film entered production. Silverman himself animated two shots present in the final film.Silverman and his crew began animation work on the short in March 2012, completing in May after just under ten weeks of production. He considered his crew \"very experienced\", noting that he worked with stereographer Eric Kurland for the 3-D shots. It was animated with The Simpsons's usual production pipeline, which involved sending shots to AKOM in South Korea, but with an amplified focus on the 3-D.  The team would attempt to complete ten scenes to send to AKOM per week, which would be returned in a cleaned-up form after two weeks. Shots were then composited together at Film Roman out of necessity as the backgrounds relied on the 3-D. Most stereo elements for 3-D were picked out after shots were cleaned up, while others were manipulated in post-production with After Effects. The short was more costly than the average episode of the television show."

Claudia Puig of USA Today argued that \"the brief tale is far more clever and whimsical than any sequence in Ice Age.\" Similarly, Sun Herald critic Leigh Paatsch said the short \"displays all the wit and creativity missing from Continental Drift.\" San Francisco Chronicle writer Amy Biancolli commented that the short is \"only a few minutes long, but those few minutes boast more imagination, pathos and suspense than the entire film that follows.\" Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote that while the short takes place in a daycare, it ironically features more \"artistic maturity\" than Continental Drift.The Longest Daycare has been praised for being both humorous and emotional. Puig and Biancolli described the short as \"hilarious\". Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic stated that the film is \"terrific\u2014sweet, sad, funny, surprising,\" and Kristian Lin of Fort Worth Weekly said it is \"clever\" and \"surprisingly moving\".  Writing for Pioneer Press, Chris Hewitt noted that Maggie's interaction with Gerald \"is hilarious and, ultimately, poignant in an animated film that covers more territory, all without dialogue, than most full-length movies.\" He went on to call the short a \"triumph of storytelling, pacing and big-hearted humor.\"A. O. Scott of The New York Times called the short a \"charming 3-D cartoon\" that is \"witty and touching and marvelously concise\". He added that it \"cleverly blends the bright-colored flatness of the television show with the gimmickry of 3-D. It also upholds (more than the TV series itself) one of the golden rules of animation: no talking.\" Tim Martain of The Mercury has also described the short as \"touching\". The Boston Globe's Tom Russo thought the short was \"a welcome throwback to the days when The Simpsons had more sentiment at its core, and wasn\u2019t so much about the latest batch of newbie Ivy League writers taking their cues from Family Guy.\" In a joint review of the episode \"Hardly Kirk-ing\", Teresa Lopez of TV fanatic said \"The Longest Daycare was a beautiful piece of animation showcasing a tender story of hope in an otherwise bleak environment. I feel like the only time The Simpsons can really exercise some creativity and depth is in these shorts and during the show's opening sequence.\""

The deal is done and Phil and Claire (Julie Bowen) want to take Cam and Mitch out for dinner as a way to thank them.\nAt the dinner, Cam feels depressed because the process of their attempt to adopt a second baby is taking too long and the solution of surrogacy does not sound good because one of them would be left out since only one could be the biological father. All four of them are drinking while they are discussing and Claire ends up offering her egg to them so they can have a half-Pritchett and half-Tucker baby.

Soon, everyone starts saying their opinion and Mitch and Claire get under the table to discuss alone in peace about what they should do.

Mary, a modernised Christian girl studying in a nearby town, returns to the village after finishing her examinations, where her wealthy brother David lives with his wife Elissy. David is ruthless, arrogant and feared by the villagers. However, he is extremely protective of his sister. Once when she sings with her friends, Vichu and his friends mock her singing skills. Feeling insulted, she decides to learn singing, obtains permission from David and enrolls in music classes under Vichu's mother.\nMary soon excels and gets the appreciation of Vichu's mother. Vichu gets impressed with Mary's perseverance and when she sings a song exceedingly well, he loses his heart to her. He starts chasing her and expresses his love. Mary, however, avoids him and goes to the extent of slapping him. But the same anger turns into love when she realises his true love for her.\nThe relationship between Vichu and Mary grows and they become very close to each other without their families knowing. Two children playing on the beach see Vichu and Mary romancing; one of them informs her mother, who in turn informs Elissy about their affair. Elissy berates Mary for courting a non-Christian and warns her of the consequences, should David learn. Elissy prevents Mary from leaving her house, instead arranging for Vichu's mother to teach her there. Vichu and Mary start exchanging messages written on paper pieces tucked in the harmonium. Despite Elissy's control, Mary manages to meet Vichu. Vichu's mother accidentally sees a note in the harmonium and cautions Vichu. However, he explains his true love and seeks her support.\nMary gets admission in a city college, but her love for Vichu prompts her to adopt ingenious techniques to fall ill to enable her to get excuses to cancel the trip. Vichu's friends say the best way to resolve the matter is by proposing formally. Vichu and his friends visit David at his house and propose Vichu's marriage with Mary; David angrily refuses, beats Mary and berates Elissy for being irresponsible. He then locks up Mary and vows to stop her love affair with Vichu.\nDuring the course of events, David gets aroused by his servant Mari's wife undressing, enters the bathroom and rapes her. Elissy who sees the whole thing is too afraid to stop David and she frantically tries to divert Mari's attention to avoid exposing David and thereby shaming her family. Though he is caught in the act, David cleanly gets away due to his clout, and Mari and his wife quietly leave the house without making a scene, after making a sarcastic comment to David that he had already 'repaid' them for their loyalty, and Elissy \u2014 rather than they \u2014 should be given the final payment for coolie services rendered, for standing 'guard' so faithfully during the shameful act.\nHurt by the barbed comment but knowing she did wrong and enraged at David's lack of remorse and callousness when she confronted him about the rape, Elissy now turns against David. She decides to help Mary, who truly loves Vichu and assists Mary to meet Vichu secretly. David, who comes to know of this, decides to get Mary married to a relative in a hurry. The priest at the local church meets David and advises him to understand true love and support the young lovers, but David disagrees as he feels religion is more important than emotions. Elissy is against his plan, and advises Mary to meet Vichu and decide their future.\nMary and Vichu decide not to run away, but to live in the same village. When they are together, David lands up, beats Vichu and his friends, takes Mary away and speeds up the process of her forced marriage. When Mary is determined to marry Vichu, Elissy takes her to Vichu's house and hands her over to his mother. Though Vichu's mother is apprehensive, she does not wish to abort their love and accepts Mary. However, David and his people arrive; Vichu's mother asks him and Mary to run away to a safer place. They both run away but remain at the beach. The night passes with protection from their friends. David meets the villagers and provokes them for allowing a Hindu to elope with a Christian. All the villagers join him and come to attack the lovers the next morning.\nVichu and Mary notice the armed crowds coming and decide to face them. An armed David comes to attack Vichu, but is stopped by the priest who advises David to be a human and respect love. David insists that as a true Christian he will not allow Mary to marry a non-Christian as long as she is Christian. In response, Vichu and Mary renounce their respective religions, much to the shock of David and the villagers, then walk away. Vichu's friends celebrate the lovers' new found happiness and peace."

It turns out, however, that Brad is in fact a millionaire's son whose family does not want him associating with the theatre. On opening night, in order to save the show when the juvenile cannot perform (due to his lumbago acting up), Brad is forced to play the lead role.\nWith the resulting publicity, Brad's brother J. Lawrence Bradford (Warren William) and family lawyer Faneuil H. Peabody (Guy Kibbee) discover what he is doing and go to New York to save him from being seduced by a \"gold digger\".\nLawrence mistakenly identifies Carol as Polly, and his heavy-handed effort to dissuade the \"cheap and vulgar\" showgirl from marrying Brad by buying her off annoys her so much that Carol plays along, but the two fall in love. Meanwhile, Trixie targets \"Fanny\" Peabody, the lawyer, as the perfect rich sap ripe for exploitation. When Lawrence finds out that Brad and the real Polly have wed, he threatens to have the marriage annulled, but relents when Carol refuses to marry him if he does. Trixie marries Faneuil. All the \"gold diggers\" end up with wealthy men."

        "content": "The film contains four song and dance sequences designed, staged and choreographed by Busby Berkeley.  All the songs were written by Harry Warren and Al Dubin.  (In the film, when producer Barney Hopkins hears Brad's music he picks up the phone and says: \"Cancel my contract with Warren and Dubin!\")\n\"We're in the Money\" is sung by Ginger Rogers accompanied by scantily-clad showgirls dancing with giant coins. Rogers sings one verse in Pig Latin. During filming, Berkeley overheard Rogers speaking in Pig Latin, and immediately decided to add a Pig Latin verse to the song.\n\"Pettin' in the Park\" is sung by Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell. It includes a tap dance from Keeler and a surreal sequence featuring dwarf actor Billy Barty as a baby who escapes from his stroller.  During the number, the women get caught in a rainstorm and go behind a backlit screen to remove their wet clothes in silhouette. They emerge in metal garments, which thwart the men's attempts to remove them, until Billy Barty gives Dick Powell a can opener.  This number was originally planned to end the film.\"The Shadow Waltz\" is sung by Powell and Keeler. It features a dance by Keeler, Rogers, and many female violinists with neon-tubed violins that glow in the dark.  Berkeley got the idea for this number from a vaudeville act he once saw \u2013 the neon on the violins was an afterthought. On March 10, the Long Beach earthquake hit while this number was being filmed:\n\n[it] caused a blackout and short-circuited some of the dancing violins. Berkeley was almost thrown from the camera boom, dangling by one hand until he could pull himself back up. He yelled for the girls, many of whom were on a 30-foot (9.1 m)-high platform, to sit down until technicians could get the soundstage doors open and let in some light.\n\"Remember My Forgotten Man\" is performed by Joan Blondell, with featured vocal solo by Etta Moten \u2013 who also dubbed Blondell's singing voice at the end of the number \u2013 and features sets influenced by German Expressionism and a gritty evocation of Depression-era poverty. Berkeley was inspired by the May 1932 war veterans' march on Washington, D.C., and FDR's speech about the \"Forgotten Man\" from the same year. When the number was finished, Jack L. Warner and Darryl F. Zanuck (the studio production head) were so impressed that they ordered it moved to the end of the film, displacing \"Pettin' in the Park\".An additional production number was filmed, but cut before release: \"I've Got to Sing a Torch Song\" was to have been sung by Ginger Rogers, but instead appears in the film sung by Dick Powell near the beginning."

        "content": "According to Sin in Soft Focus: Pre-Code Hollywood by Mark A. Vieira, Gold Diggers of 1933 was one of the first American films made and distributed with alternative footage in order to circumvent state censorship problems. Busby Berkeley, the choreographer and director of the musical numbers, used the lavish production numbers as a showcase of the female anatomy that were both \"lyrical and lewd\". \"Pettin' in the Park\" and \"We're in the Money\" are prime examples of this. The state censorship boards had become so troublesome that a number of studios began filming slightly different versions of censorable scenes. In this way, when a film was edited, the \"toned down\" reels were labeled according to district. One version could be sent to New York City, another to the South, and another to the United Kingdom.Vieira reports that the film had two different endings: in one, the rocky romance between Warren William and Joan Blondell \u2013 whom he calls \"cheap and vulgar\" \u2013 is resolved backstage after the \"Forgotten Man\" number. In an alternative ending, this scene never takes place and the film ends with the number."

Her grave is situated in Chuchura , district town of Hooghly.\n7 Khoon Maaf is an adaptation of the short story \"Susanna's Seven Husbands\" by Ruskin Bond. After Bhardwaj saw the possibility of a script in the short story, he requested Bond to develop the story for a film adaptation. Bond expanded his 4-page short story into an 80-page novella, and later Bhardwaj co-wrote the script with Matthew Robbins. The film's musical score was composed by Bhardwaj, and Gulzar wrote the lyrics. Principal photography started in Kashmir before moving to Coorg, where extensive filming was done.\n7 Khoon Maaf released on 18 February 2011 to widespread critical acclaim, with major praise directed towards Chopra's performance.

A short time later she reappeared as a widow in mourning, for her husbands' funerals.Emphasizing the film's theme, Chopra introduced a \"seven ways to lose your Valentine\" press kit for reporters at a Valentines Day promotion. The kit contained a rope, a syringe, a knife, a bottle of poison, a sachet of potassium cyanide, an ice pick and a blister pack of Viagra, which was based on Susanna's way to kill her husbands in the film.

In New York City, masked robbers, dressed in painter coveralls and using variants of the name \"Steve\" as aliases, seize control of a Manhattan bank, taking patrons and employees hostage. They divide the hostages into groups and hold them in different rooms, forcing them to don masks and coveralls identical to their own, rotating them among various rooms and occasionally inserting themselves covertly into the groups. They also take turns working on a project involving demolishing the floor in one of the bank's storage rooms.\nPolice surround the bank, and Detectives Keith Frazier and Bill Mitchell take charge of negotiations. Russell, the head robber, demands food be provided. The police send pizzas whose boxes have hidden listening devices. The bugs pick up someone speaking Albanian (initially misunderstood to be Russian), which is later identified as propaganda recordings of the late Albanian leader Enver Hoxha, implying that the robbers anticipated the attempted surveillance.\nWhen Arthur Case, the bank's founder and chairman, learns about the holdup, he hires fixer Madeleine White to try to protect the contents of a safe deposit box within the bank. Russell breaks into a safe deposit box and finds, among other things, documents from Nazi Germany. White, using her influence with the Mayor of New York, is introduced to Frazier and persuades him to let her talk to Russell, who agrees to allow her inside the bank so they can talk privately. Russell implies that Case started his bank with money he received for collaborating with the Nazis, resulting in many Jews dying during World War II. \nFrazier demands to inspect the hostages before allowing the robbers to leave and Russell shows him around the bank. As he is being shown out, Frazier attacks Russell, but is restrained by another robber. Afterwards, Frazier explains he deliberately provoked him, concluding that Russell is not a killer. However, Frazier's conclusion is almost immediately tested when a hostage execution is staged. The execution prompts an Emergency Services Unit team into action. They plan to storm the bank, using rubber bullets to knock out those inside. Frazier discovers that the robbers have planted a listening device on the police; aware of the police plans, the robbers detonate smoke grenades, remove their masks, and exit the bank hidden among the hostages.\nThe police detain and question everyone but cannot distinguish the identically dressed hostages from the robbers. A search of the bank reveals the robbers' weapons were plastic replicas. They find props showing that the hostage execution was faked, and no money or valuables appear to have been stolen. Unable to identify the suspects and unable to show a robbery has even been committed, Frazier's superior orders him to drop the case. Frazier, however, searches bank records and finds that safe deposit box No. 392 has never appeared on any records since the bank's founding in 1948. He obtains a search warrant to open it. White then confronts Frazier to persuade him to drop his investigation and during their conversation she hints at Case's Nazi dealings.  Frazier refuses to stop his investigation and plays a recording he had surreptitiously made of an incriminating conversation that took place earlier between White and Frazier. White confronts Case, who admits the box contained loose diamonds and a diamond ring he took from a Jewish friend whom he betrayed to the Nazis.\nRussell's opening monologue is revealed to have happened while he hid behind a fake wall the robbers had constructed inside the bank's supply room. He emerges a week after the robbery with the contents of Case's safe deposit box, including incriminating documents and several bags of diamonds. On his way out, he bumps into Frazier, who does not recognize him. Russell exits the bank and enters a waiting car filled with his co-conspirators, some of whom the police had questioned. When Frazier opens the safe deposit box, he finds the ring and a note from Russell that says, \"follow the ring\". He confronts Case, urging White to contact the Office of War Crimes Issues at the State Department about Case's war crimes. At home, Frazier finds a loose diamond and realizes that Russell slipped it into his pocket during their collision while exiting the bank."

Russell first appears at the beginning of the film, breaking the fourth wall and narrating in medias res of how he will commit the perfect bank robbery. Owen nearly turned down the role; like Washington, he expressed concerns over the character's disguise of a hood, mask and sunglasses. He said, \"To play whole scenes where you're masked, you've got on sunglasses and you're wearing a hood is very weird, because a lot of acting is often through intent, and intent is shown through the eyes.

I've always wanted to be involved in something he's making.\":\u200a7\u200a She described her character as a woman with \"a relaxed kind of witty quality to her.

He described Case as a \"wonderful, rich head of all sorts of organizations \u2014 I suppose a kind of 'Enron creature' \u2014 who runs banks and other world businesses.

Lee confirmed this, expressing that he could not secure funding for the project. \"Inside Man was my most successful film, but we can't get the sequel made,\" he said. \"And one thing Hollywood does well is sequels. The film's not getting made. We tried many times. It's not going to happen.\"In 2019, a sequel titled Inside Man: Most Wanted was released direct-to-video and streaming on Netflix."

        "content": "The second season of the American dramedy-mystery television series Desperate Housewives commenced airing in the United States on September 25, 2005, and concluded on May 21, 2006. The season continues the story of the Wisteria Lane residents, while their seemingly perfect lives in the suburban neighborhood are shaken by the arrival of the mysterious Betty Applewhite. Broadcast in the Sunday night time slot at 9.00 ET, the season aired twenty-four regular episodes, including a two-part season finale. In addition, three clip shows were produced for the season, in order to put the previous events of the show in perspective. \"All the Juicy Details\" aired before the eleventh episode, detailing the most memorable events of the season's first half, whereas \"The More You Know, The Juicier It Gets\", which aired before the twentieth episode, prepared the viewers for the highly anticipated season finale. \"Time to Come Clean\" aired three weeks before the inception of the third season, and reviewed the previous mysteries of the series before introducing the new story lines. The second season had fourteen roles receiving star billing, out of whom eleven were part of the first season's main cast. The main story lines of the season were Susan Mayer's relationship with her former husband, Gabrielle Solis' upcoming motherhood, Lynette Scavo's return to work and the death of Bree Van de Kamp's husband.\nThe season received mixed reviews from television critics, noting Marc Cherry's lack of involvement in the production as one of the main reasons for the series' decreasing quality. Cherry has since said that he regrets most of the second season and that ABC's decision to order an additional episode for the season forced the series to work on an abbreviated schedule. However, the main cast members, as well as the guest stars, received critical acclaim, resulting in numerous awards and nominations. The highest-rated episode of the season was the season premiere, watched by 28.36 million viewers, with a 10.1 rating, being the series' second highest-rated episode to date. Buena Vista Home Entertainment officially released the season on DVD in the United States and Canada on August 29, 2006."

        "content": "Marc Cherry, Tom Spezialy, and Michael Edelstein returned as executive producers for the second season of the series. Screenwriter Kevin Murphy also returned to the series, this season as a co-executive producer alongside George W. Perkins, Chris Black, Joey Murphy and John Pardee. All but Edelstein and Pardee also served as writers. Season one writers Alexandra Cunningham, Jenna Bans, Kevin Etten, and Josh Senter were joined by new series writers Bruce Zimmerman, Dahvi Waller, Alan Cross, Ellie Herman, Jim Lincoln, and Scott Sanford Tobis. Bans and Senter also became story editors. Nine directors serviced Desperate Housewives, including season one directors Larry Shaw, David Grossman and Arlene Sanford. Wendey Stanzler, Robert Duncan McNeill, Pam Thomas, Randy Zisk, Stephen Cragg, and Tom Cherones directed episodes of the series for the first time during this season. Cherry left a majority of the season's writing to other staff members, which many critics faulted as the reason for the decreasing quality of the series. Edelstein left the series after the first thirteen episodes of the season, and Spezialy followed in May 2006. Cherry has since said that he regrets most of the second season and that ABC's decision to order an additional episode for the season forced the series to work on an abbreviated schedule. Cast member Teri Hatcher has also mentioned production problems during filming for the series' second season, including incomplete or delayed scripts, whereas fellow cast members Marcia Cross, James Denton, and Felicity Huffman have all expressed concerns of the series' declining quality both with the writing staff and the press. Colonial Street, which is the location of Wisteria Lane set for the series, went through additional changes prior to production on the second season. The cul-de-sac, known as \"Circle Drive\" by crew members, was heavily remodeled. Previously unseen in first season, \"Circle Drive\" contained a church facade, which was replaced by Edie Britt's second home, and the Colonial Mansion building, which was destroyed and replaced with a park for the series.While developing storylines for the second season, series creator Marc Cherry stated, \"I want to keep finding new ways to talk about issues that relate to everyday women,\" explaining that the show needs to focus on \"small, real, everyday issues\" in order to keep the audience interested. Cherry cited the Lynette storyline as an example of this strategy: \"Lynette will be returning to her advertising roots next season, so I want to address how difficult it is to go to work all day and then come home and be expected to also take care of your house.\" Huffman recognized that her character's storylines needed a change of pace, but hoped that Lynette's domestic life would still play an integral role this season. \"My hope is to not get lost in the corporate world; that it's still a home and family/husband and children story,\" she explained. \"But how many times can you go, 'Kids, clear your plates!'\" The season premiere introduced Lynette's new boss, Nina Fletcher, portrayed by Joely Fisher who describes her character as \"nasty\", elaborating: \"Lynette suddenly has to come up against this tiger lady who never stops reminding Lynette that she's childless by choice. Even though Nina is not a housewife, she is desperate in her own way.\" Due to the death of his character, Steven Culp did not return to the series for the second season, but provided his face for the open casket scene in the season premiere, which saw the producers create a life mask of the actor. Doug Savant was promoted to series regular after appearing as a recurring guest star throughout the first season.The season saw the promotion of Alfre Woodard and Mehcad Brooks to series regulars,  after they were introduced in the final two episodes of the first season. Woodard played Betty Applewhite, a \"deeply religious, overbearing single mother\" while Mehcad portrayed her son, Matthew. In regards to the characters and their mystery storyline, Cherry stated: \"They come on the street; they seem like nice people \u2014 but they've got a secret. And it's pretty gothic. It's real and human and awful all at the same time.\" Woodard commented that her character \"never means harm... Let's just say she has flaws. She had to make some really tough decisions quick and if the law ever catches up with her, she'll have to serve time... But they'll never catch her.\" The final scene in which Betty and Matthew bring food to the prisoner in their basement was originally intended for the first-season finale but saved for \"Next\" instead. While the Applewhites are regarded as the first major black characters on the series, Cherry stated that the role of Betty was originally offered to two white film actresses, both of whom turned it down due to financial and time commitment issues. He clarified: \"There's nothing strategically black about her character. Her color is incidental.\" Woodard stated that she had never seen the show before accepting the role, something that led the producers to send her fifteen episodes of the show, which she divided amongst various family members. After they compared storylines, Woodard recalled that she became \"instantly hooked\" on the series. Woodard reported experiencing heavy media attention after accepting the role. Both Brooks and his brother, Billy, auditioned for the role of Matthew. The final decision came down to both brothers as well as two other actors. According to Cherry, Brooks was cast because he exuded a \"dangerous\" element, as well as \"a combination of this wholesome, sweet quality and a dark, brooding quality.\""

        "content": "In 1792, Spain suffers amid upheaval from the French Revolution. Francisco Goya is a renowned painter who does portraits as the Official Court Painter to Spain's royalty, among others.\nThe Spanish Inquisition is disturbed by some of Goya's work. Brother Lorenzo Casamares defends him and later hires him to paint his portrait.  Lorenzo says that his works are not evil, but simply depict evil. He recommends that the Church/Inquisition step up against anti-Catholic practices, and he is given power to intensify the Inquisition.\nWhile posing for Goya, Lorenzo sees a painting and asks about the model he uses, In\u00e9s, the daughter of rich merchant Tom\u00e1s Bilbat\u00faa. Later, In\u00e9s is spotted in a tavern by Holy Office spies (trained by Lorenzo) declining a dish of pork.  She is summoned by the Inquisition and arrested on charges of \"Judaizing\" by refusing pork. She is stripped naked and tortured by strappado (put to The Question) into a confession and then imprisoned.\nHer father begs Goya for help, who in turn asks Lorenzo to learn about In\u00e9s's situation. Lorenzo finds her naked in the dungeon, feigning to help her and pass a message to her family. He covers her up and offers to pray with her, but struggles with his desire for her. She prays with him at his request.\nLater, at a dinner in Bilbat\u00faa's home where he and Goya are guests, Lorenzo defends strappado (The Question). He argues that if the accused is innocent, God will give him or her the strength to deny guilt; therefore, a person who confesses under duress must be guilty. Bilbat\u00faa does not agree and argues that people will confess to anything under torture, to which Goya also agrees.\nBilbat\u00faa then draws up a document which says that Lorenzo confesses to being a monkey, and with the help of his sons, tortures Lorenzo in the same manner, causing him to break down and sign it. Bilbat\u00faa promises to destroy the document if In\u00e9s is released. He gives Lorenzo a large gold 'donation' for the Church in the hopes it may persuade the Holy Office to release her.\nLorenzo pleads for In\u00e9s, and the Inquisitor-General Father Gregorio accepts the money, but refuses her release, since she has confessed. Lorenzo again visits In\u00e9s, offering to pray with her, but instead rapes her. Later, her father brings the document to the king, Charles IV who is amused at reading it and promises to look into In\u00e9s' situation. The document is an embarrassment to the Holy Office, and Lorenzo flees when they come to arrest him. His portrait is confiscated and publicly burned in effigy.\nFifteen years pass, and a now deaf Goya is at the height of his creativity. The French army invades Spain, abolishes the Inquisition and sets the prisoners free. Lorenzo had fled to France, and is now a fanatical adherent of the French Revolution. He has become Napoleon's chief prosecutor against his Inquisition ex-colleagues. This twist in Lorenzo's allegiance may have been inspired by Juan Antonio Llorente. A French show trial court convicts and sentences the Inquisitor-General to death.\nLeft in the dungeons over the years, In\u00e9s has been losing her sanity. She gave birth to a daughter who was taken away at birth. Upon returning home and finding her family dead, In\u00e9s turns to Goya for help in finding her child. Lorenzo is the father, which is embarrassing for him, and he sends In\u00e9s to an insane asylum. Lorenzo questions the condemned Inquisitor-General, who tells him that a child born in the dungeon would've been placed at an orphanage. Lorenzo finds her and learns from the nuns that his daughter, Alicia, had run away several years prior.\nWhile sketching in Garden Park, Goya notices a prostitute named Alicia who looks just like In\u00e9s. He goes to Lorenzo and asks for In\u00e9s, so he can reunite her with her daughter. Lorenzo becomes worried and secretly visits Alicia at the park, offering to pay her passage to America if she leaves Spain. She refuses, calling him insane. Meanwhile, Goya visits the asylum where Lorenzo had stashed In\u00e9s and bribes the director to release her. He attempts to bring her to see Alicia at a tavern where prostitutes gather. As he tries to persuade Alicia, soldiers (on Lorenzo's orders) raid the place and arrest all the prostitutes. Goya learns that Lorenzo plans to sell them as slaves to America.\nSoon after, the deluded In\u00e9s wanders into the tavern and finds a baby left by its mother, who was taken in the raid. She is elated and steals the baby away thinking it is her lost child.\nThe British are easily defeating the French with help from the Spanish populace.  They come over a hill and charge the wagons transporting the prostitutes. The French escort abandons the wagons, and Alicia catches the eye of a British officer. Lorenzo is caught fleeing the invasion, and Spain has reinstated the Inquisition.  Lorenzo is sentenced to death, with the Inquisitor-General reversing their earlier roles. He urges Lorenzo to repent as he is taken to the execution wearing a sanbenito with painted flames, indicating that he is sentenced to hell.\nOn the scaffold, Lorenzo sees Alicia, next to the British officer, scoffing at him. He also sees Goya sketching the scene at a distance. In\u00e9s is also in the crowd, and she calls to Lorenzo, showing him the baby she thinks is their daughter. Refusing to repent despite pleas from his former colleagues, Lorenzo is garroted. The film ends with a cart taking Lorenzo's body away, escorted by In\u00e9s still carrying the child, with Goya following behind and calling for her. She glances back with a smile, but continues to accompany Lorenzo's body."

Forman said he wanted to depict the \"interesting fact that Napoleon brought the seeds of democracy to Spain, but at the time it wasn't enough\". Forman said the same thing was happening in Iraq: \"We are planting the right seeds in the wrong soil. This soil is not yet fertilized enough for these seeds to grow\".The film's first scene, with the priests looking at Goya's apparently scandalous work and saying \"This is how the world sees us\", could be compared to the Abu Ghraib scandal."

Prince Colwyn and Princess Lyssa plan to marry in the hope that their two kingdoms' combined forces can defeat the Beast's army. However, the Slayers attack before the wedding is completed, devastating the native Krull armies, wounding Colwyn, and  kidnapping Lyssa.\nColwyn is nursed back to health by Ynyr, the Old One. Ynyr tells Colwyn that the Beast can be defeated with the Glaive, an ancient, magical, five-pointed weapon resembling a large  throwing star. Colwyn retrieves the Glaive from a mountain cave, and sets out to find the Black Fortress, which teleports to a new location every sunrise. As they travel, Colwyn and Ynyr are joined by the  magician Ergo \"the Magnificent\" and a band of nine thieves and fighters: Torquil, Kegan, Rhun, Oswyn, Bardolph, Menno, Darro, Nennog, and Quain. The cyclops Rell later joins the group.\nColwyn's group travels to the home of the Emerald Seer and his apprentice, Titch. The Emerald Seer uses a  crystal to view where the Fortress will teleport next, but the Beast remotely crushes the crystal with magic. The group travels to a swamp that the Beast's magic cannot penetrate, but Darro is lost to a Slayer attack, and Menno to  quicksand. A  changeling agent of the Beast kills the Emerald Seer and assumes its victim\u2019s form, but the agent is discovered and killed by Rell and Colwyn.\nAnother changeling is instructed by the Beast to seduce Colwyn. This is meant to convince Lyssa that Colwyn does not love her. However, he rejects the changeling's advances, and Lyssa \u2013 witnessing this through a vision provided by the Beast \u2013 affirms that love triumphs over might. The Beast, though, forces her to consider marrying him so that he will halt the Slayers\u2019 attacks.\nYnyr leaves the group to seek the Widow of the Web: an enchantress who loved Ynyr long ago and was exiled to the lair of the Crystal Spider for murdering their only child. The Widow reveals where the Black Fortress will be at sunrise. She also gives Ynyr the sand of an enchanted hourglass to keep the Crystal Spider at bay and the injured Ynyr alive. As the Crystal Spider attacks the Widow, Ynyr returns to the group to reveal the location of the Black Fortress. As he speaks, he loses the last of the sand and dies.\nThe group captures and rides magical Fire Mares to reach the Black Fortress. The Slayers at the Fortress kill Rhun, while Rell sacrifices himself to hold open the crushing spaceship doors long enough to allow the others to enter. Quain, Nennog, and Kegan are killed as they make their way through the fortress. Ergo transforms into a tiger to save Titch from a Slayers' attack. Colwyn, Torquil, Bardolph, and Oswyn are trapped inside a large dome. The latter three fall through an opening and are trapped between walls studded with huge spikes, which kill Bardolph.\nColwyn breaches the dome and finds Lyssa. He attacks the Beast with the Glaive, which becomes embedded in the Beast's body. With nothing to defend themselves, Lyssa and Colwyn quickly finish their wedding ritual. This gives them the power to manipulate fire, with which Colwyn slays the Beast. The Beast's death frees Torquil and Oswyn, and they rejoin Colwyn, Lyssa, Ergo and Titch.

        "content": "The film score was composed by James Horner and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and the Ambrosian Singers. It has been commended as part of the composer's best early efforts. The soundtrack is considered a high point of the film. Ryan Lambie, reviewing for Den of Geek wrote, \"The 70s and 80s seemed to be the era of great sci-fi and fantasy themes, and Horner's is high up on the list of the best, providing the film a grandiose sweep to match the broad vistas of Krull's location photography.\"The score features traditional swashbuckling fanfares, an overtly rapturous love theme, and other musical elements that were characteristic of fantasy and adventure films of the 1980s, along with incorporating avant-garde techniques with string instruments to represent some of the monstrous creatures. Additionally, to accompany the main antagonists, the Beast and its army of Slayers, Horner utilised Holst-like rhythms and groaning and moaning vocals from the choir. Also of note is a recurring \"siren call\" performed by female voices that starts and bookends the score, and appears numerous times in the story to represent the legacy of the ancient world of Krull.Horner's score is reminiscent of earlier works, particularly Battle Beyond the Stars and Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Some segments would be used for the ambiance of the Disneyland Paris attraction Space Mountain: Mission 2.The score has been released numerous times on album by various labels. The first was a 45-minute condensed edition released by Southern Cross Records in 1987, featuring most of the major action cues, three renditions of the love theme, and the music from the end credits; however, music from the main title sequence was omitted. Southern Cross Records later released special editions in 1992 and 1994 (the latter a Gold disc), expanding on the previously released tracks, featuring the main title music and other action cues.\nIn 1998, Super Tracks released the complete recorded score in a two-CD set with elaborate packaging and extensive liner notes by David Hirsch. In 2010, La-La Land Records re-issued the Super Tracks album, with two bonus cues and new liner notes by Jeff Bond in a limited edition of 3,000 copies, which sold out within less than a year.

        "content": "Combining elements of sword and sorcery and the space opera genre, Krull has a plot compared by critics to the works in the series of Star Wars,:\u200a74\u200a The Lord of the Rings, and, for its use of the Glaive, the legend of King Arthur.:\u200a74\u200a Watt-Evans explained that the Glaive is \"just there, waiting for the right man to come and wield it\". Though most of the characters say they know about the myths of the Glaive, they never reveal these stories to Colwyn before he obtains the weapon. He wrote, \"Do any of the stories ever bother to explain who forged Excalibur, or how? No, it's just there, waiting for Arthur to come and get it. Similarly, the Glaive is just there, waiting for Colwyn.\":\u200a74\u200aWatt-Evans analogized the look, story, and vibe of Krull as a superior version of The Dark Crystal (1982).:\u200a76\u200a He described the film's settings:\n\nBasically medieval in appearance, Krull has a sort of streamlined look in places, as if perhaps its civilization is more technologically advanced than it appears on the surface. The Black Fortress and everything connected with it has a broken, vaguely organic look to it, as if it were grown instead of built \u2013 and then cut to shape where it hadn't grown right. The interior is quite weird, and seems to be constantly shifting to suit the whims of the Beast.:\u200a76\u200a\nYates's concept for Krull was \"sort of a fairy storybook that moves; a fairy tale with a life, a reality of its own. I very much wanted to make a movie with some old-fashioned romance to it, yet a movie where things always moved.\":\u200a52\u200a Watt-Evans, categorizing Krull as a fairy tale, noted the film to be mythic to the point of making \"no attempt at realism\". He analyzed, \"Lyssa and Colwyn, despite having apparently arranged the marriage for political reasons, fall madly in love at first sight.\":\u200a74\u200a He continued, \"although we're told that the Slayers have been burning villages, we never see a village, burned or otherwise.\" He wrote that establishing shots of castles show no residents or plot-unrelated extras passing by; this was an indication that the lands of Krull do not have an economic system or population, which was appropriate given that \"it's traditional for the heroes of fairy tales to be unbothered by such necessities as food and shelter.\":\u200a74\u200a He wrote that not much about the background of the characters is revealed because \"this is not a film that explores the innermost secrets of the human heart, it's a glorious fairy tale for both adults and children.\":\u200a76\u200aNone of the characters who live on Krull explain the magical powers they use every day. Watt-Evans wrote that this lack of explanation \"helps one to accept that these people are real people, living in a real world\". He reasoned that magic powers are Krull's equivalent of automobiles: \"in a movie set on Earth, does anyone bother to explain cars? No, they're just there. For Krull, magic is as much a part of the everyday world as automobiles are for us.\":\u200a75\u200aJustin K. Thompson, director of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, revealed that the spider in the web scene was an influence on the design of the spider in Go Home Machine, which is also named after the character Ynyr."

The two-part story was filmed from November 2010 to January 2011, mainly at Caerphilly Castle. The Gangers were achieved with the aid of prosthetics, as well as computer-generated imagery for their contortions. \"The Almost People\" also features a Flesh double of the Doctor, which marked Smith's first time in prosthetic make-up.

They meet a military unit led by Group Captain Gilmore and Sergeant Smith, tracking abnormal local magnetic fluctuations, originating mainly from Coal Hill School where a transmat device in its basement is tied to a Dalek ship in geostationary orbit. A second, weaker fluctuation is emitted by a nearby Dalek. There are two Dalek factions: Imperial Daleks on the orbiting mothership, controlling the school, and Renegade Daleks, who reject the Emperor's authority, controlling the junkyard. Both sides seek the Hand of Omega, a Time Lord device the Doctor left on Earth during his first visit to 1963.\nSmith is a secret associate of Ratcliffe, leader of a group of fascists, reporting to a Renegade battle computer, which uses a schoolgirl as its eyes and ears. The Doctor has the Hand buried in a local cemetery, but Ratcliffe finds it, tipped off by Smith. Imperial Daleks arrive to seize it from the Renegades, but the Doctor and Ace defeat them and destroy their transmat. Anticipating a siege, the Doctor has Gilmore fortify the school while he disables the Renegade \"time controller\",  fleeing with Daleks in pursuit, returning to the school just as the Imperial Daleks land. The Imperials eventually defeat the Renegades after deploying a Special Weapons Dalek, wiping out all but a Supreme Dalek, allowing Ratcliffe and Smith to escape with the controller, pursued by the schoolgirl, who kills Ratcliffe.\nThe Imperial Daleks take the Hand to the mothership, leaving for their home planet, Skaro. Ace follows Smith to recover the controller. The Doctor establishes communication with the Dalek Emperor, who is really their creator, Davros, who means to destroy the Time Lords with the Hand. The Doctor mocks him but then feigns fear. Davros launches the Hand, Skaro's sun goes supernova, and Skaro is destroyed, the force of the explosion also wrecking the mothership. The Hand returns to Gallifrey.\nSmith captures and attempts to kill Ace, but the schoolgirl finds them and kills Smith first. The Doctor persuades the Supreme Dalek to relinquish control of the girl. The Supreme Dalek self-destructs, and the girl screams and faints, but is unharmed. At Smith's funeral, Ace asks the Doctor if what they have done was good, to which he responds: \"Time will tell\"."

He also noted that the many continuity references in the story displayed a knowledge of the series' history, but that Remembrance of the Daleks was \"neither a celebration of the Doctor Who legacy\" like The Five Doctors (1983), \"nor an exercise in fan-obsessive continuity\" as was displayed in Attack of the Cybermen (1985).The battle between Dalek factions has been likened to racism, which is apparent in the 1960s setting as Ace sees a sign that says \"No Coloureds\". The subtext was intentional, as Aaronovitch drew on the Daleks' Nazi theme and applied it to the setting. Cartmel was particularly proud of the scene and, when it was screened to BBC Head of Drama Mark Shivas, rewound the tape because Shivas had missed the sequence due to a phone call. Shivas felt that Ace should have torn the sign up, and Cartmel agreed it was a missed opportunity."

Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote in The Discontinuity Guide, \"The best Doctor Who story in some considerable time, Remembrance of the Daleks reintroduced mystery and magic into the series with much intelligence and revisionist continuity\". The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn, despite noting that the production had not aged well visually, called Remembrance of the Daleks \"the Seventh Doctor era at its best\". He was positive towards how going back to An Unearthly Child allowed Aaronovitch and Cartmel to \"showcase their new, more devious master-planner version of the Doctor\", as well as the action and the character moments for Ace. DVD Talk's J. Doyle Wallis, reviewing the original DVD release, gave the story three and a half out of five stars, calling it \"a good ... adventure\" and noting the shift in the Doctor's personality. Alasdair Wilkins of io9 called Remembrance \"by a pretty wide margin the best anniversary special the show has ever done\", praising the return to the 1960s and the various continuity references.Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times praised the serial for \"attempting to honour the programme's roots, even if, sadly, the effect is more of the present clomping all over the past\", and questioned how the Doctor could have known about the Daleks in 1963 if he did not meet them until he left. He was also critical of the supporting characters and McCoy and Ace; he felt McCoy \"struggles to convey gravitas\" in the changes that had been made to his character, and while Aldred brought \"gusto\", Ace was \"a peculiarly safe, middle-class rendering of a streetwise kid\". Mulkern wrote that the action scenes were handled well, but some of the Daleks looked \"fragile\" and destroying Skaro was double genocide. John Sinnot, reviewing the second DVD release on DVD Talk, gave the serial three and a half out of five stars. He praised the action, references, and the Doctor's active involvement in the plot, but criticised the music and also questioned how the Doctor would have been able to plant the Hand of Omega for the Daleks. Sinnot also felt the Daleks acted \"stupid\" in some scenes, and wrote that the relationship between Ace and Mike was \"clumsy and awkward\". In 2010, Charlie Jane Anders of io9 listed the cliffhanger to the first episode \u2013 in which the Dalek levitates up the stairs \u2013 as one of the greatest cliffhangers in the history of Doctor Who. However, Anders felt that the execution was \"pants, with Sylvester McCoy pulling some dreadful faces\". In 2013, Den of Geek's Andrew Blair selected Remembrance of the Daleks as one of the ten Doctor Who stories that would make great musicals.In the Doctor Who Magazine 1988 season poll, Remembrance of the Daleks was voted as the best story of season twenty-five with 64% of the vote, 46% ahead of The Greatest Show in the Galaxy. Ten years later, the magazine conducted a poll of readers to find the most popular Doctor Who stories of all time for the programme's 35th anniversary; Remembrance of the Daleks was voted 6th. In 2003, the magazine conducted a poll for the programme's 40th anniversary \u2013 this time, Remembrance of the Daleks finished 7th. Remembrance of the Daleks placed 14th in the magazine's 2009 \"Mighty 200\" reader survey, which ranked the 200 Doctor Who stories made up to that point. In the magazine's 50th anniversary poll, released in 2014, it placed 10th. In 2023, the story finished in 9th position in the magazine's 60th anniversary poll.The 2021 Channel 4 drama It's a Sin contains a mocked-up scene of a fictional Doctor Who serial involving a Dalek attack in tribute to the actor Dursley McLinden, who appeared in Remembrance of the Daleks and whose life and early death from AIDS partially inspired the drama's main character played by Olly Alexander."

Unknown to them, the sculpture is from the goddess 'Araromire' which bestows seven years of good luck on anyone who encounters it, and after the seven years have expired, seven years of bad luck follow. The lives of the two friends begin to change for good, as they become successful and wealthy businessmen. However, after seven years, things start to change for the worse.The original idea for a thriller film came long ago from Kunle Afolayan himself and Jovi Babs and it was to be titled Shrine. The script took nine months to be finalized and the development stage took five years. The film was shot in Lagos and Osun States for three months and received sponsorship from companies such as MicCom Golf Resort, GSK, Omatek Computers, MTN, IRS Airlines, and Cinekraft. It also had media partners like HiTV and others. There were no professional stunts on the ground, so most of the stunts were performed by Kunle Afolayan on set.\nThe film was first released at the 2009 Rotterdam International Film Festival and was met with widespread critical acclaim. It received ten nominations and won five awards at the 6th Africa Movie Academy Awards, including the awards for Best Picture, Heart of Africa, Achievement in Cinematography and Achievement in Visual Effects. On 31 July 2014, A book titled Auteuring Nollywood: Critical Perspectives on The Figurine, detailing scholarly analysis of events in the film was released.

        "content": "The film opens in Araromire in 1908: There is an old folktale about a goddess Araromire who asked a priest to invoke her spirit into a figurine carved out of the bark of a cursed tree. When villagers of Araromire touched the figurine, Araromire would grant them wealth and prosperity in all their endeavours. This good fortune however unfortunately lasted for just seven years, after which everything deteriorated and became worse than it was seven years ago. The climax of the disaster was when the priest who invoked her spirit was found dead at the river. The villagers become infuriated and invaded the Araromire shrine; the shrine is burned down and that ended the evil of Araromire.\nLagos, 2001: Femi (Ramsey Nouah) is about to go for his NYSC; He has been posted to Araromire \u2013 at this time, his father (David J. Oserwe) has been very ill (it is later revealed in the movie that he was dying of cancer).\nSola (Kunle Afolayan) attends a job interview and apparently, he has no NYSC, He has also graduated with a third class. He is told he can't be employed without an NYSC certificate, so Sola visits the Dean of his faculty to get his clearance for NYSC. The Dean recognizes him as an irresponsible student who rarely attended his lectures. He further tells him that he used to date Mona who is on the contrary: a brilliant girl. The Dean asks him where he has been posted to; \"Araromire\", he replied. The Dean picks interest and brings out a book. He starts to narrate the folk story about the village and the goddess it was named after. However, Sola fails to listen to rest of the tale (the disaster which follows the seven years) as he politely leaves the dean's office with disinterest.\nFemi and Mona (Omoni Oboli) meet at the car park - She has been posted to Araromire as well; it is revealed here that they were once close friends. They both board a bus headed for Araromire. While in the bus, Mona is asleep and Femi brings out a ring; he stares at the ring and cuddles it while he stares at sleeping Mona. He is also seen cuddling the ring later at the camp.\nSola finally arrives at the NYSC orientation camp when the camp is almost over. While at the camp, out on an endurance trek, Femi becomes drained and he stops in the woods to use his inhaler as he is an asthmatic patient. Sola also waits behind to help him out. While in the jungle, they begin to hear a strange sound which always comes up during camo parade. They both start to trace the sound and later discover a strange object on top of a tree that is emitting the sound. Rain starts to fall and they both find shelter in a mud house. Sola uses his lighter and starts to explore the place. The rain has stopped and Femi moves out of the building to get fresh air. Sola finds a figurine enclosed in a dusty wooden cradle. On the last day of Parade, Mona informs Femi that Sola proposed to her and she accepted. She also stated that she's carrying his baby. Femi seems jealous and tries to discourage Sola from getting married, but Sola declines. Sola brings out the figurine he found in the mud house and drops it on Femi's lap. Femi gets back from the NYSC only to see his father hale and hearty. He is also selected to go for a special training at his work place within just six months of his appointment. Sola gets a job as well and marries Mona.\nSeven years later, Femi arrives from abroad and attends Sola's 'get-together'. Mona (who is pregnant again) introduces Femi to Linda (Funlola Aofiyebi), a fashion designer. Throughout the party, Femi pays no attention to her and keeps staring at Mona whom he is apparently still in love with. Lara (Tosin Sido), Femi's younger sister, now lives with Sola's family as Mona is helping her with her thesis. However, The Araromire figurine is still kept at Sola's. Femi's asthma has been cured miraculously as he smoked at the party.\nMona gets to know about the Araromire legend and she is worried; she begins to make conclusions and starts doubting the real source of the sudden wealth of the family. She also deduces that it may be the reason why her marriage with Sola has been so flawless, despite Sola having been a rascal and a Casanova back in school. She asks Lara to throw the figurine away but it returns into the house mysteriously. She then decides to throw it into the lagoon herself, she loses her pregnancy on her way to the lagoon. While dancing at the club with Linda, Femi gets an asthma attack again after so many years. Sola also starts having an affair with Ngozi again after so many years of being faithful to Mona, it is later discovered that he is having an affair with Lara as well and he also had an affair with Linda. Femi arrives at his apartment one day and sees his father dead in his crafts workshop. Both Femi and Sola eventually lose their jobs. Femi raises the topic of the figurine and suggests that they return it to the shrine; though Sola still doesn't believe the figurine is responsible for all the misfortune, he agrees. Junior (Tobe Oboli), Sola's first son, also dies by falling off from the building while trying to reach out to his mother \u2014 his father was having a big argument with his mum and the figurine was burnt. However, the figurine returns again. Then, Sola and Femi set out to return the figurine.\nMona, now in depression, sends Lara out of her house believing she let her son die (she was supposed to be with him at the time Junior had the accident). Lara's box opens up while she's struggling with Linda who is throwing her things out and also pushing her out of the compound. Many Figurines; similar to the one in Sola's study start to fall out of Lara's box. Apparently, she has been responsible for 'the return of the figurine' each time it was thrown out! She's called in and she starts to make confessions revealing that She is being controlled by her brother, Femi. Femi and Sola arrive at the Araromire Shrine to return the figurine; rain starts to fall and Femi is nowhere to be found. While Sola is busy looking for Femi, Femi kills him by hitting him with a log of wood. Femi returns to Lagos and he is confronted by Linda, whom Lara has already confessed to. Femi confirms the truth by revealing many things which proves that the whole Araromire good luck and bad luck was all a charade orchestrated by him in order to kill Sola and get Mona all to himself. He terms the losing of their jobs, his father's death and his asthma 'coincidence'. He kills Linda afterwards and dumps her body in the lagoon. On his way back, he has his asthma attack and commands Lara to bring him his inhaler, but she refuses; instead, she calls the 'Rapid Response Squad' to report her brother's killings. Femi struggles to get upstairs. He reaches out to the body of Mona, he removes Sola's ring from her finger and replaces it with his ring (which he was always staring at earlier). The Rapid Response Squad arrives and declares Femi dead.\nLinda, Femi and Mona are later seen alive and the movie ends with the caption 'What do you believe'?"

Mona eventually marries Sola after getting pregnant for him. Oboli stated that she likes Kunle Afolayan as a director and she wishes to learn a lot from him as she's hoping to become a director herself. She also stated that it was stressful on set as she was shooting with her real son (Tobe Oboli), so she had to take care of her son and shield him from likes of Kunle and Ramsey who would want to talk about \"adult stuff\" on set. According to her, the scene where she was dragged down the stairs was the most difficult as it was shot over and over and she got a lot of bruises as a result.\nKunle Afolayan as Sola, an unserious Casanova who finds a mystical Araromire while serving as a youth corps and takes it home.

He threatens Fat Face Rick and takes his gun, which he uses to wound a Stanfield soldier before setting fire to one of Marlo's cash pickups. Marlo increases the bounty on Omar's head, suspends the meetings of the New Day Co-Op, and ups the wholesale drug price for its members. A wary Slim Charles declines Marlo's offer for control of the Baltimore County territories, which are instead given to Cheese. At the Baltimore Sun, Templeton's reporting on the \"serial killer\" gets national attention, leading editors Whiting and Klebanow to ask for a follow-up article. Templeton spends the night under the Jones Falls Expressway and interviews Terry, a homeless Iraq War veteran with PTSD. Gus is pleasantly surprised with the high quality of Templeton's piece, but remains skeptical of his reporting overall. He asks Templeton to pursue a report from Fletcher of a complaint on Templeton's story about a woman who died from seafood poisoning. When Templeton claims the complaint was false, Gus takes his word at face value, but remains suspicious.\nMcNulty realizes that Templeton made up a few details of his own about the killer. Bunk, thoroughly disgusted with McNulty's behavior, dives back into the old murder cases tied to Marlo's crew. He decides to interview Randy Wagstaff, who remains in his group home, but he refuses to cooperate. Greggs tells Bunk that an informant implicated Marlo's crew for her triple homicide. They learn that evidence from the vacant murders has become irrevocably jumbled due to human error. Bunk then investigates the killing of Bug's father and interviews Michael's mother. While there, she implies Chris and Snoop were the killers, leaving Bunk surprised. He is given a folder of stolen grand jury indictments found in Proposition Joe's shop. Meanwhile, Mayor Carcetti hosts a ribbon-cutting ceremony for portside condos while being heckled by ex-dockworkers, including Nick Sobotka. Later, Carcetti gives a press conference vowing to protect the homeless from the \"serial killer.\" Wilson and Steinhorf suggest that running on defending the homeless may be Carcetti's key to getting elected governor. Daniels hands the stolen indictments to Pearlman and Bond, who realize there is a leak in the courthouse.  Bond also makes clear that he will be handling the Clay Davis trial alone (with the implication being that he wants to ensure that the spotlight shines solely on himself), and that he wants to remove some witnesses from the trial list.\nJudge Daniel Phelan declines McNulty and Pearlman's request for a wiretap on the Sun's phones. Freamon reveals his illegal wiretap of Marlo to Sydnor, who agrees to help. He determines that Marlo is sending photos, but a new wiretap authorization is needed to see what is being sent. McNulty finds that, with police now arriving on the scene immediately whenever a homeless person turns up dead, he is unable to stage more serial murders. He comes across a mentally ill homeless man named Larry and, with Freamon's help, photographs him with the \"killer\"'s trademark ribbon, after which Larry will never be seen again; the killer, according to the cover story, will now only send photos of his victims to the press, and their bodies will not be found. McNulty gives Larry $100 and drives him down to a homeless shelter in Richmond, Virginia, giving him a stolen ID card. As he leaves, he feels a pang of guilt over what he has done to Larry."

Although the title is adapted from Ian Fleming's 1960 short story \"From a View to a Kill\", the film has an entirely original screenplay. In A View to a Kill, Bond is pitted against Max Zorin (played by Christopher Walken), who plans to destroy California's Silicon Valley.\nThe film was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, who also wrote the screenplay with Richard Maibaum. It was the third James Bond film to be directed by John Glen, and the last to feature Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny.\nDespite receiving mixed reviews from critics, who frequently took umbrage with the effects of Moore's advanced age on his performance, and being disliked by Moore himself, it was a commercial success, with the Duran Duran theme song \"A View to a Kill\" performing well in the charts, becoming the only Bond theme song to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and earning a Golden Globe nomination for Best Song."

Q analyzes the microchip, establishing it to be a copy of one designed to withstand an electromagnetic pulse, made by government contractor Zorin Industries. Bond visits Ascot Racecourse to observe the company's owner, Max Zorin. Sir Godfrey Tibbett, a racehorse trainer and MI6 agent, believes Zorin's horses, which win consistently, are drugged, although tests proved negative. Through Tibbett, Bond meets with French private detective Achille Aubergine, who informs Bond that Zorin is holding a horse sale later in the month. During their dinner at the Eiffel Tower, Aubergine is assassinated by Zorin's bodyguard May Day, who subsequently escapes.\nBond and Tibbett travel to Zorin's estate for the horse sale. Bond is puzzled by a woman who rebuffs him; he discovers Zorin has written her a cheque for $5 million. That night, Bond and Tibbett infiltrate Zorin's laboratory, where he is implanting adrenaline-releasing devices in his horses. Zorin identifies Bond as an agent, has May Day assassinate Tibbett, and attempts to have Bond killed. General Gogol of the KGB confronts Zorin for trying to kill Bond without permission, revealing that Zorin was initially trained and financed by the KGB, but has now gone rogue. Later, Zorin unveils to a group of investors his plan to destroy Silicon Valley, which will give him and the potential investors a monopoly over microchip manufacture.\nBond travels to San Francisco and meets with CIA agent Chuck Lee, who says Zorin is the product of medical experimentation with steroids performed by Dr. Carl Mortner, a Nazi scientist who is now Zorin's veterinarian and racehorse-breeding consultant. Bond then investigates a nearby oil rig owned by Zorin, and while there finds KGB agent Pola Ivanova recording conversations and her partner placing explosives on the rig. Ivanova's partner Klottoff is caught and killed, but Ivanova and Bond escape. Later Ivanova takes the recording, but finds that Bond had switched tapes.\nBond tracks down State Geologist Stacey Sutton, the woman Zorin attempted to pay off, and discovers that Zorin is trying to buy her family oil business. The two travel to San Francisco City Hall to check Zorin's submitted plans. Having been alerted to their presence, Zorin kills the Chief Geologist, and sets fire to the building to frame Bond for the murder and kill him. Bond and Stacey flee from the police in a fire engine.\nInfiltrating Zorin's mine, Bond and Stacey discover his plot to detonate explosives beneath the lakes along the Hayward and San Andreas faults, which will cause them to flood and submerge Silicon Valley. A larger bomb is also in the mine to destroy a \"geological lock\" that prevents the two faults from moving simultaneously. Once in place, Zorin and his security chief Scarpine flood the mine and kill the workers. Stacey escapes while Bond fights May Day; after realising Zorin abandoned her, she helps Bond remove the larger bomb, putting the device onto a handcar and riding it out of the mine, where it explodes and kills her.\nEscaping in his airship with Scarpine and Mortner, Zorin abducts Stacey while Bond grabs hold of the airship's mooring rope. Zorin tries to knock him off, but Bond moors the airship to the framework of the Golden Gate Bridge. Stacey attacks Zorin to save Bond, and in the fracas, Mortner and Scarpine are temporarily knocked out. Stacey flees and joins Bond out on the bridge, but Zorin follows them out with an ax. The ensuing fight between Zorin and Bond culminates with Zorin falling to his death. Mortner attempts to kill Bond with dynamite, but Bond cuts the airship free, causing Mortner to drop the dynamite in the cabin, blowing up the airship and killing himself and Scarpine. Later, Gogol awards Bond the Order of Lenin for foiling Zorin's scheme."

Broccoli initially wanted to rehire George MacDonald Fraser from Octopussy to co-write the screenplay but he was unavailable. Originally Maibaum's script included Zorin manipulating Halley's Comet into crashing into Silicon Valley, but Wilson insisted on a more realistic plot. At the end of Octopussy, the \"James Bond Will Return\" sequence listed the next film as \"From a View to a Kill\", the name of the original short story, but later the title was changed. When a company with a name similar to Zorin (the Zoran Corporation) was discovered in the United States, a disclaimer was added to the start of the film affirming that Zorin was not related to any real-life company. This is the first Bond film to have a disclaimer (The Living Daylights had a disclaimer about the use of the Red Cross)."

The British premiere was held on 12 June 1985 at the Odeon Leicester Square cinema in London. It achieved a box office gross of US$152.4 million worldwide. In the United Kingdom, the film grossed \u00a38.1 million ($13.6 million). On its opening weekend in the US and Canada it grossed $13.3 million from 1,583 theaters over the four-day Memorial Day weekend, the biggest opening for a Bond film ever at the time, but not enough to beat Rambo: First Blood Part II which was number one for the weekend with a gross of $25.2 million from 2,074 theaters. It went on to gross $50.3 million in the United States and Canada. Other large international grosses include $11.7 million in Germany, $9.1 million in Japan and $8.2 million in France.Although its box office reception was excellent, the film's critical response was mostly mixed. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 38% based on reviews from 61 critics, which is the lowest rating for the Eon-produced Bond films on the website. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Absurd even by Bond standards, A View to a Kill is weighted down by campy jokes and a noticeable lack of energy.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 40% based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".One of the most common criticisms was that Roger Moore was 57 at the time of filming\u2014and that he had visibly aged in the two years that had passed since Octopussy. Washington Post critic Paul Attanasio said, \"Moore isn't just long in the tooth\u2014he's got tusks, and what looks like an eye job has given him the pie-eyed blankness of a zombie. He's not believable anymore in the action sequences, even less so in the romantic scenes\u2014it's like watching women fall all over Gabby Hayes.\" Sean Connery declared that \"Bond should be played by an actor 35, 33 years old. I'm too old. Roger's too old, too!\" In a December 2007 interview, Roger Moore remarked, \"I was only about four hundred years too old for the part.\"Moore also said that, at the time, A View to a Kill was his least favourite Bond film, and mentioned that he was mortified to find out that he was older than his female co-star's mother. He was quoted as saying, \"I was horrified on the last Bond I did. Whole slews of sequences where Christopher Walken was machine-gunning hundreds of people. I said 'That wasn't Bond, those weren't Bond films.' It stopped being what they were all about. You didn't dwell on the blood and the brains spewing all over the place\".Pauline Kael of The New Yorker said, \"The James Bond series has had its bummers, but nothing before in the class of A View to a Kill. You go to a Bond picture expecting some style or, at least, some flash, some lift; you don't expect the dumb police-car crashes you get here. You do see some ingenious daredevil feats, but they're crowded together and, the way they're set up, they don't give you the irresponsible, giddy tingle you're hoping for.\" Kael also singled out the dispirited direction and the hopeless script. \"Director John Glen stages the slaughter scenes so apathetically that the picture itself seems dissociated. (I don't think I've ever seen another movie in which race horses were mistreated and the director failed to work up any indignation. If Glen has any emotions about what he puts on the screen, he keeps them to himself.)\"However, not all reviews were negative. Lawrence O'Toole of Maclean's believed it was one of the series' best entries. \"Of all the modern formulas in the movie industry, the James Bond series is among the most pleasurable and durable. Lavish with their budgets, the producers also bring a great deal of craft, wit and a sense of fun to the films. Agent 007 is like an old friend who an audience meets for drinks every two years or so; he regales them with tall tales, winking all the time. The 14th and newest Bond epic, A View to a Kill, is an especially satisfying encounter. Opening with a breathtaking ski chase in Siberia, A View to a Kill is the fastest Bond picture yet. Its pace has the precision of a Swiss watch and the momentum of a greyhound on the track. There is a spectacular chase up and down the Eiffel Tower and through Paris streets, which Bond finishes in a severed car on just two wheels. But none of the action prepares the viewer for the heart-stopping climax with Zorin's dirigible tangled in the cables on top of San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge.\" And although O'Toole believed that Moore was showing his age in the role, \"there are plenty of tunes left in his violin. James Bond is still a virtuoso, with a licence to thrill.\"Brian J. Arthurs of The Beach Reporter, however, said it was the worst film of the Bond series. Chris Peachment of the Time Out Film Guide said, \"Grace Jones is badly wasted.\" Norman Wilner of MSN also chose it as the worst Bond film, while IGN picked it as the fourth-worst, while Entertainment Weekly ranked it as the fifth-worst.Danny Peary had mixed feelings about A View to a Kill but was generally complimentary: \"Despite what reviewers automatically reported, [Moore] looks trimmer and more energetic than in some of the previous efforts ... I wish Bond had a few more of his famous gadgets on hand, but his action scenes are exciting and some of the stunt work is spectacular. Walken's the first Bond villain who is not so much an evil person as a crazed neurotic. I find him more memorable than some of the more recent Bond foes ... Unfortunately, the filmmakers \u2013 who ruined villain Jaws by making him a nice guy in Moonraker \u2013 make the mistake of switching May Day at the end from Bond's nemesis to his accomplice, depriving us of a slam-bang fight to the finish between the two (I suppose gentleman Bond isn't allowed to kill women, even a monster like May Day) ... [The film] lacks the flamboyance of earlier Bond films, and has a terrible slapstick chase sequence in San Francisco, but overall it's fast-paced, fairly enjoyable, and a worthy entry in the series.\"Also among the more positive reviews was Movie Freaks 365's Kyle Bell: \"Good ol' Roger gave it his best. ... Whether you can get past the absurdity of the storyline, you can't really deny that it has stunning stunt work and lots of action. It's an entertaining movie that could have been better.\" Walken was also praised by online critic Christopher Null for portraying a \"classic Bond villain\". Bond historian John Brosnan believed A View to a Kill was Moore's best Bond entry. He said Moore looked in better shape than the previous Bond film, Octopussy. Brosnan, an airship enthusiast, especially admired the dirigible finale.Neil Gaiman reviewed A View to a Kill for Imagine magazine, and stated that \"When Grace Jones went to bed with Moore, I was sure the producers had hit upon a way to kill the old fellow off with dignity, but when Bond was seen wandering around fresh as a daisy the next morning I realised how escapist this all is. Unless he just rolled over and went to sleep, of course, which is what I was strongly tempted to do.\"Roberts was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award as Worst Actress, but she lost the trophy to Linda Blair, who appeared in Night Patrol, Savage Island and Savage Streets."

It depicts parkour in several stunt sequences completed without wires or computer-generated imagery. Because of this, some film critics drew comparisons to the Thai film Ong-Bak. David Belle plays Le\u00efto, the story's main character. This is the final film which released during Tony D'Amario's lifetime (who played as K2 in the film), before his death in 2005."

        "content": "In 2010, social problems have overrun the poorer suburbs of Paris. Especially Banlieue 13, commonly referred to as B13: a ghetto with a population of two million people. Unable to control B13, the authorities surround the entire area with a high wall topped by barbed tape, forcing the inhabitants within to survive without education, proper utilities or police protection. Police checkpoints stop anybody going in or out. Three years later, the district has become overrun with gangs. Le\u00efto is a fighter of such gangs, who disposes of a case of drugs down a drain, then escapes the gang led by K2, an enforcer who has come to collect the drugs.\nThe gang's leader, a ruthless man named Taha Ben Mahmoud, is angered and executes three of K2's men until K2 suggests they kidnap Le\u00efto's sister Lola in retaliation. Lola is captured by K2 at a supermarket. Le\u00efto is able to rescue her and take Taha to the police station, but the police chief in charge betrays and arrests Le\u00efto, saying they are leaving the district and are not willing to stand up to the gangs. Taha leaves with Lola. Despite the chief saying sorry, Leito is angered by the excuses and kills the chief out of frustration by breaking his neck.\n6 months later, Damien Tomaso, an undercover officer, completes a successful operation at an underground casino in Paris (led by Carlos Montoya), single-handedly taking down or gunning down the casino's guards and arresting the pit boss. His next assignment is briefed by Kruger, a government official. Taha's gang has taken a bomb from a nuclear transport vehicle and accidentally activated it, giving it 24 hours before it wipes out the district. Posing as a prisoner, Damien infiltrates the district to disarm the bomb. Le\u00efto immediately sees through Damien's cover, but the two reluctantly team up to save Le\u00efto's sister as well. The pair surrenders to Taha in order to gain access to his base, where they find the bomb has been set up on a missile launcher aimed at Paris, with Lola handcuffed to it.\nTaha demands a high ransom to deactivate the bomb; the government refuses. After Damien gives them Taha's bank account codes, they drain his funds. Le\u00efto and Damien escape. K2 and his men soon realize that with Taha unable to pay them, they are free from his grasp. Taha attempts to command K2 as a last resort, but K2, fed up with Taha's brutality, turns his back on his former boss and allows his men to gun down Taha. K2 takes over the gang and goes to find Leito and Damien. After a footchase K2 catches up with Leito and Damien but calls a truce and allows Leito and Damien to disarm the bomb.\nLeito and Damien reach the bomb but are forced to fight a large man named Yeti who was planted by Taha to guard the bomb. After they defeat Yeti, Damien calls Kruger to receive the deactivation code. After hearing Kruger ask if the \"bomb is in the exact spot\" and recognizing \"B13\" in the code's last characters, Le\u00efto deduces that the government has framed them, and the code will actually detonate the bomb instead of deactivating it. Damien refuses to believe that the government has set him up, and he fights Leito as Damien truly believes that he is doing the right thing to disarm the bomb, but Lola is able to restrain Damien long enough for the timer on the bomb to run out.\nThe bomb does not explode, proving Le\u00efto right. K2 and his gang allow Leito and Damien to leave the district. The pair return to the government building with the bomb and use it to force Kruger to admit that he had planned to blow up B13 as a means to end its existence, catching it on camera and broadcasting nationally. Soon, the rest of the government promises to tear down the containment wall and bring back schools and police to B13. Le\u00efto and Damien depart as friends, and Lola kisses Damien, encouraging him to visit B13."

The website's critical consensus reads, \"A nonstop thrill ride, District B13's dizzying action sequences more than make up for any expository flaws.\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100 based on reviews from 28 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".In France, reviews were slightly less positive. The main issues discussed by the French critics were the similarity with both Escape from New York and Ong Bak, and the shallowness of the plot. Lisa Nesselson of Variety noted the comparison, but said, although the narrative is derivative it \"rarely feels that way thanks to bullet pacing, nifty choreography and a few well-placed rejoinders\" and also called it \"fast, dumb fun\". Nathan Lee of The New York Times said that the director \"hasn't reinvented this particular wheel, but he gets it spinning with delirious savoir-faire.\"Several other critics also praised the film's action scenes and stunt work. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \"By most standards, District B13 is a fairly routine summer action movie, albeit one in French. But what makes it unique are the truly amazing and kinetic action scenes featuring Parkour pioneer Belle and co-star Cyril Raffaelli.\" Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe remarked, \"Like its stunt work, the movie is both ridiculously hyperactive and a muscular feat of absolute confidence. I don't expect to have a more adrenalizing time at the movies this summer.\""

Fearful and suspicious of anyone, he has with him a precious \"symbol\" to be absolutely hidden from the eyes of the curious, a white dove locked in a cage. During a stop on the train, a gust of wind takes away his hat where he has hidden all his money: he goes down to retrieve it, but his sudden departure separates him from the rest of the delegation. The hat with the money is recovered by Mario, an aspiring sacristan accompanied by a priest in the convent, who chases it in vain to try to return it: thanks to a ride in the car, he ends up in Venice but finds himself lost and alone. Having met Marisa, a beautiful flower girl whom he soon falls in love with, he involuntarily frees the dove, symbol of peace in Piazza San Marco, which flies away with the pigeons and seeks help in the party's city headquarters. Due to various misunderstandings, he is chased first by a fanatic Communist and then by a fervent republican. Refugee in the house of the relatives of the flower girl, his mild nature soon leads him into trouble: after having attended a wedding dinner he finds himself in the house of a count where he is coveted by an aristocrat. Discovered by Marisa, he is soon forgiven, but the three of the delegation discover him and, considering him a traitor, they pursue him to bring him back to his homeland. Boris, in the throes of nightmares, is therefore forced to make a decision, which will be the most obvious one: he will stay in Italy with the girl."

The series takes place in the fictional seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, in which the residents are actually characters from various fairy tales that were transported to the \"real world\" town by a powerful curse. In this episode, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) becomes upset when told by Archie (Raphael Sbarge) that his fairy tale theories are delusions; Henry places himself in danger when he investigates a mysterious sinkhole, forcing a regretful Archie to save him. Meanwhile, the backstory of Jiminy Cricket (Sbarge) is revealed \u2013 he yearns to leave his con artist parents and become a good person, but accidentally hurts an innocent couple along the way.\nIt was the first Once Upon a Time episode to be written by consulting producer Jane Espenson, while being directed by Paul Edwards. Espenson was \"thrilled\" to be assigned the episode; Jiminy Cricket was typically a character that appeared in other people's stories, so she was eager to explore him in his own narrative. Espenson especially wanted to depict how some, like Jiminy in this episode, \"have their adolescence well after adolescence. It took Jiminy a long time to figure out how to get away from the life he was living, and I think a lot of people feel like that.\" In addition, the episode contained several cultural references to the television series Lost and the Disney film One Hundred and One Dalmatians.\n\"That Still Small Voice\" first aired in the United States on November 27, 2011, with the network ABC. An estimated 10.7 million viewers watched the episode, helping it finish in third place for its timeslot. \"That Still Small Voice\" finished in fourteenth place for the week among the major networks. Since then, it has garnered generally positive critical reviews. Many praised Espenson's screenwriting, as well as Jiminy's characterization and the performances of Sbarge and Robert Carlyle."

        "content": "\"That Still Small Voice\" was the first Once Upon a Time episode written by consulting producer Jane Espenson. She was drawn to join the series because she believed a curse involving fairy tale characters was a \"fantastic concept\". She explained, \"What's the modern take on Jiminy Cricket and Rumpelstiltskin? What would their issues be in the real world? The beauty of the production, the care and the effort and, honestly, the expense that was put into it just made clear that was a project done with a lot of attention and love.\" The episode was directed by Lost veteran Paul Edwards. \"That Still Small Voice\", featuring Jiminy Cricket, was assigned to Espenson, and she was \"thrilled to get it,\" as she wanted to explore the character in his own story. She elaborated that Jiminy is Someone who you might think of as being part of someone else\u2019s story \u2013 even in Pinocchio, he\u2019s all about someone else\u2019s arc. I like taking that character and reminding us all that everyone is the hero of their own story. I related to him because of that, and also because it was such an identifiable story \u2014 the way so many people have their adolescence well after adolescence. It took Jiminy a long time to figure out how to get away from the life he was living, and I think a lot of people feel like that.\nActor Raphael Sbarge became attracted to join the series because he would effectively be helping tell two stories, one in a fantasy world and the other in a modern setting. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Sbarge compared Once Upon a Time to the television series Lost \"in that they have a large ensemble and what they do is that they take a few characters and they kind of take them, effectively on a deep dive.\" When Sbarge read the script for \"That Still Small Voice\", he was worried about \"treading into people's imaginations,\" but ultimately decided that \"they cast me for a reason because there are some qualities in me that they obviously recognize for the story they want to tell.\"Believing that his character was \"sort of a surrogate father figure\" to Henry, Sbarge admitted that the script \"made me weep because what they came up with is so lovely and magical and delightful.\" Referring to his character's storyline as a hero's journey, Sbarge said the intention was to show that Jiminy Cricket did not just begin as a noble guy \u2013 \"what you get to see on this trip are the fire rings he had to walk through to get to a place where he could evolve to develop a sense of doing the right thing.\" The episode featured guest stars Harry Groener and Carolyn Hennesy as Jiminy's parents Martin and Myrna. Groener had previously worked with Espenson in the third season of the fantasy television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is their only appearances in the series.The episode contains several cultural references and allusions. The scenes in which Henry was carrying a couple of Apollo Chocolate Candy Bars in his back pack was also the same brand of candy bars made by the DHARMA Initiative on Lost, while Archie's pet Pongo is also the name of one of the dogs in the Disney film One Hundred and One Dalmatians.The episode's title, \"That Still Small Voice\", is an apparent allusion, or reference to a Biblical passage in the Books of Kings: \"but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.\""

As a solution, Oswald compresses his car with his hands until it is hand-sized. The rabbit drops the tiny vehicle in his shorts and gives the bellhop a raspberry before proceeding to the club's entrance.\nComing to the night club also was a large wolf. Holding onto the wolf's garments is his cub who refuses to separate from him. Frustrated by the persistent holding, the wolf puts his offspring inside large pajamas and hangs it on a light post.\nThe wolf cub was able to come out of the pajamas but was saddened upon losing sight of his father. He came to the night club's entrance and asked \"Is my father in there?\" A voice from inside tells him not to stay by the doors. The wolf cub would ask the same question to a number of people but would never get the answer he wanted.\nInside the night club, the patrons are dancing as the musicians play the tune Alexander's Ragtime Band. Everyone appears to be having a pleasant time, especially Oswald who stands on a chair, rocking it back and forth. The next event features four dogs in tuxedos who sing part of the song Sweet Adeline on stage, but their performance wasn't well received by the guests.\nStill enjoying the atmosphere nonetheless, Oswald dances on his table. Sitting by and sharing his table is the large wolf. As he dances, the rabbit accidentally kicks the wolf in the nose, much to the latter's disturbance. The wolf then grabs Oswald's head and rips it off his body. Miraculously, Oswald survives and is able to put himself back together. As retribution, Oswald throws a jar on the wolf's head.\nWhile the wolf tries to take the jar off his head, a cow laughs at him. As a response, the wolf kicks the cow, who in turn, gets laughed at by a mouse. The cow spits at the mouse who then gets laughed at by an elephant. The mouse pulls the elephant's trunk and lets go, causing that animal to trample on the other guests. As a result, everyone gets into a fist fight. Some patrons were able to flee but the rest remained in the trouble. A police car arrives at the scene and takes the whole night club building away.\nKnowing his father is still inside, the wolf cub tries to follow the moving building but cannot keep up. As he stops, he comes across an opaque telephone booth at a park. The wolf cub asks his question but only receives silence. Desperate, the little wolf rips open the booth to find a Tibetan man making a phone call inside."

While drilling underground, the extreme heat emanating from the magma around the Mole knocks the duo out and makes them temporarily lose control over where the machine is taking them. After it passes through the magma crust and gets closer to the Earth's core, the temperature inside the Mole starts to lower, and the duo regains consciousness. Perry and Innes eventually reach a surface where they can safely get out. The two notice they are in a strange land filled with the flora and fauna of prehistoric times. They are eventually captured by the Sagoths, ape-like creatures, who aim to enslave every human tribe there. The Sagoths are themselves ruled by a species of telepathic flying reptiles, the Mahars (Pterodactyls with parrot-like beaks).\nThe Mahars have the power of mind control. David falls for the enslaved Princess Dia. She is eventually chosen as a sacrificial victim in the Mahar city, while David is put to work in the magma mines and Perry visits the library. Worried about Dia, David incites a riot within the mine and is captured with Ra, another rebellious slave. The two are sent to the arena where a crowd of slaves watch. The Mahars send a giant dinosaur to kill the duo, but with the help of Perry (who shouts about the creature's weak point from the crowd), David and Ra survive. They not only kill the dinosaur but an attacking Mahar as well, earning the respect of the slaves. David and Ra must rally the surviving human slaves to rebel and win their freedom. To achieve this, Innes, Ra and Dia organise the oppressed tribes and help them work together while Perry teaches them how to construct and use bows and arrows.\nTogether, the humans manage to kill the Mahars and subdue their minions. After repairing the Mole, Perry and Innes prepare to go back to the surface with Dia. However, despite how much Dia loves Innes, she believes she will not fit in the surface world, like Innes does not fit in her own world. A hurt Innes accepts her reasoning and decides to return alone with Perry to the United Kingdom.\nHowever, a miscalculation results in the Iron Mole resurfacing outside the White House, much to the shock of two policemen standing guard there."

It made a profit.Amongst contemporary critics, however, The New York Times was not impressed: \"All the money used to make 'At the Earth's Core' seems to have been spent on building monsters with parrotlike beaks that open, close, and emit a steady squawling as if someone were vacuuming next door. Close up, the monsters look like sections of rough concrete wall and the decision to film them in closeup is only one example of the total lack of talent or effort with which the picture is made...the movie is a kind of no-talent competition in which the acting, the script, the direction and the camera-work vie for last place.\" More recently, in more positive vein, BFI Screenonline said, \"Extravagant, colourful and thoroughly preposterous, At the Earth's Core is utterly without pretension but has the exuberant charm of the best of its decade.\"The film was featured in the season finale of the revived Mystery Science Theater 3000, the show's eleventh season overall, released on April 14, 2017, through Netflix."

        "content": "\"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\" is the second episode of the third season of the American animated television series The Simpsons. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 26, 1991. In the episode, Lisa wins a patriotic essay contest about the United States. She and her family attend the contest finals in Washington, D.C., where she is dismayed after watching a congressman accept a bribe. Lisa loses the contest when she pens a scathing screed condemning the government system, but the corrupt congressman is jailed and removed from office, restoring her faith in government.\nThe episode was written by George Meyer and directed by Wes Archer. It was the first episode for which Al Jean and Mike Reiss served as show runners. It features multiple references to the 1939 film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, including the scene in which Lisa appeals to Lincoln's statue at the Lincoln Memorial for advice. Other Washington landmarks referenced in the episode include the White House, the Watergate Hotel, the Jefferson Memorial, the Washington Monument, the National Air and Space Museum and the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\nThe episode acquired a Nielsen rating of 12.9, and was the third highest-rated show on Fox the week it aired. It received mostly positive reviews from television critics, who praised the episode for its satire on American politics. The timber industry criticized the scene in which Lisa witnesses a timber industry lobbyist offering a bribe to the congressman to allow loggers to raze the Springfield Forest. The scene was described as \"an easy shot at hard-working people whose only crime is to have been born in a timber town\"."

At a shrine to a feminist icon, she sees a corrupt congressman, Bob Arnold, taking a bribe from a timber industry lobbyist to allow loggers to clearcut Springfield Forest. Heartbroken and disillusioned by government corruption, Lisa destroys her winning essay. She pens a scathing indictment, \"Cesspool on the Potomac\", which condemns government greed and corruption and names the politician involved in the bribery.\nLisa's essay elicits a hostile reaction from the judges and the audience. When word of her speech quickly spreads through the capital, Congressman Arnold is arrested, removed from office and sent to prison, where he becomes a born-again Christian. Lisa's essay fails to win the contest, but her faith in government is restored and the contest winner commends her courage and honesty."

        "content": "The episode was written by George Meyer. It is one of The Simpsons creator Matt Groening's favorite episodes of the earlier seasons because he thought it took the show to another level. Meyer said he has a \"deep suspicion of social institutions and tradition in general,\" which affected the way he wrote the episode. Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had written for The Simpsons since the start of the show, took over as show runners for the third season. Their first episode as show runners was \"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\" and they felt a lot of pressure about running the show. Jean and Reiss were so pressured that they did six to seven rewrites of the script to make it funnier. Jean said \"one reason for doing all these rewrites is because I kept thinking 'It's not good enough. It's not good enough',\" and Reiss added that \"we were definitely scared. We had never run anything before, and they dumped us on this.\"Wes Archer directed \"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\", which was one of the first episodes to feature the Simpson family traveling to a real-life location. Because much of the episode takes place outside of Springfield, new background and character designs had to be animated. The Simpson family visits several real-life landmarks in Washington, which the animators were able to draw with the help of photographs from the animation studio's library. The Simpsons director David Silverman grew up in the Washington area so he was able to help out with the designs. Marge's voice actor, Julie Kavner, said she loved the charm of the family \"just being on a trip and experiencing the hotel room they're staying at, and the integrity of Bart's character. You know, you just want to kill him for doing all those tricks and pranks.\" Jean believes this is one of the secrets of the show's success, the fact that it is about a family and the writers can use experiences from their own or their family's life as an inspiration in their writing. He thought \"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\" was a perfectly constructed episode in that sense. This episode also featured the debut of George H.W. Bush (the then-incumbent U.S. president), voiced by Harry Shearer, who would reappear as a recurring character throughout the years most notably in the season 7 episode \"Two Bad Neighbors\"."

        "content": "The title and plot of the episode are parodies of the 1939 film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, in which the character Jefferson Smith comes to Washington with patriotic enthusiasm, but is instead shocked to see evidence of corruption in the government. The Tampa Tribune's Curtis Ross called this reference one of the best film references in The Simpsons' history. Lisa's visit to the Lincoln Memorial is a direct reference to Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, in which Smith appeals to Lincoln's statue for inspiration like Lisa did in the episode. In his book Abraham Lincoln in the Post-Heroic Era, Barry Schwartz writes that the scene with Lisa at the crowded monument shows how \"thoroughly Lincoln's moral and emotional significance has waned\". Mark Reinhart writes in the book Abraham Lincoln on Screen that the scene sums up \"with brilliant wit\" the American society's \"annoying and ultimately useless tendency to ask [themselves] 'What would Lincoln have done?' whenever [they] face a political or social dilemma\". Mr. Smith Goes to Washington was once again referenced on The Simpsons in the season fourteen episode \"Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington\".\nIn addition to the Lincoln Memorial, other Washington, D.C. landmarks visited include the Jefferson Memorial, the Watergate Hotel (where the family stays), the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the White House, the National Air and Space Museum, and the Washington Monument. When the family visits the White House, they encounter then-First Lady Barbara Bush in the bathtub of one of the many bathrooms. Another American landmark mentioned in the episode is Mount Rushmore. In addition, Lisa proposes that the family attend the memorial of the fictional Winifred Beecher Howe, an early crusader for women's rights who later appeared on the unpopular 75-cent coins, according to Lisa. This is a reference to the Susan B. Anthony dollar, which was minted for only three years and never became popular.The episode makes references to several real-life persons. The piano-playing satirist who annoys Bart is a reference to Mark Russell and Tom Lehrer. Bob Arnold, the corrupt congressman, tells Lisa that there are quite a few women senators, but Lisa asserts that there are only two. (At the time, there were indeed only two, Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland.) Then-President George H. W. Bush is featured briefly in the episode. Shortly after it aired, Bush disparaged The Simpsons in a speech during his re-election campaign on January 27, 1992. At that point, family values were the cornerstone of Bush's campaign platform, so he gave the following speech at the National Religious Broadcasters' convention in Washington: \"We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons.\" As a result, Bush appeared in future episodes in a more negative light."

        "content": "\"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\" has been labeled as a satire on American politics. Michael Bitzer, in an edited book by Joseph Foy and Stanley Schultz entitled Homer Simpson Goes to Washington, said this episode \"espouses the virtues, vices, and varieties of American political culture, public opinion, and ultimately the American Dream\". Bitzer also wrote that The Simpsons, through \"skillful\" use of satire, demonstrates with this episode \"insights into the underlying political culture and public opinion of the United States' governing system (and, more broadly, society at large)\". In his book Gilligan Unbound: Pop Culture in the Age of Globalization, Paul Arthur Cantor said he was amazed by how far the episode was \"willing to take its corrosive satire of national politics\". He said it \"attacks the federal government at its foundation, the patriotic myths upon which its legitimacy lies. It makes fun of the very process by which patriotism is inculcated in the nation's youth, the hokey contests that lead children to outdo each other in progovernment effusions.\" When the corrupt congressman is arrested, Lisa proclaims \"The system works!\" Benedict Anderson wrote in the book The Spectre of Comparisons that series creator Matt Groening \"assumes that his tickled audience is confident that the system barely works [...] So why does he need to show a patriot at all, especially one who is a deluded little female block-head? Probably because he, too, wishes to be seen as giving America another chance. Mr. Lisa guarantees his good intentions.\"G\u00fcnter Beck, a lecturer for the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) at the Haifa Center for German and European Studies at the University of Haifa in Israel, compared Lisa's role in the episode to the nineteenth-century American poet and philosopher Henry David Thoreau. He writes that Lisa stands up against the public's indifference towards the political system that Thoreau criticized, and comments that the emphasis should be \"on the brave moral decision to stand up for principles and against the broad public. By this courageous act, 'to do what is right', an individual could save the well-being of the whole community. And indeed, Lisa's bravery is the impulse for the state's representatives to carry out their democratic obligations, so she can gladly notice 'The system works!' \u2014 her trust in democracy and its institutions is restored. Thoreau on the other hand, had no lasting trust in the system but only in the people themselves and in the individual's capacity to realize development and democracy.\""

Pughazh asks harder questions, and the Chief Minister starts trembling and asks him to put his money where his mic is and become his replacement CM for a day. After initially rejecting the offer, Pugazh agrees and does such a great job on his first day, that the actual cabinet collapses and fresh elections are held, where state voters eventually elect him to be their new official Chief Minister. The subsequent unpopularity and jealousy that the old Chief Minister goes through results in him taking revenge on Pugazh, and how he has stopped forms the crux of the story.\nThe film was released on 7 November 1999, as a Diwali release. The film received critical acclaim and became a huge blockbuster. This film was the second highest-grossing Tamil movie of 1999 after Padayappa.

        "content": "N. Pugazhendi alias Pugazh (Arjun Sarja) is a news reporter working for QTV in Chennai. One day, a riot occurs between the students and the bus drivers in the city following a communal clash that disrupts normal life. The Chief Minister of the state, Aranganathar, (Raghuvaran) informs the police over wireless not to arrest the protesters as they belong to his community and political party. The conversation is recorded by Pugazh in his video camera. Pugazh meets Thenmozhi (Manisha Koirala) and falls for her honesty and bravery. However, her father does not accept the marriage proposal as he wants to get Thenmozhi married only to a government employee.\nOne day, QTV arranges a live interview with Aranganathar, and the anchor in charge left his job and joined another television channel UTV, a rival of QTV. Pugazh is thrilled and excited as he gets the opportunity to interview the CM. During the course of the interview, Pugazh unmasks many events done by Aranganathar and his party against the welfare of the state, for political reasons with the necessary evidence, and he also blames Aranganathar for not taking action while at the riot by evidencing his recorded video taken at the time of the riot. Aranganathar justifies his indifferent stands and challenges Pugazh to accept his post for a day so that he will realise the pressures faced on a daily basis. Pugazh, after a brief trepidation, accepts the challenge provided the constitution permits. Lawmakers confirm that such a provision is possible, and Pugazh is sworn in as the CM for 24 hours.\nTo everyone's surprise, Pugazh does not prefer speaking to the waiting media crew, but he gets into action immediately by collecting a list of irresponsible civil servants and issuing suspension letters immediately. He helps poor people rightfully reclaim houses allotted by the government and requests every Indian citizen to pay all required taxes even if it is for a day, highlighting the effects of avoiding the same. Mayakrishnan (Manivannan), an honest official, is the government secretary and helps Pugazh through his one-day mission. Finally, Pugazh digs a case of corruption against the ruling party leading to the arrest of multiple ex-ministers and even Aranganathar. The same night, Aranganar obtains bail through the attorney general, without even going to Jail. Within minutes of release, he takes Pugazh's success as his defeat and a demean to his long-standing political career and sends goons to kill Pugazh, who fights off and escapes with minor injuries.\nPugazh visits Pooncholai and is applauded by the villagers for his actions in the Agri department. He spends his day with Thenmozhi in peace. Meanwhile, Aranganathar's image is tarnished before the public, and all of his coalition parties refuse to support him to become CM again, resulting in the dissolution of the legislature, and precipitating a General election. Surveys from multiple media indicate enormous public support for Pugazh to become CM, leading to Aranganathar's anger. He uses his clout to get Pugazh's house partly demolished.  Mayakrishnan meanwhile goes to the QTV office to convince Pugazh to come to politics, but Pugazh refuses and states that he is preparing for the TNPSC exam. QTV headquarters is then attacked heavily and Pugazh is nearly beaten to death.\nThe next morning, a huge crowd gathers in front of Pugazh's house, requesting him to contest in the upcoming election. Many political parties also come forward to get his support. However, Pugazh doesn't wish to contest as he wants to lead a normal life. Thenmozhi's father meets him and advises him not to go into politics while accepting his marriage to Thenmozhi, but Mayakrishnan makes Pugazh understand the vast support he has and shows the plight of people and advises him to sacrifice his comfort zone for the sake of achieving heights in the politics and doing good for the people. Finally, Pugazh accepts and contests in the ensuing election. His party wins by the vast majority of votes never seen in the political history of Tamil Nadu and takes all seats in the Legislature.\nAfter assuming the office, Pugazh is keen on state development and gets busy with his schedule of doing welfare to the people, while Aranganathar and other politicians unite and plot to avenge their political failure. Aranganathar hired a hitman to kill Pugazh with the help of Chinnasamy (Cochin Haneefa), his right-hand henchman . Pugazh goes to see Thenmozhi in Pooncholai village through personal way but due to his Z cadre police security, he cancel the meeting. To avoid their presence Pugazh change his look as a traditional Tamil man by wearing white dhotis, yellow colour shirt and blue scarf. Pugazh goes to meet Thenmozhi without the police security's knowledge. Pugazh visits there and enjoys with Thenmozhi. But unfortunately the hitman came there after spotting Pugazh with the help of a man. Pugazh narrowly escapes from the murder attempt with the help of the Z Cadre security guard officials, who kill the hitman. Thenmozhi's father (Vijayakumar) begged to Pugazh that he can't sent Thenmozhi with him due to his job or else he should resign it to join with Thenmozhi . Heartbroken Pugazh tells to his parents about the incident but they will help him by talking peacefully to Thenmozhi's father . Mayakrishnan phoned Pugazh to inform that someone has set a bomb in his house. When Pugazh hears this news from outside (there was no range inside the house, when Mayakrishnan phoned him), the bomb explodes by taking the lives of his parents. Pugazh gets devastated after seeing this . Enraged at learning that Aranganathar is behind in this who planned to bomb in Pugazh's home to kill him but unfortunately his parents get killed . Pugazh goes to Aranganathar to tell that why did he killed his parents instead of him. But he acts smartly that he didn't know about this incident. Devastated Pugazh challenges the latter that the law will not spare him. Aranganathar plans to create havoc in the state and has his men plant bombs across Chennai. Pugazh comes to know about this through a letter written by a priest who had accidentally sheltered these criminals (bomb planners) in latter's house. Pugazh and Mayakrishnan from Chinnasamy get to know about the places where the bombs are being planted. The bomb squad diffuses all the bombs except one.\nMeanwhile, Aranganathar blames Pugazh to be the man behind the entire episode and claims it was a ploy to win public support. Pugazh realises that he will be prevented from performing his duties and invites Aranganathar to his office. As their conversation progresses, Pugazh pulls out a gun and shoots himself without causing any major injuries. He throws the gun to Aranganathar who catches it out of his reflexes. At the same time, the security guards officials rush in upon hearing gunfire and see Aranganathar pointing the gun at Pugazh. The security guards shoot and kill Aranganathar. A dying Aranganathar remembers his old interview with Pugazh, which had changed everything. Mayakrishnan blames the deceased Aranganathar for trying to kill the Chief Minister out of political rivalry.\nPugazh feels glad that he can continue his mission without being interrupted, but he also feels guilty for having staged a false incident to kill Aranganathar. He confesses to Mayakrishnan that even he has been forced to play the game of politics. Mayakrishnan supports him by consoling that he played politics only for a good cause and that Aranganathar deserves this. Thenmozhi's father realises the greatness of Pugazhendhi and consents to the marriage. Due to the administration by Pugazh, the state has become a highly developed state with world-class infrastructures,free of violence and free from corruption."

It also dealt with the concept of opportunities for educated people in politics and demonstrated it is possible to bring change in the country. The film's basic idea was inspired from Nixon-Frost interviews which were broadcast in 1977 and also inspired by Indian actor Sivaji Ganesan being named the honorary mayor of Niagara Falls, New York for one day during his visit to the United States."

        "content": "When the existence of a strain of plague (vaguely identified as pneumonic) is revealed at the US mission at the International Health Organization, three terrorists seek to blow up the US mission. Two of them are shot, one mortally, by security personnel, but one escapes. The surviving terrorist is hospitalized and quarantined and identified as Swedish. Elena Stradner and US military intelligence Colonel Stephen Mackenzie argue over the nature of the strain, which Stradner suspects is a biological weapon but which Colonel Mackenzie claims was in the process of being destroyed.\nThe third terrorist, Eklund, escapes and stows away on a train travelling from Geneva to Stockholm. Stradner believes that the train should be stopped so that the terrorist can be removed and quarantined, but Col. Mackenzie is concerned that all of the passengers on the train might be infected. Mackenzie insists on rerouting the train to a disused railway line which goes to a former Nazi concentration camp in Janov, Poland where the passengers will be quarantined. However, the line crosses a dangerously unsound steel arch bridge known as the Kasundruv Bridge or the \"Cassandra Crossing\", out of use since 1948.\nMackenzie understands that the bridge might collapse as the train passes over it.\nThe presence of the infected terrorist, and the rerouting of the train, precipitates the second conflict, among passengers on the train who include Jonathan Chamberlain, a famous neurologist; his ex-wife Jennifer Rispoli Chamberlain, a writer; a former inmate of Janov and Holocaust survivor Herman Kaplan; and Nicole Dressler, the wife of a German arms dealer. She is embroiled in an affair with her young companion Robby Navarro. Navarro is a heroin trafficker being pursued by Interpol agent Haley, who is travelling undercover as a priest.\nMackenzie informs Chamberlain of the presence of Eklund, who is found hiding in the baggage car next to a caged basset hound, but attempts to remove him via helicopter are unsuccessful.  Just before the train enters a tunnel, the dog infected with Eklund's plague is transferred to the helicopter and taken back to the IHO lab.  Chamberlain is also told that the plague has a 60% mortality rate.  Mackenzie, however, informs passengers that police have received reports of anarchist bombs placed along the rail line, and that the train will be rerouted to Nuremberg. There the train is sealed with an enclosed oxygen system and a US Army medical team is placed aboard, with the now-deceased terrorist being placed in a hermetically sealed coffin. Chamberlain learns of the risk of the Cassandra Crossing.\nChamberlain also begins to suspect the disease is not as serious as originally thought: few of the passengers have become infected and few of those have actually died. He radios MacKenzie suggesting the infected portion of the train be uncoupled and isolated, but MacKenzie, acting under orders, has no intention of stopping the train: if, as expected, the Cassandra Crossing collapses, it will neatly cover the fact that the American military has been harbouring germ warfare agents in a neutral country. Chamberlain and Haley form a group of passengers to overcome the guards and seize control of the train before it reaches the doomed bridge.  At the lab, Dr. Stradner tests and monitors the ill dog, which spontaneously recovers, but Mackenzie is unimpressed and refuses to alter his plan.\nNavarro is killed by the guards as he attempts to reach the engine from the outside. Haley is killed during a firefight while protecting a girl passenger. Kaplan learns of the plot to blow up the club car's bottled gas supply and expose the coupler.  He sacrifices himself by setting off the explosion with a cigarette lighter.  Chamberlain manages to separate the rear half of the train, hoping that with less weight the front half will cross safely. But the bridge collapses, killing everyone aboard the front half. Max, the train's conductor, applies the manual brakes and stops the remaining cars just before reaching the downed bridge. The survivors soon evacuate the remaining cars and head off on foot, no longer under guard or quarantine. In Geneva, both Stradner and MacKenzie depart: she keeps hope of survivors while he feels quiet guilt over the whole affair. After they leave, Major Stack informs MacKenzie's superior that both the colonel and the doctor are under surveillance."

        "content": "Dawkins points to some of science's achievements and describes it as freeing most people from superstition and dogma. Picking up from his superstition-reason distinction in The Root of All Evil? (while recycling some footage from it), he then says reason is facing an \"epidemic of superstition\" that \"impoverishes our culture\" and introduces gurus that persuade us \"to run away from reality\". He calls the present day dangerous times. He returns to science's achievements, including the fact that, by extending people's lifespan, it helps them to take more advantage of life. \nHe turns his attention to astrology, which he criticizes for stereotyping without evidence. Having put astrology to the test and referred to larger-scale experiments, he then briefly describes the mechanics of astronomy, and then expresses frustration that 50% of the UK population \u2013 more than are members of one religion \u2013 believe in the paranormal.\nHe then visits a psychic medium, Simon Goodfellow, who makes statements Dawkins interprets as referring to retirement \u2013 which most people his age would soon be going in for but not Dawkins. Cornell then finds himself in contradiction over whether or not the \"spirit G\", who allegedly communicates with him, is Dawkins's family member. Cornell next tries suggesting this spirit was in the military \u2013 again, typical of deceased relatives of people Dawkins's age, but not of Dawkins. Cornell finishes with several explanations of why his powers might not always work, but Dawkins insists extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and then talks to the sceptical Derren Brown about cold reading, including misleading tricks it uses.\nIn another notable segment Dawkins visits a psychic for \u00a350 who said she could hear or see his father \"on the other side.\" Dawkins let the woman do the reading and at the end informed her that his father is alive, and he visits him frequently.Dawkins now visits a spiritualist church, and makes several criticisms of the alleged evidence of communication with the dead by medium Craig Hamilton-Parker, and adds that many may become obsessed with such performances and find it difficult to get over the loss of loved ones, adding that most people present are regulars. Hamilton-Parker says his psychic powers have been \"proven to me against my rationality\". Dawkins ends his study of s\u00e9ances by noting the arguments are based on untestable, private, subjective anecdotes, and compares this to religion.\nDawkins now describes the history of scientific knowledge of echolocation, and points to the cumulative build-up of corroborating evidence for scientific explanations of the phenomena. He visits psychologist Chris French, who is performing a double-blind test of dowsing. None of the dowsers perform better, in a statistically significant sense, than is expectable by chance alone. While the dowsers are surprised, Dawkins and French note that their confidence is untouched, and they prefer explanations (French states some may call them excuses) that retain the hypothesis that they have paranormal dowsing powers. Dawkins next attempts his own explanation of belief in the paranormal in a combination of evolutionary and psychological terms, saying: \"we don\u2019t want to believe things just happen\", and he suggests superstition is just the sort of animal error committed by Skinner's pigeons.\nDawkins now interviews Satish Kumar about ideas such as 'treeness' and 'rockness'. Dawkins points out that it is all evidence-free assertion. He responds to the \"science is bleak\" argument by saying that the world is so wonderful that the word 'mundane' has a mismatched meaning and etymology. He then complains about the long-term fall in the number of students taking chemistry and physics at A-level. He suggests this is partly because of the UK education system encouraging students to value personal feeling over evidence and reason. He interviews the relativist Steve Fuller and criticises him for being \"so close to being right but ... damn wrong\". Fuller points out that different people can interpret the same evidence differently. Fuller also points out the benefits of the Internet, and Dawkins agrees, but then turns to the dangers it poses in causing the spread of fabricated statements. He also points to the fact that the MMR vaccine scandal involved an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory about the UK government. Dawkins concludes that reason \"built the modern world. It is a precious but fragile thing\"."

        "content": "Richard Dawkins examines the growing suspicion the public has for science-based medicine, despite its track record of successes like the germ theory of disease, vaccines, antibiotics and increased lifespan. He notes a fifth of British children are currently not immunised against measles, mumps and rubella, attributing it to fears arising from a highly controversial report linking the vaccine with autism.\nDawkins criticizes the growing field of alternative medicine which does not pass the same objective and statistical rigour as scientifically derived treatments using controlled double-blind studies. Without verifiable evidence, alternative therapies must rely on biased anecdotes and word of mouth to perpetuate. Dawkins observes these treatments have fanciful rationales and rituals behind them, with many alternative treatments employing pseudoscientific jargon such as \"energy\", \"vibration\" or \"quantum theory\" to give themselves greater credence to patients.\nHomeopathy is singled out as an example of a mainstream alternative medicine that has public support and taxpayer funding through the National Health Service. Dawkins explains that the rationale behind it is unfounded and demonstrates that the magnitude of dilution required is so great the patient is practically imbibing pure water. This is illustrated by the typical homeopathic dilution of 30C (1:10030, that is thirty steps of dilution by 1% each time), which requires a drop of active ingredient dissolved in a body of water greater than the whole ocean. Dawkins cites a 2005 meta-analysis by The Lancet that concludes that homeopathy has no consistently demonstrable effect on health.Dawkins hypothesises that practitioners of alternative medicine spend longer time than regular doctors on their patients when attending to them. An interview with Professor Nicholas Humphrey suggests that this empathic attention may cause a placebo effect in patients, but this is not a substitute for conventional science-based medicine.\nThe episode concludes with Dawkins making an appeal to skeptical, rational inquiry based on evidence, claiming \"reason has liberated us from superstition and given us centuries of progress. We abandon it at our peril.\""

During the session, Veronica plants a stapler with a microphone on the desk. Meanwhile, Sheriff Lamb questions a student, Rick (J.D. Pardo), on his fake IDs. When questioned further, Rick says that Veronica made the IDs, although she did not. During a locker check, Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) finds blank fake IDs spilling out of her locker, as well as four in her purse. Veronica is arrested and taken down to the station. At the station, Veronica confronts Rick. Rick says that an unspecified \"they\" forced him to blame Veronica. Later, Logan walks through the hallway and faces scorn and stares from the other students because of the incident with his father. Weevil (Francis Capra) talks to Rebecca while Veronica listens through her car radio. Rebecca shows proof that Weevil and Lilly were dating. Veronica wonders why Lilly didn't tell Veronica about her relationship with Weevil. Veronica meets with Rick in secret, and Rick tells her that a secret society called the Tritons decided to blame her. He is a recent inductee who was trying to get on their good side. Rick also tells Veronica that Duncan (Teddy Dunn) is part of the group.\nVeronica puts a tracker on Duncan's car. Logan is suspended for a fight that broke out in school. Keith (Enrico Colantoni) and Cliff (Daran Norris) tell Veronica that Rick's friend Tim's family is suing Veronica and Keith because they believe that Veronica created the fake IDs. Later, Wallace tells Veronica that he heard that a mystery locker at school dispenses fake IDs if the participant pays $250. Veronica positions a camera in order to watch the locker 24/7. Rebecca talks to Logan, and Veronica hears over the radio. Logan says that he blames Veronica for Lilly's death. Veronica and Wallace track Duncan to a mysterious location, which turns out to be a club. Veronica finds Duncan and asks him who the leader is, but he doesn't give anything up. Soon afterwards, Duncan brings Veronica a message from \"The Great Triton,\" and she has to do karaoke onstage in order to elicit a response from the Triton leader. After the song, she meets with the supposed leader, but it is actually an impostor who reveals that a prank has been played on Veronica. Meanwhile, Rick has become targeted by the Tritons, who threaten him. Veronica hears Duncan's conversation with Rebecca. Duncan states that he has forgotten the days leading up to Lilly's murder.\nVeronica is abducted and locked in her trunk. After being rescued by Wallace, she hears a Triton chant through her car radio. Veronica goes into the school and sees a ritualistic initiation meeting. She reveals herself and snaps a few photos. The Tritons give chase, but Veronica escapes before they can catch her. Veronica tries to match one of the Tritons to a person who operated the mystery locker, but finds nothing. Veronica visits Sheriff Lamb and makes him a deal\u2014if she doesn't catch the thief by that day, she will plead guilty to any charges. She then asks Lamb to put a student's name into a locker and see what happens. Logan's parents have an argument that becomes increasingly heated before Logan blows up at his dad. Rick goes down to the station and Veronica explains the situation. Rick has been collecting the money from the locker through a hatch. He has been running his own fake IDs, and blamed the Tritons because he was angry at them for not asking him to join. When Veronica asks Rick why he blamed her, he states that it was because Keith's investigations made his family lose money and his parents get a divorce. Meanwhile, we hear a police report that Logan's mother, Lynn (Lisa Rinna), has just committed suicide."

She tries to identify the individual by observing the group's reactions to a horror story. In her story, a couple, played by Britta and Jeff (Joel McHale), makes out in a car until an escaped psychopath attacks. Abed (Danny Pudi) criticizes the story as cliched and offers an improved version. The group proceeds to tell their own \"horror\" stories, all taking place in a cabin.\nIn Abed's story, he and Britta visit a secluded cabin. Abed takes every logical precaution, such as bringing a radio and awaiting the escaped psychopath by standing back-to-back holding knives, boring everyone. In Annie's (Alison Brie) romantic story, she is a schoolteacher who tames Jeff, a vampire, by teaching him how to read. When Jeff turns on Annie, she reveals herself to be a werewolf and mutilates him, horrifying the group. In Troy's (Donald Glover) story, he and Abed are fighter pilots who encounter a crazed doctor, Pierce (Chevy Chase), who sews them together. However, this gives Troy and Abed psychokinetic powers, with which they knock Pierce unconscious. As revenge, they sew Pierce's buttocks to his chest and swap his hands and feet, creeping out the group. In Pierce's story, he is a stud surrounded by sultry versions of Annie, Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown), and Britta. When Abed and Troy, as stereotypical hood film characters, invade his home, Pierce easily subdues them, baffling the group. In Shirley's story, the Rapture occurs while the other group members party and use drugs. The Devil, portrayed by Dean Pelton (Jim Rash), enters, but Shirley holds him off temporarily before rising to Heaven, leaving the others to be tortured, offending the group.\nBored, the group tries to leave. Britta stops them by revealing the test results and explaining how the disturbed individual could kill them. Her gruesome descriptions and the flickering lights create alarm. To calm everyone down, Jeff tells a story wherein a hookman attacks the group. After questioning by Jeff, the hookman reveals himself to be Chang (Ken Jeong) and asks for a hug, and the group accepts him warmly. Jeff's story, however, fails to calm his friends, as they think he's trying to divert attention away from himself. Jeff admits he filled out his test paper randomly, frustrating the group. Annie checks the papers and realizes Britta scanned them upside down. The corrected results reveal that every group member except one is crazy. The group decides not to determine who it is so they can each hope they are the sane one. The final shot reveals that Abed was the one member of the group who tested as sane."

Seven of those children were adopted by eccentric billionaire Sir Reginald Hargreeves, and turned into a superhero team known as \"The Umbrella Academy\". In the present, five of these children, now grown-up, live separate lives. Luther \"Number 1\" lives on the moon, Diego \"Number 2\" stops a home invasion, Allison \"Number 3\" walks on the red carpet at a film premiere, Klaus \"Number 4\" leaves rehab and immediately begins to use drugs, and Vanya \"Number 7\" plays the violin. After watching the news, they all learn about Sir Reginald Hargreeves's death.\nThe children decide to reunite in their old home, the academy, to talk about their father's death. Visiting his father's bedroom, Luther begins to suspect that his father was murdered by one of the others, as his monocle is missing. Diego reassures Luther that the coroner stated that Sir Reginald died of heart failure but Luther remains suspicious. In a flashback to the Umbrella Academy's first public appearance, the academy successfully stop a bank robbery. Sir Reginald and Vanya watch the action from a rooftop, and Vanya asks why she can't help. Sir Reginald tells Vanya that she just isn't special, and later in an interview, he tells the public that he adopted six children, instead of seven.\nBack in the present, a lightning storm causes the group to go outside. Once there, they watch as a young Five \"Number 5\", one of the siblings, arrives at the academy through a strange ball of blue energy. Five explains that he traveled to the future, came back, and became stuck in his 13-year-old body, though he's actually a 58-year-old man. Later, the group holds a funeral for Sir Reginald. In a flashback, Sir Reginald trains and monitors all the children. He also gives all of them a tattoo of an umbrella on their wrists, except Vanya, who draws her own umbrella tattoo using a pen. In the present, the group part ways.\nFive visits a coffee shop, where he kills several men who try to kidnap him. At a river, Diego is revealed to have taken Sir Reginald's monocle, which he dumps in a river. Klaus, who has the ability to talk to dead people, begins to talk with his dead sibling, Ben \"Number 6\". The episode ends with Five visiting Vanya, where he tells her that in eight days the human race will come to an end, but he doesn't know why or how."

When the man tousles Charlie's hair a fight starts. Charlie then returns home, holding a bunch of fresh onions, as though they were flowers, and trying to work out what the smell is.

Cameron injects a serum made from a wolf's blood into the cooperative Petro, who loses consciousness, grows fur and fangs, and awakens after he has transformed into a wolfman.\nCameron turns to an empty table, visualizing his former colleagues sitting there: The four professors dismissed his theory that wolf blood transfusions could be used to give a human being wolf-like traits. He recalls how the scientific community, the press, and the public joined in a resounding chorus of ridicule that finally cost him his position at the university.\nAddressing the four spectral professors, Cameron declares, \"Right now, we're at war, at war with an enemy that produces a horde that strikes with a ferocious fanaticism\". Cameron proposes giving wolfman traits to soldiers in order to help win the war. When the professors scoff, Cameron says to them that his proposal doesn't really matter; he is going to have his wolfman kill them one-by-one. For the time being, however, he administers an antidote that transforms Petro back to normal; Petro remembers nothing.\nThe following night, Cameron injects Petro again and sends him into the swamp. As a wolfman, he enters a nearby home and kills a little girl. Hearing about the child's death, Cameron knows his formulation works. Now he can proceed to eliminate his former colleagues. He begins by setting up elaborate encounters in which Petro, left alone with each scientist, makes his wolfman transformation. The more times this happens, however, the more unpredictable Petro becomes while killing them.\nCameron's daughter Lenora is romantically involved with Tom Gregory, a newspaper reporter investigating the death of the little girl. As the professors are killed, Gregory begins to suspect that Cameron is behind the murders.\nThe principals arrive at the Cameron home as a large thunderstorm begins. A bolt of lightning suddenly strikes, setting Cameron's laboratory on fire. Lenora and Tom are able escape from the spreading fire after first encountering an agitated Petro, now in his wolfman form.

A collection of silk screened portraits by Bruce LaBruce from the film were also shown at the exhibit, mostly pictures showcasing Sagat as a zombie. The Locarno International Film Festival screened L.A. Zombie in competition from August 4\u201316 of 2010.The film was due to have its second and third screening as part of the Melbourne International Film Festival (MIFF) in Australia on August 7 and 8, 2010. However, the Australian Film Classification Board advised festival organisers that the film could not be screened as it was likely to be refused classification. Under Australian law, films that are refused classification may not be imported, sold, or distributed, which precludes screening at public events. In defiance of this censorship, the Melbourne Underground Film Festival, which occurs concurrently with MIFF but screens films regarded as too controversial for the mainstream event, held an illegal screening of L.A. Zombie on August 29. While police did not attend or stop the screening on the night, they did raid the home of director Richard Wolstencroft on the morning of November 11, 2010. Wolstencroft admitted to police that an August 29 screening had occurred, but claimed to have destroyed the only copy of the film afterwards. The court ruled that he pay $750 to the Royal Children's Hospital.L.A. Zombie held its UK premiere at the Raindance Film Festival in London on October 1, 2010. It was reported that \"at least one-third of the audience walked out stupefied\".TLA Releasing picked up the U.S. release for the film, and set November 12, 2010 as the DVD date. The DVD release is an uncut version, longer than the film festival release's runtime.In New Zealand, the film was first screened at the Out Takes LGBT film festival in Auckland and Wellington. Unlike Australia, New Zealand's Office of Film and Literature Classification gave the film an R18 certificate, which means that it can be screened as long as the audience is aged eighteen and over. The Society for Promotion of Community Standards called for review of the decision, while GayNZ.com welcomed its release. SPCS failed to have the film prohibited after the review and it was resultantly screened at the Out Takes film festival in Auckland and Wellington in early June 2011."

It features Vittorio Gassman in the main role. It was entered into the 1966 Cannes Film Festival.The term Armata Brancaleone is still used today in Italian to define a group of badly assembled and poorly equipped people.

        "content": "The movie opens with a small Italian village being stormed by a band of Hungarian pillagers. When the murders and rapes are over, a German knight arrives and bravely kills the bandits. However, as he is healing his wounds he is attacked by two of the surviving villagers and one of the thieves. They throw the wounded knight into a river.\nThe attackers try to sell the knight's armor and weapons to a miserly Jewish merchant who finds among his belongings a letter of donation by the Holy Roman Emperor, granting the knight the fief of Aurocastro, an Apulian town. The parchment is torn at the lower end, which refers to a condition the knight must fulfill to enjoy the donation.\nThe Hungarian bandit comes up with the idea to propose a partnership to a cadet nobleman, so the group can take possession of the aforementioned fief and enjoy its riches. The knight they find is the poor and incompetent, yet well-meaning, Brancaleone da Norcia and they tell him that a noble knight handed them the parchment before dying. Brancaleone initially refuses the plan but after a farcical defeat at a jousting tournament that promised the hand of an overlord's daughter and a wealthy fief, he is too eager to take command of this \"army\" (L'Armata) of underdogs and lead it towards \"fortune\" and \"glory\", in what he sees as an epic journey.\nAs they set up towards the fief, Brancaleone lives several grotesque adventures, inspired by the confused and cosmopolitan world of Italy during Middle Ages; each one of them more hilarious than the last. These include:\n\nA Byzantine knight, Teofilatto dei Leonzi (Gian Maria Volont\u00e9), who proposes to fake his capture by the band so they can demand and share a ransom from his father.\nAn entire city seemingly abandoned, which they begin to pillage, until they find out that it was depopulated by plague.\nA fanatical mad monk, Zenone (Enrico Maria Salerno), who promises that those who join his army of Crusaders will be \"healed\" from all ills, having the band follow him to a crusade in the Holy Land. When trying to convince his followers to cross a precarious bridge by leaping upon it (crying out loud that the Lord would protect them), the monk falls down into a deep gorge - this releases the band to follow their previous quest.\nThe rescue of a bride named Matelda (Catherine Spaak), who falls in love with Brancaleone, but is rejected by him due to his oath to take her to her groom; to Brancaleone's misfortune, she avenges herself by losing her virginity to the Byzantine knight (by then a member of the gang); later, while the 'army' is relaxing at her nuptial feast her husband finds out about her state and she accuses Brancaleone of deflowering her.\ngiving in to Teofilatto's plan, the army arrives at his father's castle to demand a ransom. His father refuses to pay, revealing that Teofilatto is his illegitimate child. Meanwhile, a confused Brancaleone has to fend off the sadomasochistically-fueled passion of Teofilatto's aunt, just one example of the inbred Byzantine household.When finally the band reaches the fief, they discover that the missing part of their parchment mentioned that condition for the granting of the fief was that its new ruler should have provided adequate defences against the \"black scourge coming from the sea\", frequent raids by Saracen corsairs. Brancaleone designs a cartoonish Rube Goldberesque trap to defeat the Saracens, but instead the band ends up trapped within. As the band is about to be executed by impalement, it is saved by the knight of the opening scenes, the rightful owner of the fief, thirsty for vengeance against his attackers.\nBrancaleone (who did not know about the attack on the knight) and his army are about to be burned alive when the mad monk arrives out of the blue and saves them from the knight, \"so they can fulfill their duty to go onto the Holy Land\". Being deprived of his dreams of richness, Brancaleone and his band agree to go along with the monk and his followers, saving themselves. Albeit sad, when he finds his untrustworthy horse, Brancaleone mounts and regains his confidence, taking the lead from the monk. The story is continued in a follow-up film, Brancaleone alle Crociate (1970)."

        "content": "The plot is structured as a series of sketches revolving around different parodies of the Middle Ages world: it is itself a parody of the classical knights' quest typical of Middle Ages tales. Age and Scarpelli devised for the characters a striking, mocking form of a mixture of Italian (including its dialects) and Latin languages, which is probably the main feature of the film and one of the keys to its success. Gassman's overbearing and pompous recitation was also perfect for the role. The main musical theme of the film was also a great success.\nAccording to Monicelli, the idea for the movie was spurred by a simple scene written by Age and Scarpelli, about two mediaeval peasants talking about women. Monicelli suggested that they shoot a movie which avoids the stereotypes of the usual Hollywood Middle Ages movies. It would instead show \"the other face\" of the era: poor people, underdogs, ignorance, mud, cold, misery.\nThere is no such stereotype left standing: the oppressed villagers are capable of violence themselves (they are prey to the bandits, but join them to attack their saving knight); the clergy, depicted by the hallucinating monk, fanatical to the extreme, always capable of explaining misfortunes by \"lack of faith\" of his entourage; the miserly Jewish merchant; the heroine/princess in distress, who instead of ending up with the hero asks to be deflowered by another man just to spite him. Finally, the archetypical medieval hero, the knight, has in the clueless Brancaleone its greatest parody, always jeopardized by following his chivalric code of conduct; as for his dreams of glory, he leads an army of underdogs that are a little more than a band of cowardly bandits who flee from fights and feign submission while actively trying to manipulate him from the bottom.\nUnderdogs and humiliated people were constantly present in Monicelli's art, but in this case they are shown mainly from a comical side. Another important theme of the film is male friendship, which was also an important element in movies such as La grande guerra and the later Amici miei.\nThe costumes often provide a near-surreal effect, particularly in the wedding banquet and Byzantine castle scenes. Their designer, Piero Gherardi, won a Silver Ribbon for them in 1967."

No one in the office wants to set up any of their friends with Michael, but when Michael learns that the chair model had died in a car crash some time ago, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) takes pity and sets him up on a blind date with her landlady (Brooke Dillman). The date does not go well, beginning with Michael pretending he is not who she was supposed to be meeting. After Michael admits his own blind date was a failure, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) convinces him that he needs closure on this person he loved who is gone.

        "content": "\"Chair Model\" was the third episode of the series directed by Jeffrey Blitz. Blitz had previously directed \"The Convict\" and \"The Negotiation\". The episode was written by B. J. Novak, who plays temporary worker turned corporate manager Ryan Howard. Novak was originally going to name the episode \"Michael Dating\", but the title could have potentially been a spoiler because fans with DVRs would have seen it before \"Dinner Party\" aired and deduced that Michael and Jan's relationship had completely fallen apart. For a while, \"Parking\" was going to be the title, but even that was decided against because that refers to the subplot, and also because it was generic and boring even by the show's no-frills-titles standard. Eventually, someone suggested \"Chair Model\", which was eventually kept as the name. Originally, Novak wrote Jim putting Dwight through a \"phony management training\", but NBC pointed out that it felt like the writers had done it before even though they had not. As a group, the writers tried to think of a new idea for the plot; they considered having Pam move in with Jim, but they thought that first the two should be engaged.There was an auditioning process for both the chair model (Deborah Shoshlefski played by April Eden) and the young blond woman whom Michael sees in the coffee shop. According to Novak, the chair model was supposed to be \"pretty\" and \"perhaps even prettier than your average model\", but more of just an \"average single girl\", because the episode is more about Michael wanting to start dating again than the model herself.  In the scene with the \"Five Families\", one of the actors, Paul Faust was the only first-time actor. Faust is the cousin of writer Paul Lieberstein, and had been on a tour of the set and talked to many of the writers. He made a good impression and so the character of \"Cool Guy Paul\" was based on him. The day before they were scheduled to shoot, the show still had not cast anyone for the role, so they called Paul in New York City and had him read the lines into a camera and e-mail to them. In less than an hour, Faust had landed the part and was flown out to Los Angeles.Although Novak wrote the majority of the episode, Jennifer Celotta and Paul Lieberstein were actually the ones who came up with the graveyard scene in the end. The original song for Michael to sing was going to be a parody of \"Candle in the Wind\" by Elton John. Elton John however, refused to give The Office permission to use the song, because 30 Rock had requested permission for a parody of \"Candle in the Wind\" that offended Elton John, and he did not want to have his song parodied again. So then, the writers wrote parodies of \"Legs\" by ZZ Top and \"Ruby Tuesday\" by The Rolling Stones, but eventually \"American Pie\" by Don McLean cleared, so the writers went with it."

        "content": "While watching a 1950s science fiction movie, Bart and Lisa see a commercial for a model rocket kit and Bart orders it by using Homer's credit card number. Homer helps Bart and Milhouse build it, but it blows up before launching. Jealous that Ned Flanders built a superior rocket, Homer enlists the help of his former nerdy college roommates, Gary, Doug, and Benjamin, to build a rocket piloted by the hamster Nibbles. The rocket lifts off successfully, but it develops complications and Nibbles bails out. Homer attempts to shoot down the rocket with a 12 gauge shotgun, but the rocket crashes into the church. The church council meets up to decide how to come up with money to fund the repairs to the church. With no other aid available, they accept help from Mr. Burns and Lindsay Naegle, who wish to run the church as a business. The two rebuild the church as a commercial monstrosity, complete with advertising signs, a currency exchanger, a Lard Lad statue, a photo booth for the churchgoers to put their faces in a cut-out of Jesus from The Last Supper, and a Jumbotron known as \"Godcam\". Lisa is appalled at this and after Lovejoy welcomes The Noid to hold a sermon \"on the sanctity of deliciousness,\" she abandons the church, feeling her religion has lost its soul.That night, Lisa prays to God and assures him she has not turned her back on Him, but plans to seek a new path to \u201cHim\u201d (or \u201cHer,\u201d she says). While on a walk around town, passing many sacrilegious signs, she finds Springfield's Buddhist temple. Inside she sees Lenny and Carl meditating, and Hollywood actor Richard Gere teaches the core concepts of Buddhism to her. An intrigued Lisa takes a pamphlet on Buddhism and studies it at home. It convinces her of the virtues of the faith, and Lisa announces out her window she has become, and forever will be, a Buddhist. Lisa plants her own bodhi tree in the back yard and begins to meditate, but Marge grows increasingly worried about Lisa's soul and tries to convince her to come back to Christianity.\nAt the church council meeting, Reverend Lovejoy tells Marge to use Christmas to bribe her back. Homer places a tasteless animatronic angel on top of Lisa's bodhi tree, and Marge bakes cookies, decorates the home, and has Ralph and Milhouse dress as a pony in wrapping paper to tempt her, but Lisa runs from the home when she realizes what is happening. At the Buddhist temple, she tells Gere her family tried to trick her, but Gere informs her that while Buddhism is about one finding inner peace, it is also about respecting the diversity of other religions based on love and compassion. Thus, Lisa is free to celebrate any holiday with her family, including Christmas. Lisa goes back home, falling asleep beside the Christmas tree and tells everyone that she will be celebrating Christmas with them and continue paying lip service to Christianity while practicing Buddhism for the rest of her life. As Marge takes her to the kitchen to get some cookies for her, Lisa asks about her pony, and Marge tries unsuccessfully to change the subject as Lisa calls out for her gift."

        "content": "\"She of Little Faith\" was directed by Steven Dean Moore and was the only episode Bill Freiberger wrote for The Simpsons. It was first broadcast on Fox in the United States on December 16, 2001.Before returning to work full-time on The Simpsons, Jean had worked on a television series called Teen Angel together with Mike Reiss and Freiberger. While working on Teen Angel, Freiberger suggested that, if Jean was ever to run The Simpsons, he should hire Freiberger as a writer on the series. For the thirteenth season, Jean became show runner and assigned Freiberger to write the episode. Freiberger wrote the first draft as a freelance script at his parents' barn in Pennsylvania, and when he returned to the writing staff to rewrite the story, Freiberger took so many notes that the script became 106 pages long. As a result, Freiberger spent more time editing down the script rather than writing it. The episode's main plot, in which Lisa becomes a Buddhist, was pitched by Jean, who wanted to expand Lisa's personality. When he pitched the plot idea to the Simpsons writing staff, they became concerned about the episode's originality. They argued that the series had already explored religious themes in earlier episodes, but Jean assured them that the episode would be about Lisa first-and-foremost, rather than Buddhism. Unlike several other episodes in the series in which a character undergoes a change in their personality, Lisa has remained a Buddhist since this episode, much like her conversion to vegetarianism in \"Lisa the Vegetarian\".Freiberger pitched the subplot involving the model rockets in the beginning of the episode. He based it on a real-life experience, in which he, as a child, accidentally launched a model rocket into a window in his house. A scene from this subplot was removed from the episode following the September 11 attacks. The scene would show a man named Hassan Jay Salam being arrested by policemen (who tells them to call his cousin Casey Kasem), who think the rocket Bart and Homer launched was launched by him (The rocket bears the abbreviation HJS, which stands for Homer J Simpson). After the attacks, the scene was considered too offensive by the Fox censors, so the scene was removed. Originally, the subplot would involve Marge trying to get Homer to build model rockets with Bart. Homer would not want to at first, but after Marge convinces him, he would soon get more into it than Bart. The plot idea was encouraged by some of the writers who thought that Marge had \"gotten short shrift,\" and, according to Freiberger, Marge would have had a \"really big part motivating the story\" had the subplot remained intact.\nThe renovated church in the episode is built like a mall; several stores and merchandising is located inside, and Reverend Lovejoy plugs products and television programs during his sermons. The scene is used to satirize the so-called \"megachurches\" and the commercialization sometimes associated with these institutions. The episode also argues that, even if Christmas has lost most of its meaning, it is more important to \"keep these thoughts to oneself in order to make the family happy.\" It also comments on what the writers believe to be the \"all or nothing, we're right, you're all going to hell mentality\" of some Christian movements. Even though \"She of Little Faith\" is a Christmas episode, the holiday is not mentioned until the episode's third act. Jean stated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode that the writers did not want to make a conventional Christmas episode, and instead wanted to \"slide into\" the subject.The episode features actor Richard Gere as himself. Gere agreed to guest star under three conditions, the first being that Buddhism should be portrayed accurately, the second, that Lisa remain a Buddhist for the rest of the series, and his third and strongest request being that Lisa should say \"Free Tibet\" in the episode. Jean agreed, but Gere ended up with the line. However, Lisa did yell out \"Free Tibet\" in an episode in the following season. Gere's lines were recorded in New York City by Jean who, in the DVD audio commentary for the episode, stated that Gere was \"great\" and that he \"didn't mind being made fun of\" in the episode. He also mentioned that Gere was one of the only guest-stars they had that \"looked handsome simpsonized.\""

He especially liked Flanders' line \"My Satan sense is tingling.\"Jennifer Malkowski, who gave the episode a B\u2212, wrote that the episode's \"highlight\" was a scene in which \"Milhouse mourns his 'beautiful eyebrows'\" that were burned off by Bart and Homer's model rocket.In 2007, Simon Crerar of The Times listed Gere's performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos in the history of the show.Ron Martin of 411Mania, who consider episodes about Lisa to be \"traditional channel changers\", wrote that it \"offers one of the worst \u2018Lisa episodes\u2019\" of the series.Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide criticized the episode for being \"little more than a retread\" of earlier episodes of the series.

Bob remembers that the town served as the filming location of a shark-themed \u201880s B movie, The Deepening. The family discovers that the original prop shark from the movie is up for sale and convinces Fischoeder to buy it. However, Teddy ominously objects.\nAt the unveiling of the shark, the Belchers find out Fischoeder has filled it with diesel. The shark, which is now able to move, nearly causes an accident by ripping off a woman\u2019s prosthetic arm. Early the next morning, the Belcher kids sneak off to Wonder Wharf to steal the shark\u2019s fin for \"mechanical shark fin soup.\" Gene mounts the shark with a knife to cut off its fin, but he accidentally knocks the shark off its perch: the kids leave, and Louise tells her siblings to act like they were \"never there.\"\nThat same morning, Bob notices people panicking outside and goes to investigate. He arrives at Wonder Wharf to find the mechanical shark flopping around on the ground. Fischoeder reveals there is no way to stop the shark until it runs out of gas; furthermore, he is reluctant to stop it, as it is now drawing larger crowds than ever. Bob worries the shark will leave the wharf and pleads with Fischoeder, but it is already too late: the shark smashes through the gates of Wonder Wharf and runs amok in traffic.\nBob, as \u201cBlock Captain,\u201d rallies the local business owners to figure out what to do about the shark. Tina, who empathized with the shark after watching The Deepening, tries to dissuade the townspeople from stopping its progress. After she impulsively confesses that she and the kids knocked over the shark, the townspeople begin to turn on the Belchers. But Teddy encourages the townspeople to work together, and they begin brainstorming how to stop the shark, which is now heading towards Bob's restaurant.\nEach of the townspeople's ideas goes horribly wrong and only serves to make the shark more dangerous: a spike strip becomes attached to the shark, an oil slick intended to \u201cslow its momentum\u201d ends up making it faster, and after it hits a telephone pole, it becomes electrified. Finally, the shark falls into a hole in the ground that the townspeople dug to catch it. This seems to work until subterranean noises indicate the shark has eaten its way into Bob\u2019s basement.\nBob, Teddy, and Mort enter the restaurant to try and stop the shark. Teddy reveals the reason for his hatred of the shark: he acted as a lifeguard in The Deepening. While talking to a girl on set, the prop operator startled him with the shark, causing him to spill his drink on the girl and embarrass himself. Bob asks Teddy why he resents the shark instead of the operator; Teddy stops to consider this logic briefly before deciding he still hates the shark.\nThe shark emerges from the ground, knocking Mort into the basement. Teddy falls into the shark\u2019s mouth, though his \"boydle\" prevents him from being crushed by its teeth. Tina gets the idea to fill the shark with ice cream from their soft serve machine, which has fallen inside the shark\u2019s body. Bob is able to plug in the machine, and the shark, now filled with ice cream, finally ends its rampage. On a news report, Hugo, the health inspector and \"Quadrant Captain,\" takes credit for stopping the shark."

In the absence of any real opportunity to revise these changes, I withdrew from the project.\" Forbes said, \"I regret this very much and so does the producer.\" Delaney had her name removed from the credits. \"It was never our intention to ask her, or try to maneuvre her, into a position where she would not have credit,\" said Forbes. \"She felt the version was too far removed from her conception. There were no hard words. I have yet to find a film that was not changed during production. I am very sorry.\"Nanette Newman later recalled:\n\nEverybody took a cut in salary, it was done on a very small budget and we were just a little group of people in a house. It had a wonderful feeling: shots would be grabbed, you worked in what you arrived in (there were no costumes), and you had a feeling of everybody pulling together, wanting the film to be good.

Chidambaram's father, who appeared for the agent, sends his son to Thoothukudi lest the British proprietor should give him any trouble. Madasami who accompanies Chidambaram, looks after the latter's salt-pan. At Thoothukudi, Chidambaram meets Subramaniya Siva, a freedom fighter and works for the Swadeshi movement.\nChidambaram receives a complaint from some of the local merchants that the British Shipping Company had refused to load their goods. Against great odds, Chidambaram starts the National Shipping Company with Indian Capital to free Indian trade from dependence on foreign liners. The company prospers despite attempts by the British Company to sabotage the ship of the Indian firm. Chidambaram incurs the displeasure of the Government by organising a strike for getting the grievances of the local coral mill workers redressed and by organising public celebrations to mark the release of Bipin Chandra Pal in contravention of a prohibitory order.\nChidambaram, along with Siva, is invited to Tirunelveli by the District Collector, Winch. The collector directs them not to engage in political activity and also orders them out of the District. They defy the orders and are arrested. In the trial which ensues, Chidambaram is sentenced to 20 years life imprisonment and Siva to 10 years. Chidambaram's sentence is reduced to six years on appeal. The imprisonment of these two leaders sparks off mass unrest which is put down ruthlessly. Some time later, the new District Collector Ashe is shot dead by a patriotic Vanchinathan, who commits suicide before the police can reach him.\nThe news of the unrelenting struggle outside gives much consolation to Chidambaram and Siva who are treated barbarously in the prison. Chidambaram emerges from the prison a broken man only to witness a series of disappointments \u2013 Chidambaram's brother has become insane, Siva is a victim of leprosy contracted during his term in prison, people have forgotten him and his role in the Indian independence movement, the National Shipping Company is bought by its British rival and leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Bharathiyar die one after another.

The film is based on the 1944 book of the same name by M. P. Sivagnanam, a biography of Chidambaram Pillai. During a time when the DMK was gaining political ground in Tamil Nadu, a time when there was competition between parties, and films were pitched against each other, the opposition unleashed a malicious propaganda that since Chidambaram belonged to the Indian National Congress, Kappalottiya Thamizhan was a film for the Congress. Certain people did not want the masses to be \"stirred\" by the nationalist spirit.Sivaji Ganesan was hesitant to do the role of Chidambaram Pillai as he doubted whether he could perform the role flawlessly, but later accepted and studied various material to understand Chidambaram Pillai. S. V. Subbaiah was cast as the poet Subramania Bharati alias Bharathiyar, taking inspiration from his role as Kavi Anandar from the play Kaviyin Kanavu (1945). V. Nagayya who was then in \"dire straits\", was signed up for a significant role, that of Ulaganathan Pillai, as Panthulu wanted to give him a \"break in films\".According to historian S. Theodore Baskaran, there is no evidence of any research undertaken for making the film. He stated that the film had no props, apart from the character's costumes and the female characters' ear-lobes, which were done to create a \"period effect\". Though then known for his theatrical-style acting, Ganesan tried acting naturally during the prison sequences and his character's trauma of disillusionment. While primarily in black and white, the film was partly coloured using Gevacolor, and the colour sequences were processed at the Film Centre, Mumbai."

He also stated that he was not upset for losing money making the film to kindle the national spirit, but rather happy that he could harness the medium to remind people of the Indian freedom fighters of the bygone era.

        "content": "\"Attack on Cloudbase\" is the 31st episode of Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, a British Supermarionation television series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and filmed by their production company Century 21 Productions for ITC Entertainment. The series' penultimate episode, it was written by Tony Barwick and first broadcast on 5 May 1968 on ATV London.Set in 2068, the series depicts a \"war of nerves\" between Earth and the Mysterons: a hostile race of Martians with the ability to create functioning copies of destroyed people or objects and use these reconstructions to carry out specific acts of aggression against humanity. Earth is defended by a military organisation called Spectrum, whose top agent, Captain Scarlet, was murdered by the Mysterons and replaced with a reconstruction that later broke free of their control. The double of Scarlet has powers of self-repair that enable him to recover from injuries that would be fatal to any other person, which make him Spectrum's greatest asset in its fight against the Mysterons.\n\"Attack on Cloudbase\" begins with Spectrum fighter pilot Symphony Angel being forced to eject into the Sahara when her aircraft is damaged. Later, a fleet of Mysteron spacecraft enter Earth's atmosphere and launch a devastating assault on Spectrum's airborne headquarters, Cloudbase. Filmed in late 1967, the episode underwent a number of script changes prior to shooting. Gerry Anderson chose Ken Turner to direct due to its unusual nature of the story. The episode presented Century 21's special effects team with several technical challenges, including a scene in which a miniature Angel aircraft overflies the puppet of Symphony Angel in the same shot. For the attack sequence, only a small number of spacecraft models were made; flashing light bulbs were placed in the backdrop as a cost-effective way to create the illusion of a larger fleet. Series composer Barry Gray wrote a full score after Anderson decided that none of the incidental music in Century 21's library suited the episode's grim tone.\nCritical response to \"Attack on Cloudbase\" has been mostly positive, with one commentator naming it the best episode of Captain Scarlet. Some criticism has been directed at its ending plot twist. Anderson, who likened the episode to a black comedy, praised Barwick for his \"humanised\" writing of the puppet characters. In 1980, the New York office of ITC re-edited the episode to form the ending part of the Captain Scarlet compilation film Captain Scarlet vs. the Mysterons."

On the ground, she is overcome by heat stroke and passes out. In a transmission from Mars, the Mysterons warn Spectrum that they intend to destroy its airborne headquarters, Cloudbase.\nCloudbase is placed on red alert and isolated from all external contact. Destiny Angel has been launched to search for Symphony but is recalled by base commander Colonel White in view of the Mysteron threat. This leads to a heated exchange between White and Captain Blue, who admits that he has romantic feelings for Symphony. However, White refuses to let Blue join the ground search.\nNight falls, and Captain Magenta detects a large object on Cloudbase's radar. Rhapsody Angel is launched to investigate and discovers a spinning Mysteron spacecraft that destroys her fighter in mid-air. When more craft arrive, Captain Scarlet volunteers to challenge the Mysterons in Destiny's place. However, his fighter is damaged and he crash-lands on the Cloudbase flight deck, seriously injured.\nAs the Mysterons open fire on Cloudbase, medical officer Dr Fawn is killed. Posing as his assistant, Mysteron agent Captain Black reports that Scarlet's powers of self-repair have failed him and that he is therefore permanently dead. The Mysteron attack intensifies, resulting in the deaths of everyone else on board except White, Blue and Lieutenant Green. As the stricken Cloudbase loses altitude, another explosion kills Green and cripples Blue. Resolving to go down with his command, White stands to attention and salutes, as Cloudbase crashes to Earth. \nSuddenly, Symphony wakes up in the desert facing Scarlet and Blue, who are part of the ground forces that have been sent to rescue her; Symphony merely dreamt the attack on Cloudbase in a nightmare brought on by the desert heat."

        "content": "\"Attack on Cloudbase\" was one of the last Captain Scarlet episodes to be filmed. It was directed by Ken Turner, whose style Gerry Anderson thought best suited the episode's \"more bizarre\" tone. As originally scripted, Captain Magenta's role was to be played by a Spectrum officer codenamed Captain Sienna. This character was replaced with Magenta to avoid the cost of making a new sienna-coloured Spectrum uniform.Filming began on 25 October 1967, less than three weeks before Joe 90, Century 21's next series, entered production. To avoid overworking the designers, who were busy preparing for the new series, the episode was devised as a bottle show to reduce the number of puppets and sets required: unique among Captain Scarlet episodes, it features no characters other than the regular cast and was filmed mostly on existing sets. The previously unseen Cloudbase Radar Room was created using walls and props that were originally built for Thunderbirds Are Go (1966) and earlier Captain Scarlet episodes. \"Attack on Cloudbase\" is also one of only two episodes (the other being \"Flight to Atlantica\") to feature all of the regular cast, though not all of them have speaking parts.\nThe scenes of Symphony Angel in the desert and the Mysterons attacking Cloudbase presented a number of challenges for Century 21's special effects department, headed by Derek Meddings. A scene in which Symphony looks up as Destiny Angel's fighter flies past her required close collaboration between the puppet operators and the effects crew, the former keeping the puppet under control while the latter moved the scale model across the set. The Mysteron spacecraft were modelled on \"flying saucer\" UFOs commonly reported during the 1960s. To make the spacecraft appear to spin in the moonlight, Meddings added \"veins\" to each model to reflect the lighting in the studio. Due to a shortage of model operators on set, the models were flown only in the foreground; flashing light bulbs were fitted to the backdrop to give the impression of a larger fleet.Actress Liz Morgan, who voiced Destiny and Rhapsody Angels, was overcome with emotion at one point during the dialogue-recording session: \"It was a moment when Destiny was very worried about Captain Scarlet and she was making impassioned pleas for him. Well, I started to cry, and immediately a voice came down from the recording booth and [producer] Reg Hill, who was directing that particular week, said, 'No, Liz, love. Do it again, love. Puppets don't cry!'\" Just before Cloudbase hits the ground, Colonel White is shown standing to attention and saluting in a spiralling freeze-frame shot. Anderson based this on maritime tradition, stating that he wanted the audience to see White \"[going] down like the captain of a big ship.\"\"Attack on Cloudbase\" is one of only a few Captain Scarlet episodes to have its own score instead of using incidental music recycled from a track library. Series composer Barry Gray devised the score after Anderson decided that nothing in Century 21's musical archive suited the dark nature of the plot. Performed by a 14-member band, it was the penultimate score to be produced for Captain Scarlet and was recorded on 3 December 1967 in a four-hour studio session. The CD of the series soundtrack includes pieces from \"Attack on Cloudbase\" titled \"Desert Symphony\" and \"The Mysterons Attack!\""

        "content": "In a DVD audio commentary that he recorded for the episode, Anderson stated that although \"Attack on Cloudbase\" was intended to be humorous, he believed that the finished episode was more of a \"black comedy\". He praised the script, noting Blue's feelings for Symphony and his conflict with White as examples of Tony Barwick's \"humanisation\" of the puppet characters. He also described Captain Magenta's comical commentary on the attack, which ends only with the character's death, as another \"wonderful example of 'Barwickism'\". Though acknowledging that dream sequences might seem clich\u00e9d, he defended the episode's use of a nightmare plot mechanism for its power to frighten, and then re-assure, the audience. He argued that the dark tone is lightened by the closing scene, which he said was written as there had to be \"a sequence where everyone was happy together, and clearly no one had come to any grief\", thus forming the \"inevitable happy ending\" to a tragic story.James Stansfield of the website Den of Geek considers \"Attack on Cloudbase\" to be the best episode of Captain Scarlet. Describing the episode as highly entertaining even if \"shocking and surprisingly bleak\", he praises the writing and characterisation \u2013 in particular, the death of Rhapsody Angel and the conflict between Blue and White. However, he comments negatively on the dream plot twist as well as what he regards as a minor plot hole: for reasons that are unclear, the stranded Symphony throws away her helmet, thus making it impossible for Spectrum to contact her. Stansfield suggests that the nightmarish nature of the plot is implied long before it is confirmed in dialogue, suggesting that moments such as the death of the \"indestructible\" Scarlet, and Blue's lack of astonishment at the sudden appearance of Captain Black, serve as \"hints ... that all might not be quite as it seems\". In 2019, British magazine TV Years (a sister publication of TV Choice) listed the attack sequences as the 23rd\u2011greatest moment in TV science fiction, calling the episode \"devastating\" up until the plot twist.Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy calls the episode \"thrilling\" and \"perhaps the highlight\" of the series. However, he criticises the \"lame, 'it was all a dream' ending\", arguing that it is made more frustrating by the fact that the final episode, \"The Inquisition\", is a clip show that ends with the conflict between Earth and the Mysterons unresolved: \"Cut the final few minutes from 'Attack on Cloudbase' and imagine what a finale that would have been!\" Andrew Thomas of Dreamwatch magazine considers dream sequences an \"appalling\" narrative technique but describes the episode's scenes of destruction as \"very well handled\".Martin Cater of Network Distributing judges the episode \"dramatic\" and \"memorable\" despite its dependence on a \"cop-out\" dream sequence. He compares it to the Fireball XL5 episode \"A Day in the Life of a Space General\" (1963), which features an \"orgy of destruction with the convenient cop-out of a dream to act as a 'reset button'.\" Chris Drake and Graeme Bassett describe \"Attack on Cloudbase\" as \"tense and exciting\", stating that it is \"guaranteed to keep the viewer guessing\". Some commentators have questioned why no explanation is given for the explosion that brings down Symphony's fighter at the start of the episode.The British Board of Film Classification certifies the episode U, noting that it contains \"very mild fantasy\" violence."

Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown), codenamed \"Three Kids\", who is too busy talking to her kids on the phone to focus on the battle, and Jeff (Joel McHale), codenamed \u201cWingman\u201d. Jeff shoots down Destro's plane, but takes things too far when he shoots out Destro's parachute. A surprised Destro falls to his death, causing Flint and the rest of the Joes to stare in horror.\nWingman, Three Kids, Buzzkill, and Tight Ship are charged with violence, suggestive language, and mature situations unbecoming of G.I. Joe at a court-martial presided over by Duke (Michael Bell), Flint, and Scarlett (Mary McDonald-Lewis). Wingman defends the first killing in G.I. Joe history by countering it should be their duty to eliminate Cobra because it is a ruthless terrorist organization, but the four are sent to jail.\nIn the jail, the Group meets \"Fourth Wall\", played by Abed (Danny Pudi), in the adjacent cell. Fourth Wall explains that they are in a cartoon and that he has infiltrated a Cobra dig site called \"Greendale\". Wingman loses consciousness, sending him to a live-action, mock G.I.

Joe.\nMeanwhile, at Cobra Headquarters, Cobra Commander (Rob Schrab) delivers a eulogy at Destro's funeral. He is interrupted by \"Vice Cobra Assistant Commander\", played by Dean Pelton (Jim Rash), who delivers news of an energy surge at the Greendale site. Cobra then initiates an attack of the G.I. Joe base to avenge Destro's death. Cobra bombs a hole in Wingman's jail cell, allowing the Group to escape. Wingman tries to help out in the battle, but he just ends up killing more Cobra soldiers and accidentally setting Lifeline on fire, causing him to burn to death. The Squad leaves in a \u201cSubmachopter\u201d tiltrotor and Fourth Wall suggests going to the site at Greendale. The mention of the word causes Wingman to lose consciousness again, sending him into another live-action G.I. Joe action figure commercial where the Squad is now called \u201cThe Mutineers\u201d because of Wingman's fatal sharpshooting skills. Wingman regains consciousness and the Mutineers arrive at the Greendale site.\nThe Mutineers easily defeat opposition and enter Study Room F, where Wingman realizes that he works at Greendale as a teacher named Jeff Winger, and that this cartoon reality is in his imagination. Jeff leaves to go to his office and realizes why he is unconscious \u2013 because he drank the bottle of Scotch whiskey and took anti-aging pills from Koreatown. He returns to the group and explains that he took them because he has been lying about his age. Fourth Wall informs him of the different layers of existence, where he is currently in the 1980s cartoon layer. He explains that Jeff sees visions of the next layer, the toy commercial plane, which separates him from the real world where Jeff must go to confront the reason for the hallucination. Jeff says he doesn't want to go back because he doesn't want to be a middle-aged community college teacher; he wants to be in G.I. Joe because he is immortal in this cartoon world.\nJust then, Cobra and G.I. Joe forces intervene to reveal they have joined forces to become \"Jo-Bra\" and capture Wingman, as his ability to kill means that he is the biggest threat to both of them. Cobra Commander and Duke ask Jeff questions about real life that make Jeff realize he cannot live in this cartoon universe forever. Jeff tricks them and uses his jet pack to escape the cartoon reality. Jeff leaves the toy commercial layer and enters reality where he is on a hospital bed, surrounded by the members of the Save Greendale committee. Jeff reveals that he's 40 years old, to no surprise of the group; as they were aware that he wasn't around his early 30s. It is revealed that Jeff took Korean anti-aging pills to appear younger which land him in the hospital. They nevertheless support him and say he should not have been embarrassed to reveal his age. The group gives him a present of a coffee mug they bought at the hospital gift shop that says \"It's a Old Boy\", with the \"Old\" written in. He tells them to bring it in for a hug and they all laugh while the camera fades to black.\nThe animated end scene shows Buzzkill catching two kids spray-painting their names onto a park structure. She botches a Public Service Announcement and gives a cynically complex message before Fourth Wall intervenes to give a short message: \"Graffiti is bad. Go play sports.\""

        "content": "The episode was animated in the style of the popular 1980s television cartoon, G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero. Jeff, as \"Wingman,\" adopted the look of G.I. Joe's Duke, though with inverted colors for his costume; Annie, as \"Tight Ship,\" was an analogue to Shipwreck; Abed's \"Fourth Wall\" was an homage to the Native American G.I. Joe, Spirit; Shirley, as \"Three Kids,\" wore Stalker's costume; Professor Duncan, as \"Xim-Xam\" (and his twin \"Mix-Max\"), was an homage to the Crimson Guard Twins; Professor Hickey as \"Major Dick,\" with an eye-patch and costume to that of Major Bludd; Chang, as \"Overkill\" wore Quick Kick's costume; and Dean Pelton, as \"Vice Cobra Assistant Commander\", served as a foil to Cobra Commander. During the courtroom scene in Wingman's trial, Scud from Scud: The Disposable Assassin is seen in the background. Fourth Wall's illustration of the layers of reality is a reference to the 1st edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Deities & Demigods/Legends & Lore book. The hospital scene where the group laughs and the camera fades to black pays tribute to the light-hearted endings of G.I. Joe cartoons. The end-credits Public Service Announcement by Buzzkill and Fourth Wall is a reference to a PSA from the original G.I. Joe cartoon, as well as the 35 overall PSAs done in the series."

        "content": "Series creator and co-showrunner Dan Harmon initially announced that there would be an animated episode during the cast and crew's visit to the San Diego Comic-Con in July 2013.  Series writer and co-showrunner Chris McKenna said the idea for the concept of the episode came about in a simple way: \"I think Harmon said, 'Let's do a G.I. Joe episode!'\" McKenna said that the show wanted to pay tribute to the 1980s animated series: \"[G.I. Joe] was something from our childhood that was very important to us and we had fond memories of it, and we thought it would be a cool way to do another animated episode. Like all Community episodes, it takes on a certain style. This one has a very specific story reason for it. I don\u2019t want to give too much away, but our characters find themselves on a Wizard of Oz-type journey through the world of G.I. Joe. \u2026 There\u2019s a mystery that Jeff in particular has to get to the bottom of.\" McKenna added that the Community team had been working overtime to craft \"a loving homage to the G.I. Joe series.\"Though production for the live-action episodes had been completed in December 2013, the cast recorded their voices in late March 2014.  McKenna said the delay was due to the fact that they broke and re-broke the story several times in order to utilize all the regulars and guest stars in the Community universe, as well as to find a proper justification for using the animated medium to tell their story.  McKenna said that Rob Schrab (Scud: The Disposable Assassin) was the \"perfect person\" to direct the episode and \"he's absolutely a maniac trying to get it together.\" McKenna explained that this episode is not simply a sketch, but that the characters take on this style to carry out a story that takes place in the real world, which Harmon stated was a story was about \"age and dying.\"The episode was animated by Harmon's animation studio, Starburns Industries, which had previously animated the claymation episode, \"Abed's Uncontrollable Christmas\". Original G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero cast members Michael Bell and Bill Ratner reprised their roles as Duke and Flint respectively for the episode.\nThe episode was animated with the permission of the G.I. Joe's toy manufacturer, Hasbro. Harmon had this to say about Hasbro's willingness to lend its iconic style:\n\n\"The weird thing was how cooperative they were. Not that we maligned their product in any way, but their product is a syndicated, children's cartoon with a different rating than ours, so it's like part of the point of the episode is that there's a different sensibility within this world. So I thought they'd have more problems than they did with the idea of Jeff Winger's G.I. Joe character accidentally killing people. But they were cool with that! More power to them, because they were very, very gracious with their product. That's really cool too, because you're accustomed in TV that if someone pulls out a Snickers bar, it always says 'Snookers.' So the weird thing is that when you see actual branding like that, it hits your brain like it's kind of revolutionary. Which is dumb, because why should that be? But you see the G.I. Joe logo and we have G.I. Joe characters talking to our characters\u2026\""

To make things worse, Liz is summoned to jury duty and cannot avoid it despite claiming to be Princess Leia. When she leaves for jury duty, she does not leave anyone in charge and allows the staff to go without direction\u2014until later when she puts NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) in charge after learning that the staff have gotten out of hand. Liz is on a court case about a woman, named Rochelle Gaulke (Jackie Hoffman), whose work life and frustrations parallel her own; the two both have employees named Tracy and Jenna, both believe their employees waste their time, and make their lives difficult.\nMeanwhile, Jenna, worn out from working on TGS during the day and on her unlicensed Janis Joplin biopic at night, visits Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell) for help so she can work on both. He gives Jenna a military-grade experimental drug currently being tested on rats to stay awake. At the same time, Tracy believes that having enough money to pay FCC fines means that he can say anything on television, and he says to Liz, \"I can even say what Ernest Borgnine whispered to me.\" As a result, Tracy curses on The Martha Stewart Show, and after learning that the show's advertisers are pulling out, due to his actions, decides to sponsor the show.

After their unsuccessful attempts, Kenneth suggests \"The Funcooker\" which Jack decides is the perfect name.\nBack at the studios, the taping of TGS is interrupted by Dr. Spaceman who desperately forces Jenna to sleep because she might die like one of his test rats.

It is the first episode of a two-part story, the second episode being \"Cold Blood\", and features the return of the Silurians, a reptile-like humanoid race last seen in 1984's Warriors of the Deep.\nIn the episode a drilling operation headed by Nasreen Chaudhry (Meera Syal) in 2020 Wales is drilling deep into the earth and disrupting a civilisation of Silurians who dwell beneath the earth. In turn, the Silurians open holes in the ground to experiment on one villager, Mo (Alun Raglan), and hold Mo's son Elliot (Samuel Davies) hostage. After the Silurian Alaya (Neve McIntosh) is subdued in Wales, there is a stalemate between the two settlements as both sides have a hostage.\nExecutive producers Steven Moffat and Piers Wenger contacted Chibnall and asked him to write a two-part episode involving Silurians and a drill. Moffat wished to redesign the Silurians and worked together with Chibnall to create the idea of distinguishing prosthetics for their faces. Being in the fourth production block of the series, the episode was filmed in October and November 2009, with location filming in Llanwynno, Wales. McIntosh then returned in the series as a recurrent actress, portraying Madame Vastra, another Silurian character. The episode was watched by 6.49 million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD and received mixed reviews from critics.

The short then focuses to the present day and reveals the pigs now play modern instruments and perform as The Three Little Bops.\nDuring a Bops gig at the House of Straw, the Big Bad Wolf shows up, demonstrates that he is friendly by shaking hands and states that he wants to sit in with the band. He immediately shows he is a terrible trumpet player, however, so the pigs, labelling him a square, throw him out. Insulted, the Wolf retaliates by using the trumpet to blow down the House of Straw, forcing the pigs to go to the Dew Drop Inn, the House of Sticks.\nThings go well (including the piano playing pig doing an imitation of Liberace's \"I wish my brother George was here\"), until the Wolf arrives and sits in again. The audience calls for the pigs to \"throw the square out\", which they do. The Wolf retaliates by blowing down the Dew Drop Inn. The pigs then realize that to escape the Wolf's \"windy tricks\", they must become the band of choice at the House of Bricks (built on May 1, 1776, according to a cornerstone).\nThe House of Bricks has a \"No Wolves Allowed\" rule, so when the Wolf tries to get in, he is punched in the face by a bouncer. He then unsuccessfully tries to ram the door down with a log. The Wolf falls back on trying to use his trumpet to blow down the building, but soon runs out of breath.\nHe decides that disguising himself will allow him to successfully get in, so he reenters in fur coat, playing on a ukulele a perfect rendition of the Charleston (cut short when the piano player pig recognizes him and tosses a banana peel). The Wolf returns, hidden inside a houseplant. He pops up and begins playing his trumpet, but the pig playing the double bass fires a plunger off the strings and blasts the Wolf out of the building.  For his third try, the Wolf shows up in a drum major outfit playing a big bass drum to the tune of \"Don't Give Up the Ship\". The Bops' drummer throws a dart and deflates the bass drum. Humiliated, the Wolf leaves. The pigs shut and lock the door to ensure he cannot get in again.\nNot the least bit deterred, he shows up with a large cylinder of TNT and snaps, \"I'll show those pigs that I'm not stuck!  If I can't blow it down, I'll blow it up!\" The fuse is blown out by one of the pigs, so the Wolf carries the cylinder a few feet away from the door to light it a second time. He has moved too far away, though, and as he is carrying it back to the door of the building, it explodes and the Wolf is killed.\nThe narrator reveals that the explosion that killed the Wolf did not send him to Heaven but down to \"the other place\", where his trumpet playing improves. When the pigs hear this, one of them says, \"The Big Bad Wolf, he learned the rule: you gotta get hot to play real cool!\" The Wolf's spirit then rises up through the floor and, now playing expertly, joins in for the final notes, prompting the pigs to alter their band's name to \"The Three Little Bops Plus One\"."

In the book, professor of musicology Daniel Goldmark writes, \"Three Little Bops is a return to the swinging sounds that once dominated the Warner Bros. cartoons. Los Angeles boasted a thriving jazz scene in the 1950s, so not only was the studio able to feature trumpeter Shorty Rogers, it also made great use of comedian (and voice artist) Stan Freberg as the cartoon's hep narrator. The entire cartoon is told in scatlike rhyme, and the pigs really play some smokin' jazz \u2014 as does the wolf once he finally gets 'hot' down in hell.\""

        "content": "Didi Pickles is pregnant with her second baby, which makes her son Tommy worry how that will change the family dynamic. The birth comes unexpectedly early, and Didi gives birth to a boy named Dil. Upon bringing him home, she and her husband Stu struggle to cope with Dil's constant outbursts. Tommy finds his new brother hard to get along with, but Stu assures him that one day, he will be happy to have Dil in the family, and Tommy accepts his newfound responsibility as an older brother.\nWith Dil still causing problems at the Pickles' home, Phil and Lil suggest using the Reptar Wagon Stu has built for a toy contest in Japan to take him back to the hospital. As Tommy and Chuckie argue with Phil and Lil, Angelica walks in, telling the babies to be quiet. In the process, Dil snatches her Cynthia doll from her. She fights Dil to get the doll back and accidentally kicks the Reptar wagon, which begins to drive away with the babies on board. They speed recklessly through the streets and land in the back of a van, which crashes in the woods. Angelica shows no concern until she finds out that the babies have taken her Cynthia doll, which prompts her to take the family dog, Spike, to find them and retrieve Cynthia.\nTommy leads the babies toward a ranger's cabin, believing it to be the home of a magic \"lizard\" (a mispronunciation of wizard) who can grant their wish to go home. On the way, they encounter monkeys who hijacked a crashed circus train. They kidnap Dil, and Tommy's friends refuse to help rescue him, believing they are better off without him. Tommy sets off after his brother alone. Meanwhile, the family discovers the babies are missing and set out to find them in the face of the media sensation that has suddenly generated around their children's disappearance. Drew and Charlotte arrive and Drew learns from Rex Pester that his brother lost Angelica, causing Drew to attack Stu.\nTommy eventually finds Dil during a storm, but as he struggles to take care of him, Dil continues acting selfishly. Tommy eventually loses his temper and prepares to pour Mash Banana Baby food onto Dil for the monkeys to take him again, but his rage and the storm scares Dil into ending his behavior and his tears cause Tommy to calm down, and the brothers begin to bond. After the storm passes, they reunite with Phil, Lil, and Chuckie, who, upon having a change of heart, stop the monkeys from trying to take away Tommy and Dil. Angelica recovers her Cynthia doll and reunites with the babies. As they start to cross a damaged bridge, Angelica falls out of the Reptar wagon and hangs through a gap in the bridge above a raging river. They are confronted by the monkeys, only to be scared off by a wolf, who attempts to attack the babies until Spike intervenes and fights the wolf, falling in the process.\nStu, looking for the babies in a pterodactyl-like glider, sees them from above and crash lands into the ranger's cabin. Believing he is the \"lizard,\" the babies ask him to bring Spike back instead of going home. Stu falls through the bridge and reveals Spike, who survived the fall by landing in the struts of the bridge. The children are reunited with their parents and return home."

        "content": "Talks about making Rugrats into a feature film existed since the beginning of the series. The first attempt was in May 1993, when Nickelodeon made a two-year contract deal with 20th Century Fox to produce new material, but an unnamed Nickelodeon executive did not rule out the possibility to make films based on their existing properties, one of those that was proposed was Rugrats, alongside Doug and The Ren & Stimpy Show. However, in 1994, Nickelodeon's parent company Viacom acquired Paramount Pictures, and Paramount would distribute the films instead. As a result, the contract from Fox expired, with no films produced (although Doug would eventually receive a theatrical film from Walt Disney Pictures in 1999). Production on The Rugrats Movie started a year later in 1995. The film's voice actors began recording their parts for the movie in late March 1997.Two months before the release of the movie, an episode prequel titled \"The Family Tree\" was aired as the final episode of the fifth season. The film's beginning and ending parody Paramount and Lucasfilm's Indiana Jones film series. This later inspired the second segment of the episode \"A Tale of Two Puppies / Okey-Dokey Jones and the Ring of the Sunbeams\", that aired during the show's eighth season in 2002.\nThis film was the first Rugrats production to use digital ink and paint, rather than the traditional cel animation used in the show.\nTwo songs were cut from the film during production. The first revolves around Stu and Didi in a nightmare sequence where Dr. Lipschitz criticizes their parenting through a song. The second depicts the Rugrats pushing the Reptar Wagon through the woods, debating what to do about Dil in an army chant style song. These two scenes were cut from the theatrical, VHS, DVD, Laserdisc, Blu-ray, and Paramount+ releases. However, these scenes are shown on CBS and Nickelodeon television airings of the film. These scenes were also present in the print novelization.\nThe film was released in theaters with a CatDog short titled \"Fetch\". This short was later broadcast in CatDog Episode 21. However, the VHS, DVD, Laserdisc, and Blu-ray releases contains a different CatDog short from Episode 28 titled \"Winslow's Home Videos\"."

Upon arriving at his quarters, the housekeeper warns him that their last priest prematurely aged while there. His duties include overseeing a nun-run, run-down inner-city school.\nThe first time Father O'Malley has been responsible for a school, he's nervous he must address the large group of nuns. While he's trying to make some opening remarks, they continually giggle which disconcerts him. Finally he discovers a playful kitten was upstaging him.\nGetting a tour by Sister Superior Mary Benedict, O'Malley is to recommend whether or not the school should be closed and the children sent to another school with modern facilities. However, the sisters feel that God will provide for them and put their hopes in Horace P. Bogardus, a businessman who has constructed a modern building next door to the school on land he had bought from them. They are hoping he will donate it to them.\nFather O'Malley and the dedicated but stubborn Sister Benedict, both wish to save the school, but their different views and methods often lead to disagreements. The Father has admitted eighth-grade student, Patsy of Syracuse, New York, whom the parish has taken in while her mother attempts to get back on her feet. He is told that, although she had been married to the father, the musician had gone to Cincinnati but broke his promise to send for her.\nWhen Patsy falls behind, Benedict questions O'Malley, concerned about her background. Respecting the mother's privacy, he deflects her questions.\nThey have another clash involving student Eddie, who is being bullied by another, newer student. Concerned, the former tomboy although at first teaching the children to turn the other cheek, decides to teach him boxing from a manual.\nThe Father \"coaches\" Patsy to be original in a paper for Sister Benedict, earning her a high mark. When the bully next trips Eddie, the Sister coaches from the sidelines, and not only does he hold his own, but he makes peace and offers friendship to him.\nThey plant a seed of an idea to Mr. Bogardus. After being shown around the building, they point out that his donation of the building to the school would be his great legacy. Later, when he gets worked up over another costly delay, his doctor points out the stress is bad for his heart.\nFather O'Malley surprises Patsy's mother with a reunion with her estranged husband. He found him via the musicians' union, as he's a musician. They reconcile, surprising Patsy when she sees them kiss, who had come to show her mother her graduation dress.\nAt her exams, Patsy is upset. The Father visits Sister Benedict, who tells him her marks are too low to pass. When he tries to convince her to pass her anyway, they butt heads. He points out the self-esteem issues that come with failing and talks about a very successful business owner in town who had had difficulties at school.\nMr. Bogardus, convinced by his doctor that doing so will prolong his life, starts to do selfless acts. He gives a blind beggar money, helps an older woman to get on the bus, adopts a homeless dog and ultimately gives the sisters his building for the school.\nPatsy is finally introduced to the man she had seen kissing her mother, her father. She admits to sister Benedict that she intentionally failed her exams so she could be held back a year and stay with Sister Benedict. Patsy demonstrates knowing the material that was on the exam. Knowing this, Sister Benedict allows Patsy to graduate.\nPreparations are being made with getting the new building set, and Sister Benedict enthusiastically oversees setting up the new facility. Unfortunately, Father O'Malley has to break the news that her placement has changed.\nAs Sister Benedict contracted tuberculosis, the physician recommends to Father O'Malley that she be transferred to a dry climate with non-parochial duties, but without telling her the reason. She assumes the transfer is because of her disagreements with O'Malley and struggles to understand the reasons for the path set out for her. Just before Sister Benedict departs, Father O'Malley reveals the true reason for her temporary transfer, and she then leaves happily, looking forward to her return."

The acting of the entire cast is excellent.

The ship mysteriously reappears in orbit around Neptune, and the rescue vessel Lewis and Clark is dispatched to investigate. Its crew\u2014Captain Miller, second-in-command Lieutenant Starck, pilot Smith, medical technician Peters, engineer Ensign Justin, doctor D.J., and rescue technician Cooper\u2014is joined by Dr. William Weir, the Event Horizon's designer. He briefs them on the ship's experimental gravity drive with a simple visualization of how it folds space-time. The distress signal consists of a series of screams and howls, but D.J. believes he hears the Latin phrase \"Liberate me\" (\"Save me\").\nUpon boarding the Event Horizon, the crew finds evidence of a massacre. As they search for survivors, the ship's gravity drive activates and briefly pulls Justin into a portal while also causing a shock wave that damages the Lewis and Clark. The crew are forced to board the Event Horizon while Justin emerges in a catatonic state. Smith and Cooper are sent on a spacewalk to repair the hull of the Lewis and Clark.\nThe crew begins experiencing hallucinations corresponding to their fears and regrets. Miller sees a subordinate he was forced to abandon to his death; Peters sees her son with his legs covered in bloody lesions; Weir sees an eyeless vision of his late wife urging him to join her. Justin attempts suicide by decompression, but he is saved by Miller. The crew places Justin in stasis. They discover a video log of the Event Horizon's crew fornicating and mutilating each other shortly after first engaging the gravity drive. The log ends with a shot of the Event Horizon's captain, holding his own eyes gouged from their sockets and speaking the Latin phrase from the earlier distress call. D.J. translates the complete phrase as \"Libera te tutemet ex inferis\" (\"Save yourself from hell\").Weir explains that the ship's drive opened a gateway to a hellish dimension (implied to be Hell) outside the known universe, and that the Event Horizon has attained sentience. Miller decides to destroy it. He orders an evacuation while Peters is lured to her death by a hallucination of her son. Weir, who has gouged out his own eyes and is possessed by the evil presence, uses an explosive device to destroy the Lewis and Clark which kills Smith and blasts Cooper into space. Weir kills D.J. by vivisecting him and corners Starck on the bridge. Miller confronts Weir, who overpowers him and initiates a 10-minute countdown to activate the gravity drive and return to the other dimension.\nCooper uses his space suit's oxygen supply to propel himself back to the ship and appears at the bridge window. Weir shoots at him, shattering the window, causing Weir to be blown into space by the decompression. Miller, Starck and Cooper survive and manage to seal off the ship's bridge. With their own ship destroyed, Miller plans to split the Event Horizon in two with explosives and use its forward section as a lifeboat. He is attacked by hallucinations which turn out to be the resurrected and further mutilated Weir. Miller fights him off and detonates the explosives, sacrificing himself.\nThe gravity drive activates, pulling the ship's stern section into a black hole. Starck and Cooper enter stasis beside a comatose Justin and wait to be rescued. Seventy-two days later, the wreckage of the Event Horizon is boarded by a rescue party who discover the survivors in stasis. Starck sees Weir posing as one of the rescuers and screams in terror, but she awakens and realizes that it was a nightmare. Cooper and the rescue team try to calm the terrified Starck as the doors close."

After the show, Drexel makes a deal with Petroff, offering him $15,000 ($288,187 in 2021 dollars) as a fee for his appearance at a private party. Not knowing of this new arrangement, Allen is especially insulted by one final publicity stunt, fires Petroff, and flees with devoted manservant Botts, first to his hometown in New Mexico, then to his secluded cabin in the Sierra Madres. Neither Petroff nor Botts can convince him to return to his life as a public figure, forcing Drexel to set out in her own private plane to find him.\nDrexel confronts Allen in the Sierra Madres, where she fails to convince him to return, but does attract his romantic interest. The two spend a tense but romantically charged weekend together, until a misunderstanding compels Cynthia to hastily leave. Now intrigued, Allen returns to Chicago with her belongings. He finds Drexel furious; she criticizes his singing and (falsely) tells him she has no romantic interest in him, as she is engaged to Count Du Rienne. Cynthia sues him for breach of contract, but in court Anthony argues that he refused to sing for her because of her lack of appreciation for his talent, and the case is dismissed. Drexel and Allen, each of whom have realized the depth of their feelings for each other, arrange to meet outside the courtroom. Allen conceals himself in a doorway, and when Drexel walks by, he pulls her inside and proceeds to viciously spank her. They emerge a happy couple. Petroff calls a press conference at which he announces their union, and the couple signs their marriage license."

Zanuck assigned him to the film, a remake of the Spanish language release Las fronteras del amor, which Frank R. Strayer had directed for Fox two years earlier. Zanuck had opera baritone Lawrence Tibbett under contract, and following the commercial failure of the high-budget Metropolitan in 1935, he was anxious to rid himself of the singer and thought Preminger could serve as his hatchet man. Tibbett was aware of Zanuck's feelings and didn't blame the director, who was anxious to helm a film, for accepting the assignment, and he proved to be amiable both on and off the set.Filming began under the title Love Flight in mid-August 1936, soon after Preminger filed his Declaration of Intention to become a naturalized American citizen. Well under budget and ahead of schedule, principal photography was completed on September 15, and Zanuck was so pleased with Preminger's efficiency he signed him to a one-year contract at $1,000 per week, effective October 6. Prior to the film's release, its title was changed to Under Your Spell, after one of three songs Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz had written for the score, the other two being \"My Little Mule Wagon\" and \"Amigo.\" Tibbet also performed \"Largo al factotum\" from The Barber of Seville and \"Le veau d'or\" from Faust in the film, which proved to be his last.\nThe film opens with a lengthy tracking shot in a recording studio that established Preminger's preference for allowing camera movement to bind together all the elements of a scene. In another sequence, set during a trial, the director presaged his 1959 film Anatomy of a Murder with his use of loud, overlapping dialogue to create a sense of courtroom reality.The film was a remake of the American Spanish-language film, Las fronteras del amor."

When General Fitts visits the post with his daughter Kit on their way to Manila, Dick is assigned to drive her to a reception that evening. Falling victim to the moonlit night, Kit and Dick attend a luau instead, and he sings Aloha \u2018Oe. They are discovered in each other's arms by Scrapper and Lieutenant Biddle, who is also in love with Kit. Biddle accuses Dick of ruining Kit's reputation and forcing her to accompany him off post. Dick decides to desert. Scrapper begs Kit to straighten things out with Biddle.\nTo prevent Dick from deserting, Kit tells him that she was responding to a crazy impulse and he means nothing to her. Stung by her words, and Biddle's condescending statement that \"if you were an officer and a gentleman, you'd understand,\" Dick decides to compete with Biddle as an equal and applies for West Point. He is accepted and does very well, to Scrapper's delight. In his First Class year, Dick becomes First Captain and General Fitts is appointed Academy superintendent, with Biddle present as his aide. While most of his classmates are infatuated with Kit, Dick is cold to her. Consequently, he is not very happy when the rest of the men insist that she participate in the traditional \"Hundredth Night\" theatrical performance that he is to direct.\nDick writes a comedy about a female general with a message directed at Kit. After the first rehearsal, Kit walks with Dick on Flirtation Walk and tries to explain why she told him she was not in love with him. Dick is too angry to listen to Kit, but during their on-stage love scene kisses her, and she admits she loves him. When, near graduation, General Fitts announces Kit's engagement to Biddle, Dick naturally is confused, and visits her after lights out to talk her out of marrying Biddle. He is caught by Biddle and, at Biddle's suggestion, agrees to resign from the Academy to protect Kit's name. Scrapper arrives at the Academy to see Dick graduate and is disappointed to learn of his resignation. The day is saved when Biddle tells Dick that his resignation was not accepted and that Kit returned his ring, wishing him good luck. Dick graduates a happy man."

To purchase a one-of-a-kind pop-up book of London in Samuel Gruber's antique shop for his aunt Lucy's 100th birthday, Paddington performs several odd jobs and saves his wages, but he later witnesses a burglary at the shop in which the book is stolen. Paddington gives chase, but the thief escapes, and Paddington is framed and arrested. The thief returns home and is revealed to be Phoenix Buchanan, an egotistical actor who also lives in Windsor Gardens. In court, Mr. Gruber states that he does not believe that Paddington stole the book. However, with no evidence of the thief's existence, Paddington is convicted and sent to prison.\nPaddington is assigned to laundry duty on his first day, but accidently puts a red sock in with the white prison suits which turns them pink, angering the prisoners. The prison's short-tempered chef, Knuckles McGinty, recruits Paddington after being impressed by his marmalade sandwich recipe. The Browns work to clear Paddington's name, putting up sketches of the thief all over London. Buchanan uses the book to locate a series of clues within London's landmarks, which unveil the location of a secret treasure. During their efforts to prove Paddington's innocence, the Browns encounter a fortune teller who informs them that the book leads to the hidden fortune of the original author.\nWith Paddington's influence, the prison becomes a much livelier and friendlier place, but Paddington struggles to remain positive when the Browns are unable to prove his innocence, but keep hunting. Knuckles and two other prisoners, Phibs and Spoon, later tell Paddington that although the Browns mean well, they will eventually forget about him.\nBecoming convinced that Buchanan is the culprit, the Browns look for the stolen book inside his house. They find a secret attic where Buchanan's various costumes are stashed, including the disguise he wore to steal the book. Meanwhile, the Browns' investigation causes them to miss visiting Paddington in prison.\nPaddington, believing the Browns have forgotten him, joins Knuckles, Phibs and Spoon in a prison break. They promise to aid in proving his innocence, but after escaping, they promptly abandon the idea in order to flee the country, inviting Paddington to join them. Paddington refuses and, while avoiding the police, uses a public telephone to contact the Browns, who assert that Buchanan is the real culprit. To catch Buchanan, they arrange to meet at Paddington Station, where a carnival train carrying the hidden fortune is due to leave.\nPaddington reaches the station, hides in a litter bin to avoid the police, and boards the train just as it leaves. The Browns pursue on a LNER Peppercorn Class A1, at the opposite platform. Buchanan finds the hidden fortune, but is thwarted by Paddington. Henry, Judy and Mrs. Bird catch up and board the other train to confront Buchanan, who overwhelms them and escapes. He severs the coupling of the train's rear carriage (with Paddington locked inside), but is photographed by Judy while holding the book, before Henry knocks him out.\nPaddington is still trapped in the rear carriage when it derails and crashes into a nearby river. Mary tries to rescue Paddington, but struggles to open the locked carriage; she is soon assisted by Knuckles, Phibs, and Spoon, who had a change of heart and decide to help Paddington as promised.\nPaddington falls into a coma, but wakes up on Lucy's birthday to find himself at home. He learns that he has been exonerated, and that Buchanan has been arrested. Although Paddington is disappointed that he cannot give Lucy the book as it has been taken in as police evidence, he discovers that the Browns, with the help of their neighbours, arranged for Lucy to come to London herself. Opening the front door to her, Paddington hugs Lucy, wishing her a happy birthday.\nDuring the credits, Knuckles, Phibs, and Spoon are pardoned, and Knuckles opens a sandwich business. Buchanan is sentenced to ten years in prison for his crimes; six months later, he is shown to be putting his experience as a performer to further use by hosting shows for the inmates and providing entertainment throughout the building."

Shortly before the school opens, Martha's aunt, Lily Mortar, arrives and forces her way into a teaching position as a way to continue sponging off Martha.\nKaren and local doctor Joe Cardin begin to date, unaware that Martha is in love with him. One evening, Joe falls asleep in a chair in Martha's room while waiting for Karen to return to the school. He wakes with a start and breaks a glass, which wakes up Mary Tilford. Before he leaves, he casually refers to his and Karen's plans to marry, and Mary watches from the shadows as Martha sobs quietly once she thinks she is alone.\nWhen Karen punishes Mary for missing classes and lying, Mary acts as though she has a pain and falls to the floor in a faint. Although they are not convinced by Mary's performance, Karen and Martha call Joe to examine her. While Joe and Karen are busy with Mary, Martha decides to finally fire Aunt Lily, who is not a good teacher. Lily feels slighted, even though Martha offers to continue to support her, and they have an argument before she goes, during which Lily confronts Martha with her suspicions about the young woman's true feelings for Joe. Martha hears a noise and discovers Rosalie Wells and Evelyn Munn, who are Mary's roommates, listening at the door. Flustered, she accidentally closes the door on Rosalie's arm, slightly injuring her. Back in their room, Evelyn tells Mary about the argument between Martha and Lily.\nFeeling persecuted, Mary decides to run away from the school.

To verify the story, Mary has Amelia talk to Rosalie, who she has brought with her and coerced by threatening to reveal that Rosalie stole another student's bracelet. Mary even says that Martha injured Rosalie's arm intentionally. Amelia is shocked by the revelation of a love triangle between Karen, Joe, and Martha, and alerts the other parents who have girls at the school, all of whom withdraw their daughters.\nThe trio sue Amelia for slander, but they lose their case. Karen and Martha are unable to enroll any new students, and Joe is fired from his job at the hospital. Lily returns, but Martha resents her for not coming back to testify during the case and tells her to leave. Joe asks Karen to come with him to Vienna, where he has gotten a job. She balks when he mentions that Martha is also invited and finally asks if there was ever anything between Martha and him. Unable to fully believe his denial after what she heard in court, she tells him to go to Vienna by himself.\nOnce Joe is gone, Martha admits to Karen that she loves Joe, though she says she never told him, and then gets on the same train as Lily. In passing, Lily mentions having seen Mary and Rosalie with the missing bracelet, and Martha realizes what happened. She gets off the train and convinces Rosalie to tell Amelia the truth. Amelia offers Martha compensation, but Martha refuses, asking only that Amelia take Karen a message from her: \"stay with Joe, wherever he is.\" Martha leaves, Amelia talks to Karen, and Karen goes to Vienna to be with Joe."

        "content": "Lillian Hellman's 1934 play The Children's Hour was inspired by the true story of two Scottish school teachers whose lives were destroyed in 1810 when they were falsely accused by one of their students of engaging in a lesbian relationship. At the time, the mention of homosexuality on stage was illegal in New York State, but authorities chose to overlook the play's subject matter when its Broadway production was acclaimed by critics.Because the Hays Code, which was in effect when the film was produced, would never permit a film to focus on or even hint at lesbianism, Samuel Goldwyn was the only producer interested in purchasing the film rights to the play. He signed Hellman to adapt her play for the screen, and the playwright changed the lie from being that the two school teachers were lovers to it being that one of the teachers had slept with the other's fianc\u00e9. The Hays Office even prevented the use of, or a reference to, the play's original title, so Hellman also changed the title of her script to The Lie; it was not until after principal photography was completed that the film was rechristened These Three.Goldwyn had already cast the three leads when he offered William Wyler, who, until then, had helmed mostly B pictures and Westerns, the opportunity to direct the film, along with a five-year contract. This film was also the 1st of 8 films Wyler and Goldwyn worked together. Although Wyler wasn't completely happy with Goldwyn's casting choices, he accepted the offer, though he insisted on a three-year contract instead. He tried to convince Goldwyn to replace contract player Joel McCrea with Leslie Howard, but the producer refused and, unwisely, told McCrea about Wyler's preference, which led to difficulties between the actor and director during filming.The Lux Radio Theatre aired a one-hour adaptation of the film on December 6, 1937, with Barbara Stanwyck as Martha Dobie, Errol Flynn as Dr. Joe Cardin, Mary Astor as Karen Wright, and Constance Collier as Lily Mortar. Alma Kruger and Marcia Mae Jones reprised their roles from the film as Amelia Tilford and Rosalie Wells, respectively."

        "content": "Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times wrote: \"Miss Hellman's job of literary carpentry is little short of brilliant. Upon the framework of her stage success she has constructed an absorbing, tautly written and dramatically vital screen play. To it, in turn, a gifted cast headed by Merle Oberon, Miriam Hopkins and Joel McCrea has contributed lavishly of its talents, aided by superb direction and exceptionally fine photography. In its totality the picture emerges as one of the finest screen dramas in recent years . . . Strong, turbulent and caustic, These Three is an unusual picture and it has been brought to the screen with perception, beauty and a keen sense of drama.\"The review in Variety said of Bonita Granville and Marcia Mae Jones: \"Theirs are inspired performances.\" It added: \"Hellman, if anything, has improved upon the original in scripting the triangle as a dramatis personae of romantic frustration, three basically wholesome victims of an unwholesome combination of circumstance. McCrea was never better in translating a difficult assignment intelligently and sympathetically. The well bred restraint of Hopkins and Oberon in their travail with the mixture of juvenile emotions at their boarding school is likewise impressive.\"Writing for The Spectator in 1936, Graham Greene observed: \"I have seldom been so moved by any fictional film . . . After ten minutes or so of the usual screen sentiment, quaintness and exaggeration, one began to watch the incredulous pleasure of nothing less than life.\" Greene praised the acting of the protagonists portrayed by Oberon, Hopkins, and, to a lesser extent, McCrea, as well as the \"shocking mastery\" of the performances by Granville and Jones as the antagonists.The review in Film Daily read, in part: \"Tense, dramatic, this is one of the most powerful pictures that has come to the talking screen . . . Miriam Hopkins and Merle Oberon give splendid performances, but it is the work of little Bonita Granville, as the troublemaker, which will attract the most attention.\"John Mosher of The New Yorker wrote that \"quite a good piece of work has been done with this somewhat problematic drama\". He added: \"With all the drastic alterations made in the plot, it is surprising how many of the original episodes and scenes have been retained.\"In the 21st century, TVGuide.com rated the film 4\u00bd out of five stars, calling it \"gripping, adult cinema\" and commenting that \"Oberon gives one of her best dramatic performances and McCrea is also quite fine. The two child actresses have the showiest parts, but the real performances to watch are those of Alma Kruger and Miriam Hopkins. Hopkins, in particular, has rarely been better, her intense, high-strung quality perfectly suited to the role of a woman unable to stop her world from falling apart around her.\""

Ernst Ganz, the elderly Jewish man that Vollmer has had a sympathetic, uncle-like relationship with since he was an abused and neglected kid, offers him shelter and compassion but not respect. Ernst spent nine years in Dachau and recognizes that Vollmer's politics stem from a childish desire for the respect of others. This pains Vollmer, who openly confesses that he views Ernst as a father figure, since his real father physically abused him and his mother was never around.\nBeginning one night, Vollmer is periodically visited by a shadowy figure who teaches him how to enthrall a crowd. The figure teaches Vollmer how to speak, and pays Vollmer's rent at the hall where he holds rallies. He also instructs Vollmer to arrange the death of one of his followers, Nick Bloss, thereby creating a martyr to rally everyone around (a reference to the 1930 murder of Horst Wessel, a low-ranking officer in the Sturmabteilung). Following the figure's instructions and assistance, Vollmer becomes considerably more successful and his group's following grows. Ernst becomes fearful that Vollmer may actually succeed in igniting another Holocaust. He disrupts a rally, accusing Vollmer of being \"nothing but a cheap copy\" of the German F\u00fchrer while Vollmer cowers before his surrogate father.\nAfter the failed rally, the shadowy figure rebukes Vollmer for his failure and says that from now on he will be ordering Vollmer rather than instructing him. Vollmer demands to know who his mysterious benefactor is. The man steps forward from the shadows to reveal himself to be Adolf Hitler. He orders Vollmer to kill Ernst, and Vollmer steels himself enough to complete the task. Hitler congratulates him and asks how it felt; Vollmer replies that he felt immortal. Hitler responds, \"Mr. Vollmer, we are immortal!\"\nPolice officers arrive soon after, to arrest Vollmer for conspiracy to murder Nick. Shot while fleeing, Vollmer is astonished by the sight of his own blood. Hitler's shadow appears on the wall behind the dying Vollmer as he gasps out, \"There's something very wrong here...

She also finds a decapitated teddy bear in her apartment. A police detective, Lt. Dave Madden, whose own wife was raped and murdered, takes a personal interest in Norah and her case. Lt. Madden engages in suspicious behavior such as suggesting to Norah several times that he himself could be the caller, secretly tape recording his discussions with Norah, listening to tapes of Norah and other women talking about obscene phone calls, and obsessively studying pornography and the behavior of sex perverts, despite the fact that he is exposing his ten-year-old daughter to such adult concepts and he is being reported to his superiors at work.\nThe obscene caller is seen to be Lawrence Sherman, a waiter at the nightclub where Norah works. Lawrence lives with and cares for his 19-year-old sister Edie, who is brain damaged and has the mind of a child. Edie's brain damage is apparently the result of an accident when she was a little girl and saw her older brother, Lawrence, having sex with an unidentified older woman; she ran away in horror or fear and fell down the stairs. Lawrence is unable to have a normal romantic or sexual relationship due to his guilt over the accident and his duty to look after Edie following the death of their parents. He is also frustrated when Edie dresses up in an adult dress, high heels and makeup and seems to make advances towards him. He tries to get rid of his frustration by visiting adult bookstores and movies in Times Square, but still is obsessed with watching and calling Norah. Despite Lt. Madden's warnings that the caller might be someone Norah knows, Norah never suspects Lawrence until it is too late.  Instead she is friendly to him and even attracted to him, complimenting him on his body when they meet at the gym, and offering to stay late after work to teach him to dance.\nMarian Freeman, the older, experienced manager of the nightclub where Norah works, also takes a personal interest in Norah and tries to advise and protect her. She offers to spend the night with Norah at her apartment so Norah will not be alone and afraid. While Marian is visiting, Norah receives yet another telephone call and starts to cry. Marian consoles her, but Norah senses that Marian is actually making a lesbian pass at her and, revolted, asks her to leave the apartment immediately. Marian leaves in a huff, still wearing Norah's coat, which she had been using as a bathrobe. Lawrence, who is outside, sees Marian leaving in Norah's coat, and mistaking her for Norah, chases after her and kills her.\nLawrence finally attacks Norah after closing time in the empty nightclub and rapes her, but does not kill her. Lt. Madden, who has just figured out that Lawrence was watching Norah through the reflection of a mirror, arrives too late to prevent the rape. He beats Lawrence and then, inexplicably, lets him leave the club. Lawrence runs through traffic in Times Square imagining that he is running through Central Park towards a welcoming Norah. Police officers chase him and ultimately gun him down as the film ends."

        "content": "The film is partly narrated by Warden Streiger (known as \"Bulldog\" Streiger).\nA bank, temporarily housed in a mobile home while a new building is built, looks like an easy target to break into. That is what Al Karp, the former partner of jailed criminal planner Walter Ballantine, thinks, so Karp arranges for Ballantine to escape from the Streiger Institute (a privately run penitentiary). Ballantine isn't keen on the job, given that the last one, also brought to him by Karp, landed him in jail. Two members of the team aren't also to his liking:  Victor, the nephew of Karp, is a former FBI agent but also absolutely clueless. And the financier of the coup, Eleonora, has got a crush on him. Finally, after seeing the bank, Ballantine is ready to give up. A hold-up is out of question - there isn't a good escape route, and the possibility of being shot in the back when leaving the bank has also to be considered. Because of the opening hours of the nearby stores, on Thursday nights money is kept in the bank. But in a hard-to-crack Mosler safe, guarded by four security guards. So breaking into the bank is also no option.\nAt this moment, Ballantine has a flash of inspiration: Instead of stealing the money out of the bank, they will steal the whole bank. And while Streiger together with his FBI buddy Andrew Constable is setting up a command center to catch Ballantine, the team around Ballantine is getting to work: Since the provisional bank is missing wheels, they have steal a tractor together with wheels, and install them under the bank.\nEverything is going perfectly and according to plan: They stage a diversion to lure the police patrol cars away from the bank and drive away with it. Thanks to trickery, the guards flee the bank in panic. After camouflaging it by giving it a fresh, pink painting instead of the old green one, they hide it in a trailer park, and start to work on the safe. Even when the police controls the site, the only result is the harassment of another mobile home owner, who has also arrived the same night, and whose trailer is green.\nThings begin to go awry when the pink color, not being waterproof, is washed away by a lawn sprinkler, and the manager of the trailer park, not wanting more disturbances, forces them to leave. Without a better option, they park the bank on top of a hill in a wasteland, installing a prominent billboard for real estate development. Resuming the work on the safe, it proves to be a very tough nut. They resort to the use of nitroglycerine, when the mobile home is spotted by a helicopter, and Streiger together with Constable are rushing to the scene. Meanwhile, the team finally blasts open the safe, blowing the roof and the walls of the bank away as collateral damage. The wreckage of the bank, together with the safe, begins to roll down the hill, and only Ballantine manages to jump on it. The ensuing pursuit ends at a high cliff on the coast: The team, together with Streiger, witness how the bank plunges together with Ballantine into the water. Ballantine, not wanting to be arrested again, begins to swim into the open sea. Streiger, being a non-swimmer, has to give up the hunt, and the rest of the team also stays behind.\nThe movie closes showing the majestic ocean, and a voice-over of Streiger as narrator, telling that some days later, the national bank of Samoa was robbed by a man. Nothing fancy about that, except that he was described as dripping wet, and Streiger vows to learn to swim and that he will catch Ballantine at last."

It was a charming idea [...] the idea of not simply robbing a bank but stealing the whole building. What happened is that Gower tried to turn it into a farce, and it didn't work. The people weren't equipped to play farce. Gower was a nice guy and a marvelous stage director; but the film simply wasn't deft, and it should have been. He held pretty much to the script but ruined what I thought was a good piece. He was the only bad experience I've ever had in my career with a director. I was bitterly disappointed.\""

She adopts a brisk, cheerful approach: socialising with guests at the wake, giving her husband's belongings to various charitable causes, and deciding she must devise an efficient plan to deal with her grief. Muriel's husband left her a considerable sum of money, and, despite having been advised not to make any \"big decisions\", she soon agrees to hand over control of the money to their son Giles (who received nothing from the will). Although it is clear to the audience that Giles is mismanaging the money, it comes as a surprise to Muriel when he loses her inheritance through poor investments. He reassures her there is nothing to worry about and the problem is simply \"liquidity\", but she is soon forced to sell her home and possessions and move to a small seaside town.\nMuriel ends the story poor and alone, losing contact with her children, Margaret having shown a great improvement and living an almost normal life after a spell of psychiatric treatment. It is implied Margaret's mental illness was the result of sexual molestation by her father. Muriel appears to be aware of this and also begins to wonder if she contributed to her husband's end with \"all those death-dealing breakfasts.\" She is now reduced to using the Meals on Wheels service she had once commanded, and her only entertainments are television and cassette tapes from the library.

Her younger sister, Lea (May) is hired on the recommendation of Christine. The two sisters become increasingly alienated from their employer, separated by barriers between the classes. The employer and her daughter look down on the sisters for the most trivial things, and it soon becomes the norm for the two pairs of women to not even speak directly to each other.\nWith only each other to turn to, the sisters' relationship becomes sexual, adding to the tension between the sisters and their employer. Both of them deal with trauma brought on by strained relationships with their mother and others of the church. Over time, there are continual rumors of the employer\u2019s daughter getting married and moving out. Christine becomes paranoid and jealous that Lea will go with her when that day comes, and she\u2019ll be left with nothing and no one, but Lea assures her this isn\u2019t the case. Christine fears she is a monster like her mother.\nOne day, the iron blows a fuse and burns the daughter\u2019s blouse Lea was preparing. Short on money and time, the sisters resign themselves to their fate; when their employer and her daughter return from a shopping trip, Christine tries to explain what happened. The widow claims she knows about the incestuous relationship between the sisters and they\u2019ll never work again once word gets out.  The sisters fly into a rage and brutally murder the widow and her daughter. The movie ends on a crime report detailing the state of the corpses as someone knocks on the mansion door.

When he learns from a co-worker that it is not a replica, but a functioning antique gun, the two form a friendship based around recreational target shooting and studying firearms history. Other disaffected teens join them, and they begin to call themselves \"the Dandies\". Dick becomes more and more attached to his gun, naming it \"Wendy\" and writing it love letters. The Dandies adopt an affected, anachronistic style of dressing and speaking, for example replacing the word \"killing\" with \"loving\". They treat their antique firearms as elaborate props, giving them names and backstories, playing games with them, and target shooting in an abandoned mining shaft that they decorate and call the Temple. They carry their guns at all times, but make a point of never showing off their guns in public.\nDick's childhood nanny Clarabelle introduces him to her troubled grandson Sebastian, an African-American youth from out of town who is on probation for a weapons-related crime. The town's sheriff, Sheriff Krugby, appoints Dick as an informal probation officer for Sebastian, believing that Dick is a good role model. Dick allows Sebastian to break probation and asks him to join the Dandies, but only if he follows their idiosyncratic rules. One day, Sebastian gives the group a suspicious box full of guns, and soon breaks a club rule by firing another member's gun. The group's sole female member, Susan, becomes interested in Sebastian. Dick becomes upset by the changes Sebastian's presence has triggered.\nSebastian tells Dick that his grandmother is too scared of \"gang violence\" to walk down the street to her cousin's home, and Dick proposes that the Dandies escort her there. Clarabelle panics when they encounter a deputy sheriff and ends up shooting him after a scuffle. The sheriff asks the Dandies to hand over Clarabelle, telling them they can keep their guns if they do so. The Dandies believe that they are being set up, and flee to the Temple with Clarabelle just as several other police officers arrive. Despite the fact that they are now wanted by police, the Dandies decide to finish taking Clarabelle to her cousin's, treating it as a suicide mission. Sebastian discovers Dick's final letter to Wendy, which ends with the coded threat: \"And now, it's the time of the season for loving.\" Armed, they head outside to face the team of shotgun-toting police officers.\nA gunfight ensues, during which most of the Dandies are killed or wounded, and Clarabelle is hit in the leg by a ricocheting bullet. Although he is also wounded, Dick manages to get Clarabelle to her cousin's house, but loses his gun Wendy in the confusion. Police officers surround the home. Sebastian, unhurt, remains hidden outside. Noticing Wendy on the street, he picks it up and runs into Clarabelle's cousin's home, where he shoots Dick with Wendy. The police on the roof across the street open fire on the building."

He will be presenting his invention, the Deathclock, which displays the date of a person's death after that person's finger is stuck into the machine.  At the symposium, the crew encounter one of Farnsworth's bitter former students, Professor Ogden Wernstrom. Wernstrom presents his invention, a reverse SCUBA suit that allows fish to breathe water while walking about on land, then taunts Farnsworth over his invention from the previous year\u2014the Deathclock.\nMortified that he had previously presented the device and forgotten about it, Farnsworth hastily begins drawing on a napkin. He presents the drawing, which depicts a Smelloscope, a device that allows people to smell distant cosmic objects, but is humiliated when he smears the drawing. Back at Planet Express, Farnsworth invites everybody to see the Smelloscope that he had constructed last year and also forgotten about. Fry begins smelling objects around the Solar System and quickly discovers a foul-smelling meteor. After calculating its trajectory, Farnsworth announces that the object will collide with New New York City in 72 hours, reducing it to a \"stinky crater\".\nAfter some research, they find a video that reveals the object to be a giant ball of garbage from Old New York, launched into space in 2052. After warning Mayor Poopenmayer, a plan is hatched to destroy the garbage ball. The Planet Express crew is sent on a mission to plant a bomb on the ball. Then, once activated, the bomb will be set to allow the crew twenty-five minutes to escape. Farnsworth also reminds them that if it blew up any time later, the explosion would cause garbage to rain across the entire Earth, killing millions.\nUnfortunately, after starting the bomb, they find out the Professor put the bomb's countdown display in upside down, and it actually only allows 52 seconds. The crew panics, and Bender throws the bomb into space to save them, where it explodes harmlessly. Wernstrom makes several demands before quickly leaving. In a last-ditch effort to redeem himself, Farnsworth comes up with a second plan to save the city: launching a second ball of garbage to bounce against the first one and sending it flying into the sun.\nFry leads the city to quickly generate a second ball of garbage, which is fired at the first garbage ball. The rocket flies into the air and hits the other garbage ball, which slingshots around planets into the sun, while the new ball flies out of the solar system. For saving the city from the garbage ball, Professor Farnsworth is given the inventor's award, which was confiscated from Wernstrom as punishment abandoning everyone. Leela's concerns that the new garbage ball will return and destroy a future generation are quickly dismissed, as the new ball should not return for hundreds of years."

Asked by Mrs. Ward to come inside and warm up, Hannah sees that they are struggling financially and are in need of some domestic help. She offers her services and becomes their cook and housekeeper for room and board.\nMr. Ward, a science teacher by day, is an inventor by night attempting to create something that will provide sufficient money for Marcia, their teenaged daughter Sally (Granville) and their new baby, to have some luxuries in life. Hannah, who is extremely wise and helpful, comes up with some good ideas. She persuades Ward to sell old and useless furniture to raise money and make a place for his work in the basement.\nTheir teenaged neighbor, Peter Trimble (Cooper), is one of Ward's students and the son of the richest man in town, Sam Trimble (O'Neill). Hannah is very pleased to know Peter and to be a part of his life. In her devotion to him, however, she is never able to indulge the motherly instinct she feels, except in an indirect way. He is very good at science and, after Hannah suggests that he set a good example for the boy, Ward asks young Trimble to become his assistant. Sally develops a crush on Peter.\nWard's invention, an \"iceless icebox,\" is unintentionally revealed by Peter to local mechanics Joe Ellis (William Pawley) and his brother Bill (Edward Pawley). When the Ellis brothers steal it and have it patented, Peter feels so bad about what he did that he lies when Ward asks him about it. In the meantime, Sally becomes ill with pneumonia.\nHannah persuades Ward that it is best to \"turn the other cheek\" and to give young Peter another chance. Ward then develops a new and better feature for his invention, which is on its way to becoming an electric home refrigerator. Sally recovers and she and her mother, Marcia, leave on a trip with the baby.\nAnother crisis arises, however, when wealthy Chicago businessman Thomas Bradford (James Stephenson) arrives to discuss financing of Ward's invention. Hannah reveals to Ward that Peter Trimble is her son who she was forced to give up all those years ago because he was born out of wedlock. Sam Trimble adopted him after his own baby died, but Bradford is the boy's biological father. When Bradford finds out that Peter is his son, he wants to claim him. Hannah, however, persuades him not to reveal the truth to Peter.\nSatisfied with the kind of young man her son has become, and that he is on the right path in life, Hannah, leaves without Peter, who believes that his adoptive parents are his biological parents. She walks off into the wintry landscape."

        "content": "The film uses a nonlinear narrative, alternating between J. Edgar Hoover's role in establishing the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and his later years trying to safeguard it against perceived threats. As a frame story, the aging Hoover narrates the events of the Bureau's early years to a series of agents he has assigned to ghostwrite a book about it.\nIn 1919, Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer survives an assassination attempt by anarchists and assigns Hoover, a Justice Department employee,  to head a division dedicated to purging radicals. Realizing that the police handling of the crime scene was primitive, and recognizing the importance of criminal science, he informs his mother and moral guide Annie of recent events. Hoover then meets newly-hired secretary Helen Gandy and takes her to the Library of Congress, where he demonstrates the card catalog system he created, claiming that solving crimes would be easier if every citizen were easily identifiable. Despite rejecting Hoover's awkward advances, Gandy becomes his personal secretary and confidant. \nDespite his close monitoring of suspected foreign radicals, Hoover finds that the Department of Labor is unable to deport anyone without clear evidence of a crime; however, Anthony Caminetti, commissioner general of immigration, dislikes prominent anarchist Emma Goldman. By arranging to make her eligible for deportation by discredting her marriage, Hoover creates legal precedent to deport numerous other radicals. Following the Palmer Raids, Palmer loses his job due to being labelled as a scapegoat for the harsh methods adopted, and his successor, Harlan F. Stone, appoints Hoover as director of the department's Bureau of Investigation. Hoover has Gandy create a confidential file for collecting incriminating information on people in power.\nWith the First Red Scare over, Hoover focuses the Bureau on fighting gangsters, and it successfully pursues a string of gangster and bank robbery crimes across the Midwest, including the high profile case of John Dillinger. When the Lindbergh kidnapping captures national attention in 1932, he urges passage of the Federal Kidnapping Act, increasing the Bureau's power. He establishes the FBI Laboratory, applying forensic science techniques to the investigation, and has the registration numbers on the ransom bills monitored. Though Charles Lindbergh Jr. is found dead, these techniques lead to Bruno Richard Hauptmann being arrested, convicted, and sentenced to death for the crime; the case elevates the FBI to prominence.\nHoover hires recently-graduated attorney Clyde Tolson to the Bureau in 1930; the two develop a close personal relationship, and Hoover promotes Tolson to Associate Director. When Hoover confesses to Annie his discomfiture about being in romantic situations with women, she says she would rather he be dead than gay. When Tolson tells Hoover that he loves him, Hoover panickedly claims that he wants to marry actress Dorothy Lamour. Tolson becomes infuriated and the two fight, culminating in Tolson kissing Hoover and threatening to end their association if Hoover ever talks about another woman again. Hoover then admits his feelings for Tolson after Tolson departs, and Annie's eventual death leaves him grief-stricken.\nFollowing an embarrassing line of questioning by Senate Appropriations Committee chair Kenneth McKellar in 1933, Hoover becomes increasingly vengeful against those who challenge his reputation and the Bureau's. He uses covert listening devices to collect compromising information which he uses to blackmail key political figures over the years, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, protecting his position and increasing the Bureau's power. He starts an illegal counterintelligence program to counter what he perceives as a new wave of radicals, culminating in his unsuccessful attempt to blackmail Martin Luther King Jr. into declining the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 via the FBI\u2013King suicide letter.\nTolson suffers a stroke that severely weakens him, and Hoover's strength declines with age. Fearing that President Richard Nixon will acquire his confidential files and use them to ruin the FBI's reputation, he asks Gandy to destroy them after he dies keep them out of Nixon's hands. Tolson urges Hoover to retire and accuses him of exaggerating his involvement in major events in the Bureau's history, claiming that Hoover kept the glory for the actions of his other agents, including Hauptmann's arrest. Upon Hoover's death, Gandy destroys Hoover's files as Nixon eulogizes Hoover on television."

Black began working on it in 2008, producing several drafts over a two year period. Warner Bros. Pictures wanted to keep the budget down, so producers Grazer and Robert Lorenz brought in Clint Eastwood, known for his efficient filmmaking, to direct and co-produce. Eastwood was able to shoot the film in 39 days and complete it under budget, for a total of $35 million.Unnamed sources cited by The Hollywood Reporter claimed that Leonardo DiCaprio dropped his usual fee from $20 million to $2 million to star in the film. For scenes in which he played the aged Hoover, DiCaprio had to spend up to six hours having makeup applied. Charlize Theron was originally slated to play Helen Gandy, but dropped out of the project to do Snow White and the Huntsman. Eastwood considered Amy Adams before finally selecting Naomi Watts for the role.Though much of the film is set in Washington, D.C., only a few scenes were shot there, including the interior of the Library of Congress and the view from the balcony of Hoover's former office. The exterior of the courthouse in Warrenton, Virginia was used to represent the Hunterdon County Courthouse in Flemington, New Jersey, where Richard Hauptmann's trial took place. Scenes set inside the courthouse were filmed at the Old Orange County Courthouse in Santa Ana, California. Scenes of the Lindbergh estate were shot in The Plains, Virginia, while Arlington County, Virginia was filmed for some historic neighborhoods.Most of the film was shot in and around Los Angeles. Sets representing the hallways of the United States Department of Justice and several offices were built on Stage 16 at the Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank. The Cicada Restaurant, near Pershing Square, stood in for New York's Stork Club, while the Park Plaza Hotel served as both the men's department of Garfinckel's department store and the United States Senate chamber. The Pico House represented a train station for a scene depicting the Kansas City massacre.

She praises DiCaprio for conveying the tempo of Hoover's speech. However, she notes that the film's central narrative device in which Hoover dictates his memoirs to FBI agents chosen as writers, is fictitious: \"He didn't ever have the sort of formal situation that you see in the movie where he was dictating a memoir to a series of young agents, and that that is the official record of the FBI.\"Historian Aaron J. Stockham of the Waterford School, whose dissertation was on the relationship of the FBI and the US Congress during the Hoover years, wrote on the History News Network of George Mason University, \"J.

It is the sequel to the 2008 film Mamma Mia!, which in turn is based on the 1999 musical of the same name using the music of ABBA. The film features an ensemble cast, including Christine Baranski, Pierce Brosnan, Dominic Cooper, Colin Firth, Andy Garc\u00eda, Lily James, Amanda Seyfried, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Julie Walters, Cher, Meryl Streep, Alexa Davies, Jessica Keenan Wynn, Josh Dylan, Jeremy Irvine, and Hugh Skinner. Both a prequel and a sequel, the plot is set after the events of the previous film, and is intersected with flashbacks to Donna's youth in 1979, with some scenes from the two time periods mirroring each other.\nDue to the financial success of the first film, Universal Pictures had long been interested in a sequel. The film was officially announced in May 2017, with Parker hired to write and direct. In June 2017, many of the original cast confirmed their involvement, with James being cast in the role of Young Donna that July. Filming took place from August to December 2017 in Croatia (most prominently Vis), Bordeaux, Stockholm, Oxford, Hampton and at Shepperton Studios. A British and American joint venture, the film was co-produced by Playtone, Littlestar Productions, Perfect World Pictures, and Legendary Entertainment.\nMamma Mia! Here We Go Again was premiered at the Hammersmith Apollo in London on July 16, 2018, and was released in the United Kingdom and the United States on July 20, 2018, ten years to the week after its predecessor's release, in both standard and IMAX formats. The film was a box office success, grossing $402 million worldwide and received generally positive reviews, as an improvement over its predecessor with critics praising the performances and musical numbers. The film is dedicated to the memory of production designer Alan MacDonald."

        "content": "In a 1979 flashback, young Donna Sheridan graduates from Oxford's New College with Rosie and Tanya (\"When I Kissed the Teacher\"), and dreams of the Greek island Kalokairi. Her mother Ruby is a famous singer, but they have a strained relationship, she is always away on tour so does not attend the graduation. Fed up with her mother's constant absence and determined to spend her life making memories, Donna travels to Kalokairi to find her destiny.\nIn the present, Sophie is in Kalokairi preparing the grand reopening of the Hotel Bella Donna in honour of her recently deceased mother. Harry and Bill can't attend due to overseas obligations and Sophie also feels estranged from Sky, who has been offered a job in NYC (\"One of Us\").\nIn Paris, Donna meets the sweet, awkward Harry Bright, who instantly falls in love with her (\"Waterloo\"). They spend the night together, but Donna leaves early for Greece. Missing her boat to Kalokairi, Bill Anderson gives her a lift in his sailboat, where they dance and flirt (\"Why Did It Have to Be Me?\"). On the way, they help stranded fisherman Alexio back to shore in time to save the love of his life from marrying another. Unbeknownst to Donna, Harry has followed her to Greece, however he arrives too late and she sails off with Bill.\nIn the present, Rosie and Tanya arrive and Sophie shows them the renovated hotel (\"I Have a Dream\"). This mirrors the past, when Donna explores the abandoned farmhouse that would eventually become the hotel. A heavy storm then breaks out and Donna discovers a trapped horse and soothes it with the assistance of Sam Carmichael. In the present, a heavy storm both destroys the decorations and cuts off ferries to Kalokairi, to Sophie's dismay.\nSam, who lives in a cabin on the island, reassures Sophie that she can never disappoint her mother, unlike him. Before Sophie was born, Donna and Sam were enjoying a whirlwind romance (\"The Name of the Game\") which ended badly when she discovered he was engaged to another. Heartbroken, Donna breaks it off and tearfully watches him leave the island (\"Knowing Me, Knowing You\"), while the present Sam reassures Sophie how important she was to her.\nFollowing Sam's departure, Donna is visited by Tanya and Rosie, who cheer her up by performing as Donna and the Dynamos (\"Mamma Mia\"). Bill returns to the island, and she joins him on his boat, much to the chagrin of Rosie who fell for Bill. While they are gone, Sam returns, having ended his engagement for Donna, but is saddened to hear she is with another. \nDonna discovers she is pregnant but has no idea which one of her three recent lovers is the father. Bill's great-aunt Sofia overhears Donna's wish to stay on the island and reveals she owns the abandoned farmhouse where she has been staying. Donna happily accepts her offer to stay there, where she later gives birth to Sophie.\nIn the present, Sophie tells Rosie and Tanya about her problems with Sky, and Rosie explains how she and Bill broke up (\"Angel Eyes\"). Meanwhile, Bill, Harry, and Sky leave their ventures abroad to support Sophie but are told there are no boats to Kalokairi. \nHowever, Alexio recognises Bill so offers the trio safe boat passage to the island as gratitude for saving his relationship. Bill convinces everyone to join them for the Kalokairi party. When the guests arrive (\"Dancing Queen\"), Bill and Rosie soon reunite over their mutual grief over Donna's death, and Sophie tells Sky she is pregnant and never feeling closer to her mother.\nThe celebration is suddenly disrupted when Ruby arrives, despite not being invited by Sophie. Ruby explains that Sky tracked her down, and she wants to build a relationship with her granddaughter. Sophie then performs with the Dynamos in honour of Donna (\"I've Been Waiting for You\"). Ruby is proud, and expresses slight but sincere grief over her daughter's death. Then it is revealed that the hotel manager, Se\u00f1or Fernando Cienfuegos, is Ruby's long-lost lover from 1959, so they are joyously reunited (\"Fernando\").\nNine months later, Sophie gives birth to baby boy Donny. At the christening, Donna's ghost proudly watches, and they have a final moment before Donna fully passes on (\"My Love, My Life\"). The end credits show all the characters, including Donna and the younger cast, at a party at Hotel Bella Donna (\"Super Trouper\")."

Homer is stuck hanging upside down from a narrow hole, and while Marge and Bart try to find a way out, Lisa tells him a story to pass the time.\nIn Lisa's story, a bighorn sheep begins to attack her. She runs to the nearest shelter, Mr. Burns' house, and they hide in the attic. There, Lisa finds a photo of Burns as an employee at Moe's Tavern, and he tells her the origins of it. Burns explains that he and Rich Texan were once involved in a scavenger hunt, with the winner getting all the possessions of the loser. Burns was able to get every item besides one: a picture of himself with a smiling child. The Texan won, and Burns had to get a job at Moe's to regain his fortune. While working, he finds a letter by Moe about his secret treasure.\nThe summer before Edna Krabappel was to begin teaching, she and Moe met and fell in love. Moe wanted to leave Springfield with her but had no money, only for Snake, a polite idealistic archaeologist, to bring a large amount of gold coins he intended to donate to a museum. Moe stole them from Snake, leading him to begin a life of crime. Before Moe and Edna are about to leave, Edna stops by Springfield Elementary School and finds Bart with detention over the summer, claiming he does bad in school because nobody believes in him. Edna tells Moe that she will stay in Springfield to help Bart succeed. Back in the cave, Bart explains that he was lying to distract Edna and help Nelson steal classroom equipment.\nMoe became depressed and used his coins to play music he and Edna liked on the tavern's jukebox repeatedly. After reading the letter, Burns took the coins from the jukebox and bought his possessions back from the Texan; he complies, but refuses to give the nuclear power plant back until Burns completes the scavenger hunt. The sheep bursts into the attic, and Burns gets hurt defending Lisa. The sheep shows that it found Lisa's pearl necklace and was merely trying to return it. Lisa, in gratitude, takes a photo of her and Burns together, allowing him to get the plant back from the Texan.\nAfter Lisa's story, Homer breaks free from the hole. He reveals that he saw the Texan hide the gold coins in the cave, and brought the family there to steal them. Just then, the Texan shows up, and the gold is found. Moe, Burns, and Snake appear, and enter a Mexican standoff. When Marge grabs the bag of coins and drops it into a chasm, everyone realizes how greedy they had been and thank her for getting rid of the gold, except for Burns, who attempts to climb down the chasm to retrieve the gold.\nThe episode is revealed to have been a story by Bart, talking to Principal Skinner as to why he was unable to study for a test. Skinner is unconvinced until he sees Edna making out with Moe outside the school. When Moe asks Edna why she forgives him, she says that she \"just wants a man with a healthy libido.\" Moe is unable to fulfill this request, and the Texan cheers, \"Moe can't catch a break!\""

Bitel feels that \"American Yakuza is in effect 'The Godfather: the next Generation' \u2013 an immigrant saga of family, blood and assimilation that just happens to be set in the world of organized crime.\"  He found flaws in that parts of the film \"have the look of a rock video\" and overall suffers from needing a larger budget.

At the site of an illegally slain bear they interview local hunters, who comment that the bear tracks look odd, as well as Finn Haugen (Hans Morten Hansen), head of the Norwegian Wildlife Board. Finn dismisses the idea that the bear tracks could have been faked. The students follow Hans in an attempt to secure an interview but he continually rebuffs them. After following him into a forest at night time, they see mysterious flashing lights and hear roars. Hans comes running back, screaming \"Troll!\" Thomas is attacked and reveals that he was bitten by something. They escape in Hans's Land Rover and discover their own vehicle turned over with the tyres ripped off. Hans admits that it is not bears he is hunting, but trolls. Though sceptical, the students ask if they can join Hans and film his hunt, to which he consents on the condition that they do exactly as he instructs.\nThe next day Hans makes them disguise themselves with \"troll stench\" (a slimy concentrate made from \"everything you can squeeze out of a troll\") and asks if any of them believe in God or Jesus, because a troll can smell a Christian man's blood. Hans wields a \"flash gun\", a weapon that emits powerful UV-rays to simulate sunlight and turn trolls to stone, though he comments that sometimes the trolls \"just explode\" depending on how old they are. The students are stunned when Hans flushes out a giant three-headed troll (called a Tusseladd). Hans manages to turn the troll to stone and explains to the students that he only allowed them to come along because he's tired of working for little compensation and wants them to divulge the truth. Finn, who actually works for the Troll Security Service (TSS), arrives with a team to deposit a bear carcass and plant fake tracks, and tells the students that they will not be allowed to keep their tapes. In a series of interviews, Hans reveals that Finn's work is to keep trolls a secret, while his is to kill any that come near populated areas. He also explains that the trolls have been acting aggressively lately and have begun to leave their territories more often than usual, and that he must get a troll blood sample to determine why.\nThe students accompany Hans on another hunt using live goats on a bridge as bait. Hans successfully obtains a blood sample from a bridge troll (Raglefant) and takes it to a veterinarian who works for the TSS, but finds that it will take several days before any results can be found. Investigating a farm where a number of trees have been uprooted, Hans and the film crew find troll tracks leading into an abandoned mine, the lair of a pack of cave trolls (Dovregubbens). The trolls return unexpectedly and the group is trapped inside. The situation becomes more tense when Kalle confesses that he is, in fact, a Christian. The trolls pick up Kalle's scent and discover the group. In a panic, the group runs for the safety of daylight at the cave entrance, but Kalle is caught and killed before he can escape.\nThe replacement camerawoman is Malica, a Muslim; Hans is uncertain about how trolls will react to that. Finn demands that Hans head north to troll territory to get the problem under control. The group finds signs of a Jotnar, a giant mountain troll 61 metres tall. Thomas falls ill, and they learn that the troll blood sample came back positive for rabies, meaning Thomas has been infected by the bite he received several days earlier.\nAfter several attempts, Hans manages to kill the Jotnar by launching a rocket-like projectile that transforms the troll into stone. Before doing so, he directs the others to find the highway. Finn and his TSS agents arrive to confiscate the students' tapes. Thomas flees with the camera and collapses at the side of a road when the tape cuts out. Just before the cut to black, a truck is seen coming down the road towards the camera. An epilogue tells the audience that none of the students were heard from again. The film ends with a news clip of the Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg appearing to admit to the existence of trolls, though the press fails to take notice."

        "content": "Trollhunter contains many references to Norwegian culture and Norwegian folktales in particular. Among those are the belief that there are different species of trolls, such as the woodland and mountain trolls, which can be further categorised into subspecies as in the film. The most well-known is probably the Mountain King, which is mentioned in the play Peer Gynt and its music by Edvard Grieg. The Norwegian name for Mountain King, Dovregubbe, is a compound word whose first part is used in the name for the mountain range Dovrefjell where the characters meet the final troll.Other common troll descriptions from Norwegian folklore which are used in the film include trolls having a tail, multiple heads, the ability to smell a Christian's blood, eating rocks, but loving meat and sometimes being man-eaters. The trolls are also described as big, old, strong, but slow and dim-witted, turning to stone when exposed to sunlight. The latter is a point emphasised in the film, as Hans uses UV light to kill the trolls. However, he also states that not everything from the tales is true.The film also has several specific references to fairy tales. For example The Boy Who Had an Eating Match with a Troll when the camera man asks about an eating contest, and the Three Billy Goats Gruff when Hans attempts to lure a troll from under a bridge using three goats. The fairy tale Soria Moria Castle is one of the tales that tells about trolls being able to smell a Christian man's blood. A painting by Theodor Kittelsen based on the same fairy tale is also used as a backdrop on one of the trips they do in the film (Thomas stands in the same pose and asks his friends \"Do I look like that famous painting?\"). The look of the trolls in the film is also influenced by painters like Theodor Kittelsen and John Bauer.As reflected by how the students answer Hans, only a fraction of Norwegians consider themselves religious or visit the church regularly, even though the majority of Norwegians are members of the state church.The film also makes references to the often heated conflict between farmers and predators eating their livestock and the farmers' limited ability to react without breaking Norwegian wild life regulations. Similarly, there are conflicts that arise when new power lines need to be passed through the landscape.With several of the cast being comedians that are fairly well-known to the Norwegian audience, including Otto Jespersen playing Hans, it also sets the tone of the film for many. Robert Stoltenberg playing the Polish bear hunter makes that scene less serious, and plays on xenophobic stereotypes that most Norwegian immigrants are from Poland, often speak mediocre Norwegian or English, do what they are told without asking questions and often do the work Norwegians won't do themselves."

The film is about an Eastern European man who is stuck in New York's John F. Kennedy Airport terminal when he is denied entry to the United States and at the same time is unable to return to his native country because of a military coup.\nThe film is partially inspired by the true story of the 18-year stay of Mehran Karimi Nasseri in Terminal 1 of Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, France, from 1988 to 2006. In 1988, Nasseri flew from Brussels to London via Paris; however, he was sent back to Paris because he lost his refugee passport. Nasseri lived in the transit area of Terminal 1 at Charles de Gaulle Airport until 2006, after France denied him entry. After finishing his previous film, Catch Me If You Can, Spielberg decided to direct The Terminal because he wanted to next make a film \"that could make us laugh and cry and feel good about the world\". Due to a lack of suitable airports willing to provide their facilities for the production, an entire working set was built inside a large hangar at the LA/Palmdale Regional Airport, with most of the film's exterior shots taken from the Montreal\u2013Mirabel International Airport.The film was released in North America on June 18, 2004, to generally positive reviews and was a commercial success, earning $219 million worldwide."

        "content": "Viktor Navorski, a traveler from the country of Krakozhia, arrives at New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport and learns that a coup d'\u00e9tat has occurred back home. The United States does not recognize Krakozhia's new government, and Viktor is not permitted to enter the United States or return home as his passport is no longer considered valid. Because of this, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seize his passport and return ticket pending resolution of the issue. He becomes a refugee and is forced to live at the airport.\nFrank Dixon, the Acting Field Commissioner of the airport, instructs Viktor to stay in the transit lounge until the issue is resolved. Viktor settles in at the terminal with only his luggage and a Planters peanut can. Viktor finds a gate currently under renovation and makes it his home. Dixon becomes determined to get Viktor out of the airport and make him someone else's problem. He tries to get Viktor to leave by luring him out of the airport by ordering guards away from the exit for five minutes, but it fails. Dixon then tries to get Viktor to claim asylum if he is fearful of returning home, so he can leave the airport, but it also fails due to Viktor claiming that he is not scared of his own country. Viktor befriends and assists several airport employees and travelers: Gupta Rajan, a janitor who delights in watching people slip on his freshly cleaned floors; Joe Mulroy, a baggage handler who plays poker, betting lost luggage items; Dolores Torres, an immigration officer; and Enrique Cruz, a food service truck driver who has a crush on Dolores. Also among them is United Airlines flight attendant Amelia Warren, whom he sees periodically and tries to woo after she mistakes him for a building contractor who is frequently traveling. Dixon, who is being considered for a promotion, becomes more and more obsessed with getting rid of Viktor. In the meantime, Viktor begins reading books and magazines to learn English. After he impulsively remodels a wall in the renovation zone, he is hired by an airport contractor and paid under the table.\nOne day, Dixon detains Amelia and interrogates her about Viktor and his mysterious peanut can. Amelia, who realizes Viktor has not been entirely truthful, confronts him at his makeshift home, where he shows her that the Planters peanut can contains a copy of the \"A Great Day in Harlem\" photograph. His late father was a jazz enthusiast who had discovered the famous portrait in a Hungarian newspaper in 1958 and vowed to collect the autographs of all 57 of the musicians featured on it. He died before he could get the last one, from tenor saxophonist Benny Golson. Viktor has come to New York to do so. After hearing the story, Amelia kisses Viktor.\nAfter nine months, Viktor's friends awaken Viktor with the news that the war in Krakozhia has ended, and he can get a green stamp, allowing him to leave the airport. Meanwhile, Amelia had asked her \"friend\" Max, actually a married government official with whom she had been having an affair, to get Viktor a one-day emergency visa to fulfill his dream, but Viktor is disappointed to learn that she has rekindled her relationship with the man during this process. When he presents the emergency visa at customs, Viktor is told that Dixon must sign the visa, but with Viktor's passport now valid again, Dixon is determined to immediately send him back to Krakozhia. He threatens Viktor that if he does not go home at once, he will prosecute his friends at the airport for their illegal activities, most seriously by deporting janitor Gupta Rajan back to India to face a charge of assaulting a police officer. Unwilling to let this happen, Viktor finally agrees to return home. When Gupta learns of this, however, he runs in front of the plane which would take Viktor back home, ensuring his deportation and taking the burden off Viktor.\nThe delay gives Viktor enough time to get into the city. Dixon orders his officers to arrest Viktor, but disillusioned with Dixon, they let him leave the airport. As Viktor is getting in a taxi, Amelia arrives in another taxi, and they briefly smile and make eye contact. Dixon himself arrives at the taxi stand only moments after Viktor's taxi has left. When his officers arrive and one suggests immediately cordoning off the area and searching all vehicles to find him, Dixon, having had a change of heart, tells them that they have incoming travelers to handle. Viktor arrives in New York at the hotel where Benny Golson is performing and finally collects the last autograph. He gets in a taxi, telling the driver, \"I am going home\". The taxi takes off and heads back to the airport."

        "content": "Some have noted that the film appears to be inspired by the story of Mehran Karimi Nasseri, also known as Sir Alfred, an Iranian refugee who lived in Terminal One of the Charles de Gaulle airport, Paris from 1988 when his refugee papers were stolen until 2006 when he was hospitalized for unspecified ailments. In September 2003, The New York Times noted that Spielberg bought the rights to Nasseri's life story as the basis for the film; and in September 2004 The Guardian noted Nasseri received thousands of dollars from the filmmakers. However, none of the studio's publicity materials mention Nasseri's story as an inspiration for the film. The 1993 French film Lost in Transit was already based on the same story. In deciding to make the film, Steven Spielberg stated that after directing Catch Me If You Can, \"I wanted to do another movie that could make us laugh and cry and feel good about the world.... This is a time when we need to smile more and Hollywood movies are supposed to do that for people in difficult times.\"Spielberg traveled around the world to find an actual airport that would let him film for the length of the production, but could not find one. The Terminal set was built in a massive hangar at the LA/Palmdale Regional Airport. The hangar, part of the U.S. Air Force Plant 42 complex was used to build the Rockwell International B-1B bomber. The set was built to full earthquake construction codes and was based on D\u00fcsseldorf Airport. The shape of both the actual terminal and the set viewed sideways is a cross-section of an aircraft wing. Because of this design, the film was one of the first to use the Spidercam for film production. The camera, most often used for televised sports, allowed Spielberg the ability to create sweeping shots across the set. The design of the set for The Terminal, as noted by Roger Ebert in his reviews and attested by Spielberg himself in a feature by Empire magazine, was greatly inspired by Jacques Tati's classic film PlayTime.Tom Hanks based his characterization of Viktor Navorski on his father-in-law Allan Wilson, a Bulgarian immigrant, who according to Hanks can speak \"Russian, Turkish, Polish, Greek, little bit of Italian, little bit of French\", in addition to his native Bulgarian. Hanks also had some help from a Bulgarian translator."

It was released on 9 September 1977. The film shocked audiences who were used to seeing Rajinikanth and Sivakumar in their usual roles; nevertheless, it was a commercial success, and won two Filmfare Awards: Best Tamil Film and Best Tamil Director for Muthuraman.

A depressed Sampath attempts suicide, but Nagaraj stops him, and Sampath decides to stop selling garments, instead confining himself to remaining Nagaraj's assistant.\nAboard a train bound for Madras, Nagaraj and Sampath encounter Muthu, a temple trust clerk who has a suitcase full of cash. But Muthu dies en route of a heart attack and Nagaraj steals his suitcase, over Sampath's objections.

But after meeting him, the duo found him to have \"brightness\" and decided to cast him in \"something bigger, better\". The film was Bhuvana Oru Kelvi Kuri, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Maharishi. Produced by N. S. Mani under the banner M. A. M. Films who earlier worked as production controller for AVM Productions, its screenplay was written by Arunachalam. The film was the first collaboration of Rajinikanth and Muthuraman, and was conceived during the Emergency.The film had a role swap as Sivakumar, then known for playing clean and positive characters, played an antihero while Rajinikanth, then an established villain, played a positive character Sampath. Muthuraman said he deliberately cast Rajinikanth against type since he wanted to \"experiment with his acting skills\". He also explained that his decision to shoot the film in black-and-white, rather than colour, was to save costs. Since Rajinikanth was not fluent in Tamil at that time, he was trained by S. L. Narayanan, who was popularly known by the prefix \"Vaadhyar\".Cinematography was handled by Babu. Some scenes were filmed in Panagudi, Tirunelveli. A group song was shot in Tada area and it was decided that the song sequence could be shot in one day but due to a technical fault in the playback equipment which occurred when the half of the song scene was over, it was not possible to continue the shooting, the crew had no other option but to stay there for the night and finish the shoot next day. The film was initially shot with the ending of Sampath and Bhuvana (Sumithra) marrying; however after watching the preview, Muthuraman felt Bhuvana's purity seemed to have been spoiled when she was allowed to live together so the team discussed together various endings and half-heartedly agreed to the conclusion of Bhuvana living a widow's life after Sampath's death which was well received by audience. The film was edited by R. Vittal, and its final length measured 3,976.12 metres (13,045.0 ft)."

But I don't fly.\" When not broadly riffing about love, commitment, and Jay-Z and Kim Kardashian, Rafael heals everyone around him (all of them dull types, including the angry goth teen and misbehaving young son) with advice like \"When you learn to love someone without condition, you will be loved in return\"\u2014nauseating platitudes that turn the film into a comedy of corny homilies.\""

He also dreams of poisoning as many people as he can. In his teen years, he poisons a schoolmate\u2014making him ill rather than killing him\u2014in order to date a girl his schoolmate was seeing. His conversation with his date involves vivid, graphic descriptions of deadly car accidents. He also reads a comic book account of an event in which the Dutch Resistance killed a whole German army camp in the occupied Netherlands during the Second World War by poisoning their water supply with thallium.\nGraham is arrested at the age of 14 outside his home in Neasden after poisoning his father and stepmother with thallium, killing his stepmother and leaving his father seriously ill. During the struggle with police, he drops his \"Exit Dose\" of thallium, which he intended to use to commit suicide should he be caught. He is hospitalised for nine years in an institution for the criminally insane, during which time a psychiatrist works with him in the hopes of rehabilitating him.\nGraham's dishonesty becomes evident to the doctor, who can see that Graham is trying to deceive him. Graham apparently has no dreams to share with the psychiatrist so he \"borrows\" a fellow prisoner's dreams. This source is shut off to him, however, once the fellow prisoner commits suicide. Despite the initial evidence of Graham's deceitfulness, the doctor eventually gets him released.\nGraham then goes to work in a camera factory and is shown the secret ingredient used in the company's shutter system\u2014thallium. It is not long before Graham starts poisoning people again. He kills two of his workmates by poisoning their tea with thallium stolen from the laboratory, and makes many others ill. For months, the source of the \"bug\" afflicting the workers at the factory remains a mystery until one unforeseen event leads to Graham's being found out. As a hygiene measure, all the personalised teacups are replaced with uniform ones, leaving Graham unable to poison people selectively. His efforts to memorise which cup is going to which person give him away and his workmates finally realise what is going on.\nGraham is arrested soon afterwards and he is later sentenced to a lengthy custodial term, this time in an ordinary prison. He commits suicide by poisoning himself with the \"Newton's Diamond\" he made in the psychiatric hospital."

Chance has a reputation for reckless, impulsive behavior and, unbeknownst to his superiors in the Service, is also corrupt. Hart is three days away from retirement. Alone, Hart stakes out a warehouse in the desert thought to be a print house of counterfeiter and artist Eric \"Rick\" Masters, and is killed by Masters and his bodyguard, Jack. Chance proclaims to his new partner, John Vukovich, that he will take Masters down no matter what.\nThe two agents attempt to get information on Masters by putting one of his criminal associates, attorney Max Waxman, under surveillance. Vukovich falls asleep on watch, which allows Masters to murder Waxman, who had crossed him. While Vukovich wants to go by the book, Chance becomes increasingly reckless and unethical in pursuit of Masters. He relies on his sexual-extortion relationship with parolee/informant Ruth for information, while Vukovich meets privately with Masters' associates, including attorney Bob Grimes, whom he attempts to flip. Grimes, acknowledging a potential conflict of interest that could ruin his legal practice, agrees to set up a meeting between his client and the two agents, who pose as doctors from Palm Springs interested in Masters' counterfeiting services. Masters is reluctant to work with them, but ultimately agrees to print them $1 million worth of fake bills.\nIn turn, Masters demands $30,000 in front money, which is three times the authorized agency limit for buy money. To get the cash, Chance persuades Vukovich to aid him in robbing Thomas Ling, a man whom Ruth previously told Chance is bringing in $50,000 cash to purchase stolen diamonds. Chance and Vukovich intercept Ling at Union Station and seize the cash in an industrial area under the Sixth Street Viaduct. Ling's cover people follow them and, while observing the robbery, open fire and accidentally kill Ling. Chance and Vukovich try to evade them through the streets, freeways and even one of the flood control channels, before a final escape by going the wrong way on the freeway. \nThe next day, the end of their daily briefing includes a bulletin that Ling was an undercover FBI agent who was killed while engaging in a sting operation. Only a generic description of the assailants and their vehicle is given. While Chance and Vukovich did not kill Ling, Vukovich is nonetheless consumed by guilt, while Chance is apathetic and focused solely on getting Masters. Unable to persuade Chance to come clean about their role in Ling's death, Vukovich meets with Grimes, who advises him to turn himself in and testify against Chance in exchange for a lighter sentence. Vukovich refuses to implicate his partner. Chance sets up the buy with Masters, who seems to hint that he is aware of the heist.\nChance and Vukovich meet with Masters for the exchange. After inspecting the counterfeit million, the agents attempt to arrest Masters and Jack, but Jack pulls a shotgun. Jack and Chance fatally shoot each other, and Masters escapes. Vukovich gives chase, going to a warehouse a previous informant had told him about. By the time he arrives, Masters has set fire to everything inside, destroying all evidence. Vukovich confronts Masters and during a brief struggle, Masters asks Vukovich why he did not take Grimes' advice to turn his partner in, revealing that Grimes was working on Masters' behalf all along. While Vukovich is stunned at the revelation, Masters grabs a board and knocks him unconscious. Masters then covers Vukovich with shredded paper and is about to set him on fire when Vukovich comes round and shoots Masters. Masters drops his lighter and accidentally sets himself ablaze. Vukovich shoots the burning man, continuing to pull the trigger of his empty gun as Masters burns alive.\nDressed more casually, Vukovich visits Ruth as she packs up to leave Los Angeles. He mentions Chance's death, suggesting she had known all along that Ling was an FBI agent and she had played Chance. He knows Chance left her with the remaining cash, which the agency now wants back, but Ruth says she needed it to pay debts. Vukovich declares that Ruth is now working for him, turning into the same \"whatever it takes\" agent that Chance had been, and stopping her efforts to escape her shady life."

What they finally recorded has not only enhanced the film, it has given it a deeper, more powerful dimension\". He wanted them to compose the score for his film after listening to the band's previous studio album, Points on the Curve (1984). He was so taken with the album that he took one of the songs straight off the album, \"Wait\", and used it as part of the soundtrack. \"Wait\" plays at the end credits of the film. Every song on the soundtrack, excluding the title song and \"Wait\", was written and recorded within a two-week period. Only after Wang Chung saw a rough cut of the film did they produce the title song.An original motion picture soundtrack was released on September 30, 1985, by Geffen Records. The album contained eight tracks.

Lean also offered the role to Kenneth More, who was unsure about whether the public would accept him in the part and turned it down. It was a decision More later regarded as \"the greatest mistake I ever made professionally\". Lean had completed a script in collaboration with Mason and cast Keiko Kishi as the girl, but disagreed with Alexander Korda, who was to have produced the film and the project fell through.Lean had already entered into discussions with Sam Spiegel, regarding a film version of Pierre Boulle's novel The Bridge on the River Kwai. After Korda's death in 1956, the rights to Mason's novel were sold to Rank Film Productions, who assigned the project to the team of Betty Box and Ralph Thomas.Filming took place on location in India in early 1958, with Dirk Bogarde in the main role.Ralph Thomas later said he thought Sir John Davis of Rank \"very bravely\" authorised location-filming in India \"because he trusted David Lean's judgement that it was a splendid book. It was a real three-handkerchief picture, which I thoroughly enjoyed making, and Dirk was very good in it.\""

Returning home in a dense fog through Grosvenor Square, Kit is startled by a disembodied male voice that threatens to kill her. The following day, Tony's assistant, Daniel Graham, notifies Tony that he has been looking at the books of Tony's company, and it appears a large sum of money has been embezzled from their firm.\nWhen Kit returns to her apartment, she notices a gaunt man staring at her. Moments later, she is nearly injured by a falling girder outside the building, but is pushed out of harm's way by Brian Younger, a contractor working on the renovation. Later, Kit receives a menacing phone call from the same voice she heard in the park, again threatening to kill her. When neighbor Peggy observes Kit's anxiety, she phones Tony who brings Kit to file a report with the Scotland Yard. Inspector Byrnes dismisses the incident as Kit seeking attention from her husband.\nKit's aunt, Bea Coleman, arrives in London to visit her. Kit confides in Bea about the recent events and is comforted by her. Shortly after, Tony cancels the couple's planned trip to Venice due to a business obligation. Kit receives another obscene call that Tony attempts to listen in on from another phone, but Kit hangs up, unable to endure the caller's verbal abuse. The next day, Kit becomes trapped in the building's elevator due to a malfunction. A shadowy man approaches the elevator and enters the car through its roof, terrifying Kit, before it is revealed to be Brian, attempting to rescue her. Brian takes Kit to a local pub, where he recounts a near-death experience while he served in World War II. \nSeveral days later, Kit attends a ballet with Tony and Bea, along with Malcolm, the son of Kit's maid Nora, and Charles Manning, the treasurer of Tony's company. During the ballet, Malcolm makes vague threats toward Kit, requesting additional money to help care for his mother. Kit demurs him, insisting she will ensure Nora is cared for. Tony intervenes, and passively accuses Malcolm of being responsible for the menacing phone calls Kit has received.\nOver the ensuing days, Kit becomes increasingly paranoid. After receiving another call, Kit encounters the mysterious gaunt man in her apartment, and screams in horror. Brian hears her screams and rushes to her apartment, but no intruder is located when police arrive. The next day, Kit spots the gaunt man again on the street and is pushed in front of a bus, nearly killing her. Kit begs Peggy to lie to Tony that she has heard the voice of Kit's stalker on the phone, hoping to legitimize her story so that police will take her claims seriously. Peggy complies, but is rebuffed when Tony informs her that the phone has been disconnected all day.\nTony and Bea become convinced Kit is delusional, and send her to a psychiatrist. Tony finally agrees to embark on the trip to Venice. Before Tony leaves for a business meeting, the caller phones again. Tony has Byrnes surround the apartment building, hoping to catch the assailant, and pretends to leave. Meanwhile, Brian spots the gaunt man in a pub and follows him. In the darkened apartment, Kit is confronted by the gaunt man, but Tony attacks and incapacitates him. Kit assumes she is safe, only for Tony to reveal that he and Peggy conspired to torment Kit before killing her and staging her death as a suicide, with the motive of inheriting Kit's fortune to repay Tony's business debts. As Tony attempts to murder Kit, the gaunt man reveals that he is in fact Peggy's estranged husband, who learned of her affair with Tony, and wants to kill her. Kit escapes the apartment by walking along the construction girders and scaffolding outside the balcony, just as Byrnes and Brian arrive. Brian helps Kit back into the apartment, where Byrnes reveals he discovered Tony's guilt after tapping their phone."

Elaine is embarrassed by David Puddy having a fur coat, so when she is placed in charge of the coats, Elaine secretly throws Puddy's fur coat out the window. She later finds out she dispatched Joe's near-identical coat instead, and Joe demands Elaine buy him a new coat.\nKramer and Newman reverse the peepholes on their apartment doors to spot any ambushes inside their rooms. When the super, Silvio, learns they did this without his authorization, he assumes Newman instigated it. He only refrains from evicting Newman because Kramer speaks on his behalf. Kramer notices Newman is having an affair with Silvio's wife, and realizes he and Newman will both be evicted if Silvio finds out.\nAt Kramer's suggestion, Jerry throws out his wallet and just folds his bills together, saving pocket space. He mocks George for having a wallet that is so stuffed with coupons that it gives him back pain. The massage chair is delivered to George by mistake. When he discovers how good it is for his back pain, he delays giving it to Joe. When Jerry complains about having to carry around his girlfriend's things, Elaine gives him a European carry-all, which resembles a purse.\nKramer mentions to Elaine that Newman recovered Joe's fur coat from a tree. She tries to convince Newman to give her Joe's coat, but he has already given it to Silvio's wife. When he learns of the fur coat, Silvio threatens to evict Kramer and Newman over the affair. To save himself, Kramer claims the fur coat is Jerry's, and gets Jerry to wear it in front of Silvio. Silvio believes him until Elaine walks up and asks why Jerry is wearing Joe's coat. Silvio then plots revenge on Joe. A thief snatches Jerry's carry-all. Jerry calls to a policeman, but the policeman does not know what a European carry-all is, so Jerry has to describe it as his \"purse\".\nElaine, Jerry, and Kramer back out of participating in their chair gift (Elaine because Joe demanded she buy him a new coat, Jerry because Joe criticized his taste in music, and Kramer because he has no recollection of agreeing to the gift). George plans to return the chair. When he puts a tear-away phone number for a free guitar lesson in his already overstuffed wallet, much of the contents burst out and blow away, including the receipt.\nSilvio ambushes Joe from inside his room with a sock of pennies.

However, Lisa is suspicious about the cable hookup, and after a Sunday school lesson about the existence and nature of Hell, she fears that Homer is violating the Eighth of the Ten Commandments\u2014\"Thou shalt not steal\"\u2014and will go to Hell when he dies.\nAfter seeing other examples of common thievery everywhere, Lisa visits Reverend Lovejoy. He dissuades Lisa from reporting her father's illegal cable hookup to the police since the Fifth Commandment states one must \"honor thy father and thy mother\", but instead advises her to lead by example and refuse to watch programs via the cable hookup. Marge pleads with Homer to either disconnect the cable or pay for it, but he refuses. However, after the cable man offers to sell him a stolen car stereo and attempts to break into Ned's house, Homer barricades his windows in fear. Bart one evening discovers a porn channel called \"Top Hat Entertainment\", despite fear of punishment from Homer, who spots him watching it. Homer lets Bart off with a warning, telling him not to watch the channel again. Bart pretends to agree to this and behind Homer's back charges the neighborhood children 50 cents to watch the cable porn channel, but just as it begins Homer catches him and sends him to his room as punishment.\nHomer invites his co-workers and bar buddies to watch Drederick Tatum fight for the World Heavyweight Championship during a cable-TV boxing match. Unfortunately for Homer, Mr. Burns also finds out and decides to attend the gathering to watch the match. Whilst preparing for the viewing party, Homer is forced to hastily hide items he stole from some of his guests, namely office supplies from the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant and beer mugs from Moe's. When Lisa announces she will boycott the screening, Homer banishes her to the lawn, where she is joined by Marge and Maggie. Eventually Homer's conscience bothers him and he begrudgingly chooses not to watch the fight, dragging Bart outside with him. When his friends leave, Homer hesitantly cuts the cable hookup over Bart's objections. However, he ends up cutting off power to his neighborhood while trying to find the right wire to cut the cable."

It was originally going to be named \"Homer vs. the 8th Commandment\", but the writers decided to include Lisa in the title because they wanted the cast to feel as if all their characters were equally represented on the show. The episode is based on the Eighth Commandment (\"thou shall not steal\"), which is one of the Ten Commandments. The Simpsons writer Al Jean said that \"whenever people come up to me and say that The Simpsons is just sort of this outrageous show that has no moral center, I always point them to this [episode], where Homer gets an illegal cable hook-up (which many people have done in real life) and suffers enormous consequences.\"The Simpsons writer Mike Reiss feels that episodes such as \"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\" are his favorite episodes to write because they have a \"solid theme or an issue\" (in this case, religion and theft), that one can \"discuss endlessly and just have it present itself in so many different ways\". Producer Jeff Martin said the writers tried to use a \"very strict construction of the Eighth Commandment,\" considering cable theft to be \"essentially a victimless crime\". \"Homer vs. the 8th Commandment\" was produced at a time when illegal cable hookups were becoming commonplace in many homes. This episode later inspired the season four episode \"Homer the Heretic\", in which Homer stops going to church on Sundays. Based on the Fourth Commandment, \"remember the Sabbath and keep it holy\", that episode originated when Jean commented to Reiss, \"We had a lot of luck with Homer stealing cable, so maybe we could look to other commandments?\"The episode marks the debut appearance of the character Troy McClure, voiced by Phil Hartman. McClure was based on the typical \"washed-up\" Hollywood actor, and B movie actors Troy Donahue and Doug McClure served as inspiration for his name and certain character aspects. According to show creator Matt Groening, Hartman was cast in the role due to his ability to pull \"the maximum amount of humor\" out of any line he was given. McClure's visual appearance is similar to that of Hartman himself. McClure became a recurring character on the show after \"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\", but was retired in 1998 after Hartman's death. In addition to McClure, Hartman also provided the voice of the cable guy. The character Drederick Tatum, one of the boxers in the boxing match Homer and his friends watch, also makes his first appearance on the show in this episode. His physical appearance was based on the American boxer Mike Tyson, and he was named after a real boxer Simpsons writer George Meyer had seen."

DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson felt that \"[The episode] helped establish the show's reputation as a master lampooner of pop culture.

Weinman described \"Homer vs. Lisa and the Eighth Commandment\" as \"the first truly great episode\u2014the one that established The Simpsons as the funniest and most multi-layered sitcom around. The story of Homer stealing cable was an excuse for dozens of parodies of early '90s cable TV, but it was also a story about Homer and his daughter and an examination of how we rationalize little acts of theft in our daily lives.\"The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called the episode a \"skilful demonstration of a moral dilemma that must have plagued millions since the inception of cable TV\". Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, wrote that \"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\" is \"one of the many demonstrations that while [The Simpsons] may have pushed the censorship envelope for its day, it remained moral to its core. The running satire of cable programs is also quite amusing.\" The episode won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour).

Among those on his paper route is an old man named Herbert who is sexually attracted to Chris. Chris later gives his crush a present, but his clumsiness and over-eagerness scares her off. Nevertheless, he decides to retain the paper route. Shortly thereafter, however, Chris witnesses a robbery at a convenience store, and his bike ends up being stolen by the burglar as a getaway vehicle (even though he takes the bike but runs on foot). Later, at the police station, Chris identifies the thief from a police lineup. However, Peter shows up and tells the thief (unknowingly) that he is here to pick up Chris who was going to \"finger the guy who held up the convenience store\" and then proceeds to give the thief a picture of Chris, along with various other personal information. When the thief escapes and swears vengeance on Chris, the family is placed in the Witness Protection Program where they are relocated to Bumblescum, a tiny town in the deep South, to which Meg complains, although Lois remains somewhat optimistic.\nDeciding to embrace the South, Peter decorates his car like the General Lee, though he fails to roll the passenger window down for Brian when beckoning him to enter. He then becomes sheriff with Brian as his deputy, although the two neglect their responsibilities in order to drink. Stewie joins a hillbilly jug band, Meg becomes the most successful and popular student among her classmates (besting Oinky the Pig), and Chris makes a new friend named Sam.\nLater, when Peter interferes with a Civil War reenactment, claiming the North won the war, despite how they were being portrayed in the play, Sam's dad says Chris and Sam can no longer be friends and Peter and Brian have to answer to the civil war survivors. Not knowing of this, Sam unexpectedly kisses Chris, and Chris assumes Sam is gay. As Chris writes in a journal about what happened with Sam, Brian hears the story (as Chris was speaking out what he wrote), and he explains that kissing Sam seemingly felt right.\nWhen the two meet again, Chris explains to Sam that even though he is flattered that Sam likes him, he is not interested in a romantic relationship and feels that they are probably better off as just friends. Just before the two go swimming, Chris finds out that Sam is a girl, and due to his bad experiences around girls, Chris now feels awkward around Sam. At a party that is held that night, Sam explains to Chris that he had no problem talking to her, when he thought she was a guy, so she tells Chris to think of her as a boy who he can make out with.\nAfter the FBI agents who were hired to look over the Griffins home in Quahog accidentally reveal the location of the family (telling the criminal where Meg was, but not Chris), the criminal tracks the family down in Bumblescum, and attempts to kill Chris. During the confrontation, however, the criminal is shot and killed by Sam's father.\nWith the criminal gone, the Griffins return to Quahog with Chris having to leave Sam behind. Once they are home, they realize that someone had left 113 messages on their answering machine, all of which turn out to be from Herbert, who is looking for Chris."

Harry, a former war correspondent, accepts the attractive deal and sets off to Soviet Russia only to fall in love with a country quite different from the picture shown by the \"free press\" in its Cold War adversary. Back in the United States, Harry finds himself torn by a dilemma between his consciousness as an honest journalist, and the menacing pressure of his superiors, forcing him to write a convenient untruth.Keeping its ideological design in mind, The Russian Question remains a sophisticated and objective, if somewhat critical portrayal of American Cold War political society. Unlike many other Soviet propaganda films, Romm's drama takes on an American perspective, only showing the Soviet Union discussed in the movie for a short combination of shots.

It was directed by Fritz Lang and released in 1922. The film is silent and would be followed by the sound sequels The Testament of Dr. Mabuse (1933) and The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse (1960).\nIt is four and a half hours long and divided into two parts, originally released a month apart: Der gro\u00dfe Spieler: Ein Bild der Zeit and Inferno: Ein Spiel von Menschen unserer Zeit. The title, Dr. Mabuse, der Spieler, makes use of three meanings of the German Der Spieler which can mean gambler, puppeteer, or actor. The character Dr. Mabuse, who disguises himself, manipulates people, and is a notorious gambler, embodies all senses of the word. Therefore, the Player might be a more appropriate translation of the title.\nThe film is included in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, being the first of five Lang films to be included."

        "content": "Production of the first part of Dr. Mabuse the Gambler began while the novel on which it is based, Norbert Jacques' Dr. Mabuse, der Spieler was still being serialized. The film made a number of important changes from the book version. In the book the characters engage in constant soliloquies which would not have adapted well to film, particularly a silent film which would have required many intertitles to make that work. The film also eliminated a subplot in which Mabuse's actions are shown to be motivated by a desire to create his own country within South America. Film historian David Kalat points out that by eliminating reference to Mabuse's motivation Lang starts to dehumanize the character, which helped lead to the character becoming a franchise. But Kalat also notes that this eliminates the irony of the fact that Mabuse was seen by many viewers as a representation of aspects of Adolf Hitler, and many Nazis actually fled to South America after World War II.Lang and von Harbou also added some elements to the film that were not in the novel. One of Mabuse's key skills in the film is as a counterfeiter, but in the novel he never engaged in this. Mabuse's role in counterfeiting money adds to the social subtext and to the themes of the film. The film's opening, a 20-minute tour de force introducing the myth of Mabuse, was also not in the novel. The introduction starts with Mabuse shuffling a deck of photos like playing cards which will determine which disguise he will use that day and culminates with Mabuse manipulating a stock market crash. Kalat traces the inspiration for this sequence to Louis Feuillade's 1913 Fant\u00f4mas II: Juve contre Fant\u00f4mas (Juve vs. Fant\u00f4mas). The ending to the second part of Dr. Mabuse is also unique to the film.The film incorporates a number of special effects such as animation and superimpositions. One aspect that was cheered upon the film's original release was the nighttime scene of the automobile chase in which Wenk chases Mabuse, which David Kalat called the most successful execution of such nighttime photography to that time.It was during the production of this film that Lang and von Harbou began their affair which would ultimately result in their marriage. Although von Harbou was married to Klein-Rogge at the time, their separation was amicable and did not create a problem for the film."

        "content": "A key theme of the film is the dissolution of German society after World War I. The film portrays but exaggerates the difficult conditions during the period making the film's world a dystopia. The worthless counterfeit money created by Mabuse reflects the nearly worthless Deutsche Mark during the hyperinflation resulting from the Weimar Republic printing excessive money to pay war reparations. The stock market swings, gambling parlors and miserable living conditions for poor people depicted in the film were also reflections of conditions in Germany at the time.The character of Dr. Mabuse can also be seen as depiction of \"the power of evil or a distorted inner psyche\". Lang scholar Paul Jensen interpreted Mabuse as \"a symbol to unite all the negative factors in Germany at the time\". The film depicts difficult problems such as rampant crime, worthless money and a volatile stock market as thus being under the control of a single man. Bernd Widdig points out that while Dr. Mabuse is not an anti-Semitic film, aspects of Mabuse's character may have reflected contemporary stereotypes of Jews, especially since he acts in stereotypically Jewish roles such as psychoanalyst, banker, peddler and revolutionary, and consistent with the views on Jews of some contemporary Germans his manipulations were responsible for problems in society. A contemporary Nazi critic wrote that Mabuse is \"a quintessential Jewish figure\" who goes through time with the singular goal of \"mastery of the world\" regardless of the consequences to others and whose descent into insanity caused his crimes to go unpunished in what the Nazi critic described as \"the typical case of the Jewish criminal\". On the other hand, Mabuse with his hypnotic power over the masses in pursuit of evil has also been seen as a foreshadowing of Adolf Hitler. In the sequel The Testament of Dr. Mabuse the link between the Mabuse character and the Nazis is made stronger. Lang stated that he viewed Mabuse as a Nietzschean \u00dcbermensch. Lang also saw Mabuse's character as emblematic of a certain kind of money-accumulator in Weimar Germany referred to as a \"Raffke\". The producer of Dr. Mabuse, Erich Pommer, saw the film as a depiction of the contemporary conflict between the liberal conservatives and the Marxist Spartacists in which the Mabuse character represented the Spartacists, yet another view saw populist themes in the film.Another theme in the film is surveillance and seeing without being seen. Yet another theme is that of being versus seeming, portrayed through Mabuse's disguises and through buildings whose interiors seem inconsistent with their exteriors."

But when the full length version finally was released in the United States at the 1973 New York Film Festival, Times critic Nora Sayre praised it as being \"something very good\" and \"possibly the hit of the festival\".Variety praised the film's plot for its \"speed and life\" while acknowledging that it can be confusing. Variety felt the best parts of the movie were the scenes between Mabuse and Von Wenk. Variety praised several of the acting performances but felt Klein-Rogge was too small to be fully effective in the role, and praised some of Lang's technical effects while criticizing the overlong intertitles. Time Out criticized the film for its \"disorganised and erratically paced\" narrative and \"shaky\" grasp of social reality but praised its \"flashes of inspiration\". Entertainment Weekly reviewer Tim Purtell rated the film an A\u2212, comparing the titular villain to those in the James Bond and Mission Impossible movies. Purtell particularly praised the \"sharp\" plot turns, \"stunning visuals\" and Klein-Rogge's performance.

Convinced he is a great writer, Brian attempts to gain the family's interest but fails to do so, they even callously disregard him. Once he arrives at the \"award ceremony\" however, he discovers that he has misunderstood the meaning of the word \"special\",  prompting him to drown his sorrows at the local bar and realize that he is not a good writer. He drives home drunk that night and accidentally runs over and kills a dog. He secretly buries the dead dog's body outside the Griffins' home and tries to keep quiet about it. Stewie, having witnessed his deed, begins to toy with Brian's guilt, eventually driving him to a state where he decides to confess to \"murder\". However, when he confesses to Joe and the Griffin family, they all laugh, saying that no one cares if a dog or any other animal is killed, especially by another animal.Outraged, Brian starts a support group, and decides to call it \"The Quahog Animal Equal Rights League\", to convince the town that the lives of animals should be of equal value to humans'. As the town citizens learn more about it, however, none of them are keen on changing their lifestyles if it means no processed meats and medical research on animals, and even become interested in how dogs taste after Brian mentions they are eaten in some cultures. Refusing to listen any further, they chase after Brian in an attempt to eat him.\nBrian realizes that if no one cares about the lives of animals, then he is worthless to the Griffin family and everyone else. Stewie finds Brian crying in the bathtub, and, seeing how upset Brian is and feeling sorry for him, Stewie successfully fakes his death by putting his collar (which Brian hadn't been wearing) on a stray and killing it in a liquor store fire. The Griffins are devastated upon learning about Brian's supposed death, and realize how close a friend he was to them. Seeing this, Stewie rushes upstairs to show Brian how much the Griffins still care about him, regardless of his species. Brian then realizes his life does have a purpose and thanks Stewie for helping him, and decides to remain hidden to let the Griffins grieve a little longer.\nMeanwhile, Quagmire accidentally knocks over a carton of Kool-Aid mix on the kitchen floor of the Griffin's house and leaves Peter to take the blame. Frustrated with having to clean Peter's messes, Lois hires a Hispanic maid named Consuela to clean their house. But Consuela quickly proves to be very stubborn, refusing to leave after her work hours and sleeping at the Griffins' house overnight, much to Peter and Lois' annoyance. They try to fire her and even bribe her to leave, but she still refuses (though she takes the money they offer her anyway). In a last-ditch attempt, Peter finally gets rid of her by tricking her into inhaling chloroform on a handkerchief, and leaves her in a basket on Joe's front porch.\nAt the end, Peter lets the viewers know that everyone at Family Guy respects all living beings and assures the viewers that no animals were harmed in the making of the episode, but they are going hurt the feelings of an Italian opera singer by prematurely dropping the curtain on his performance - this is then shown onscreen."

The sets included brief audio commentaries by Seth MacFarlane and various crew and cast members for several episodes, a collection of deleted scenes, a special mini-feature which discussed the process behind animating \"Road to the Multiverse\", and a mini-feature entitled Family Guy Karaoke.\nIn addition to the regular cast, anchor and political commentator Chris Matthews, voice actor Fred Tatasciore, opera singer Nathan Gunn, radio personality Eddie Sotelo and Kel MacFarlane, webmaster of the Seth MacFarlane fan site, guest starred in the episode.

        "content": "In the opening scene of the episode, Stewie is seen going through Brian's internet history, which includes searches about himself on the internet search engine Google. Later, after going to the bar to drink, Brian talks to Bill, the father from The Family Circus syndicated comic strip. After Bill tells him he should have tried harder on writing his book, Brian responds by yelling that all Bill does is \"judge\" other people, and demands for him to go home and \"fuck [his] wife in the face\", to which Bill agrees. This is also later recognized by Peter the next day, when he is seen reading the funnies, and murmurs to himself, \"this is a very shocking Family Circus.\"\nNews anchor and political commentator Chris Matthews' show entitled Hardball with Chris Matthews is referenced by Stewie when he suggests Brian is getting a big head, with the guest, United States Senator Harry Reid, then appearing on Matthews' forehead, suggesting Matthews is self-centered. After Reid continues to interrupt him, however, Matthews cuts to actor Kurtwood Smith, in which Matthews appears on Smith's forehead instead.Once Consuela is hired as the family maid, she first begins to annoy Peter by listening to stereotypical Latin music played loudly on a portable radio, in which the singer repeats the Spanish phrase \"\u00a1Muchos horn-os!\" which literally translates to \"many ovens\" but within the context of the show is actually meant to be Spanglish for \"many horns.\" In Consuela's final appearance in the episode, she is seen watching a commercial, which parodies local commercials urging viewers to hire a lawyer if they are in a car accident.In an attempt to try to prove that an animal has the same rights as humans, Brian starts an advocacy group, and is suggested by Lois to join PETA, but she is unable to enunciate the word differently from how she pronounces \"Peter,\" leading her husband to become confused. The end of the gag has Chris stating his belief that Betty White is a member of the organization, with his wording prompting Peter to yell, \"That doesn't even make sense!\"  Brian goes on to create a public service announcement regarding animal rights, one of which involves a dog being \"tortured\" by having to listen to the radio show All Things Considered on National Public Radio, which the dog's owner leaves on for him before leaving the house."

The episode also acquired a 4.4 rating in the 18\u201349 demographic, beating The Simpsons, The Cleveland Show and American Dad!, but was ultimately edged out slightly by The Simpsons in total viewership.Reviews of the episode were highly positive, citing the Brian and Stewie storyline as a \"solid attempt to tell a good story,\" and the Consuela scenes as \"terrific.\" Ahsan Haque of IGN also noted that \"the writers deserved some credit\" for the episode, saying that, in comparison to past episodes the episode did not \"come across as a haphazardly assembled string of [random] jokes.\" Jason Hughes of TV Squad also found the Consuela scenes to be \"hilarious,\" but found the final scene to be \"strangely [...] uncomfortable,\" expecting Meg to be pushed out of the family hug. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club praised the handling of Brian's character in the episode, and called the Peter and PETA gag \"pretty cheap, but quite funny,\" giving the episode a B rating overall.In February 2010, for \"rais[ing] public awareness of animal issues\", \"Dog Gone\" won a Genesis Award for television comedy, winning over South Park episode 'Whale Whores\" and Monk episode \"Mr. Monk and the Dog\". In a post on PETA's official blog, Amanda Schinke, however, was highly critical of the episode for its \"myriad of violent deaths of cartoon dogs.\" In addition, she called for the show to \"hire [writers] who can generate material that doesn't make us roll our eyes.\""

Sergeant Bill Thatcher (Bill Boyd) is left in charge of a small rear guard of four men to cover the battalion's retreat before it is cut off. During heavy shelling, Bill tries to comfort his men after each is wounded. The first, \"Bud\" (Russell Gleason), relates his story of how he joined the military, leaving the family farm to enlist, despite his mother's pleas for him not to become involved in foreign conflicts. As he finishes his story, he dies.\nThe second doughboy, Lew Cavanaugh (Lew Cody), is a New York playboy who used enlistment as a way to have a final night of pleasure with one of his conquests, never realizing that he would die on a French battlefield. The third American, the unsoldierly Jim Mobley (James Gleason), is not as badly wounded as the other two soldiers and tells his story of his wife's displeasure after he announces his intention to enlist and his own consternation at his inability explain to her why. Thatcher then relates his own story, where he was engaged to a German immigrant back in the United States but did not wed her due to their differences over the \"Great War\".\nShortly after, the Germans attack again, during which Bill and Jim defend their position and blow up a bridge to cover the retreat of their battalion, but are badly wounded. A German soldier tries to bayonet the unconscious Bill but is stopped by another soldier. Both are captured and sent to a German hospital, where Bill is discovered by his erstwhile fianc\u00e9, Katherine (Lissi Arna). She saves his life by persuading the German doctor to allow Bill, slowly bleeding to death but not allowed a transfusion because too many German patients are in need of one, to be transfused with her blood. After the armistice, with Bill recovered and decorated along with Jim for the defense of Nevremont, they celebrate the end of the fighting with Katherine."

        "content": "The film was announced as part of Path\u00e9 Exchange's 30-picture schedule for 1930\u201331 in February 1930. It was considered the premier film of Path\u00e9's schedule for the season. Boyd was attached to the project by the end of February, as part of his new deal with Path\u00e9, in which he would only appear in Path\u00e9 \"specials\". Beyond Victory was to be the first film of that new deal. James Gleason was added to the cast in a featured role in March 1930. It was the first film for Gleason under his new exclusive long-term contract with Path\u00e9. At the same time, it was revealed that John Robinson would be helming the film. Robert Armstrong was attached to the picture in early April. Also in early April, it was announced that Mauri Grashin had been signed as screenwriter to a long-term contract by Path\u00e9, and Beyond Victory would be his first project. In June 1930, it was reported that Dorothy Burgess had been signed for a featured role in the film, and Zasu Pitts involvement with the picture as a knife-throwing entertainer was revealed, along with James Gleason's participation. In mid-June, Charles O'Loughlin was announced as the sound engineer on the project, although the final version included work from four sound engineers. The Film Daily reported that the film's producer, E.B. Derr, in conjunction with the director, John Robertson, took an unusual step and had each sequence in the film written by a different screenwriter. The writers included James Seymour, James Gleason, Lynn Riggs, Thomas Lennon, Mauri Grashin, and Garret Fort. The concept was to have five independent stories intertwined around a central theme. In Glason's adaptation, he wrote a role into the final version of the script for himself. By early May pre-production on the film was almost completed.  And production on the film had begun by the middle of May. Also in May, the film was scheduled to be released on July 13, 1930.In early June, Robert Armstrong was replaced by Lew Cody. Armstrong was delayed on the production of Railroad Man. By June 15, 1930, the cast had grown to include William Boyd, Fred Scott, James Gleason, Russell Gleason, June Collyer, Helen Twelvetrees, Zasu Pitts, Purnell Pratt, and Bert Roach. The following week, Richard Tucker was added to the cast. Production on the film was almost complete by the end of June. On June 26, the final cast list was reported. Additions to the cast were: William Holden, E.H. Calvert, Fred Walton, Wade Boteler, Rockliffe Fellowes, Helen Baxter, George Stone, Elinor Millard, Ed Deering, Bert Sprotte, Conrad Seidemann, Paul Weigle, and Charles Giblyn. Millard was a stage actress, and this movie was her film debut. In addition to the unusual script development strategy used by Path\u00e9, they also employed a U.S. Army Colonel, Frank S. Long, as a technical advisor on the film. A new type of silencer for the camera was employed on the picture, allowing a close-up of Boyd's hand signing a document to pick up the pen's scratching noise on the paper. The film included actual war footage from Path\u00e9's film library, which at the time had one of the most extensive collections of World War I footage. While the film's main cinematography was done by Norbert Brodine, William Dietz was hired to do some special trick photography.By July 11, 1930, production on the film was completed. By the end of the month, the picture was in the editing room. However, on July 23 it was announced that the film was being shelved for the time being, with portions to be re-shot. By August 21, the film was being advertised in major industry journals. In the released version of the film, scenes with Helen Twelvetrees and June Collyer were completely cut. In October it was announced that the film was scheduled for release on November 30, with the film undergoing some large re-shoots under the direction of E.H. Griffith. However, the film went back into the editing room in early December. The film's release date was eventually pushed back to be included in the 1931 release schedule. Path\u00e9 cut its planned 20 films for the 1930\u201331 schedule to 9, with Beyond Victory scheduled as the last of the nine. The reason cited was Path\u00e9's acquisition by RKO Pictures. Beyond Victory was one of three Path\u00e9 films which were purchased outright by RKO."

Sheltering in a deserted farmhouse, they are awaiting the return of their Sergeant who has ventured out in an attempt to locate their unit. The three soldiers are Tom, a world-weary cynical veteran, John, a middle-class educated thinker who despises war and Cliff, an eager soldier who loves his work. All three are highly trained professional killers who, regardless of their own personal thoughts, do not hesitate to perform their duties.\nTwo German soldiers approach the farmhouse and the paratroopers dispatch them both. The second of the enemy attackers is stalked by the paratroopers who virtually toy with their victim before John kills him, finishing the man off up close, although the experience renders him sick. As the three men eat a meal, they are surprised and captured by a third German named Helmut, a paratrooper like themselves. The British soon turn the tables and capture Helmut but the latter, who speaks English, manages to manipulate his captors into keeping him alive. The group leave the house in search of their Sergeant whom they eventually find dead in the woods, his throat cut. The men continue on, trying to find their way back to Allied lines. They come across a farmhouse, where a trio of Germans are sheltering. The paratroopers cautiously approach and shoot them, only to find that the Germans are already dead.\nAfter spending the night in the house, the group continues their walk back to the British lines, only to run into a German patrol. In the ensuing battle, all of the Germans are killed but Cliff is fatally wounded. John and Tom reach the frontline, taking their prisoner Helmut with them but nearby British troops mistake them all to be German and open fire, mortally wounding Tom. Both injured themselves, John and Helmut take cover in a muddy ditch. There, John decides to kill Helmut with a small skewer he has always carried with him. Delirious with exhaustion and trauma, John staggers into the open, yelling that he is a pacifist before the British troops open fire again, shooting him dead."

As with The Penthouse [1967], Collinson seems not to know when enough is enough, and the result is a film in which the director's technical self-indulgence undermines some promising ideas. ... Collinson makes effective use of natural sound to underline the ritual nature of the killing, and he is well supported by Brian Probyn's colour photography, with its emphasis on neutral colours like green and brown and its constantly changing focus. But where he goes badly wrong is that instead of underplaying the deaths that are the end result of the soldiers' games, he gives them an entirely false \u2013 and worse, self-consciously artistic \u2013 emphasis.  ... Charles Wood's script has the same fault, developing the relationship between the paratroopers and their wily prisoner with some subtlety, but in its succession of interior monologues and would-be significant staccato exchanges striking the same exhibitionist note as Collinson's tasteless insistence on ramming home his message.Renata Adler, reviewing the film's release in The New York Times in 1968 wrote: \"There are some excellent scenes ... But the screenplay is unendurable. Smug, dimestore Existential ...stale, self-important and tough ... No characterization ... One for the English antiwar cheapshot satire brigade\".Mark Connelly wrote (in 2003): \"Critics hated the film, finding in it much the same faults as they identified in The Charge of the Light Brigade [1968]\". (Charles Wood wrote the screenplay for both films) \"They were confused by the fact that it was an anti-war film that celebrated some of the values of war and army life. Wood was showing, as he did in The Charge, that war has a complex hold over the minds and imaginations of humans. That although it is ultimately an awful, destructive, wasteful process, it has inspired men and motivated them intellectually and emotionally\"."

Every item in the auction is sold to an English widow named Edith Knickertwist, who is bidding over the phone. When the auction is over, Bart reveals that he was the real Mrs. Knickertwist and that there is no money for the school. Frustrated over Bart's latest prank and pressured by his supervisor Superintendent Chalmers, Principal Skinner challenges Chalmers to take over Bart's education. Chalmers accepts and immediately gives Bart his own lesson plan, which primarily consists of former U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt. He makes Bart interested in the subject by talking about Roosevelt's heroic and rebellious nature.  Classmates Milhouse, Nelson, Jimbo, Kearney and Dolph soon join Bart in his education.\nWith the success of his lessons, Chalmers plans to take them all on a field trip to Springfield Forest, in which Roosevelt left one of his spectacles. The field trip does not go well, however, as Nelson breaks his arm when he tries to reach for the spectacles. Since it was an unauthorized field trip, Nelson's mother threatens to sue the school for medical expenses, which leads to Chalmers getting fired. In order to save Chalmers' job, Bart and his friends, who now go by the name \"The Brotherhood of the Spectacles\", take over the school in a hostage situation and stand up for the teacher who made a meaningful impact to them. They lock all of the teachers out of the school and demand that Chalmers get reinstated. A SWAT team prepares to storm the school, before Chalmers walks up to convince Bart to stop. Luckily, Chief Wiggum accidentally drops his gun, knee-capping the school representative State Comptroller Atkins, who thereafter agrees to reinstate Chalmers because they can recover the money lost in the previous lawsuit with a new lawsuit against the police department. With Chalmers' job saved, Bart continues his lessons with him."

These three other animated shows were part of a crossover event, called Night of the Hurricane, in which they shared the same storyline.

Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club gave this episode a \"B\" rating and commented that \"The Simpsons episodes that strive to have a little heart without going overboard are generally going to work better than the random-gag episodes, at least at this point in the storied history of The Simpsons, and 'Bart Stops To Smell The Roosevelts' has enough wee little heart to see this episode through\", but further wrote that \"there were a number of jokes that didn't work, Milhouse's final scene in particular, but the episode had a steady stream of gags to push through the lean times. And that's all we can ask for.\" Ology's Josh Harrison was also positive and gave the episode a rating of seven out of ten, while commenting that he \"thought this was a definite downgrade from the season premiere in terms of sheer comedic value, but the sincerity of Bart's educational experience, combined with the enthusiasm of his mad quest for justice, definitely made this one a winner.\"The couch gag for the episode was acclaimed by television critics. Amid Amidi of Cartoon Brew called the opening revolutionary and explained that \"in 35 short and sweet seconds, he liberates the animation of The Simpsons from years of graphic banality.\" He continued: \"The visual look of the show, which has been so carefully controlled by its producers, becomes a giddy and unrestrained playground for graphic play, and the balance of creative authority is shifted from the writers' room to the animators in one fell swoop.\" When comparing the segment to Banksy's, Amidi concluded that it is \"in fact, far more subversive because he focuses almost exclusively on making a pictorial statement, relegating the show's dominant literary elements to the back seat.\" Similarly, Television Blend's Katey Rich wrote that she appreciates \"The Simpsons always being willing to push the envelope in different ways\", but admitted that it would take her \"some time to get the gangly-legged Marge Simpson and the leering Homer Simpson out of [her] brain.\"Tim Long was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Writing in Animation at the 64th Writers Guild of America Awards for his script to this episode."

However, she noticed that some plot points, like Gary's death, could only be explained by Kai's madness, \"because it otherwise makes absolutely no sense\".Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a 6 out of 10, with a mixed review. He said \"A week out from the finale, Cult revealed that Kai was never the person we'd come to know, even in flashbacks. Instead, he was a bitter woman hater who was most definitely not pretending to be a woman hater for the sake of a twist that could have flipped the show on its ear. With increasing paranoia and drug use, Kai went from a man leading an ambitious and lethal social experiment to... just another unremarkable trolling bigot.\""

The Doctor has the military leaders use coordinated attacks on the Monks, as a show of strength, but the Monks easily deflect them. The Doctor, Bill, and Nardole soon join the leaders as they negotiate with the Monks. Using the computer running their simulations (\"Extremis\"), the Monks show that the Earth will become lifeless within a year. They offer humanity their help to stop a pending cataclysmic disaster, but only if they \"consent\". The Doctor warns that this consent would have unknown but everlasting consequences. The Secretary-General offers his consent, but the Monks disintegrate him, saying he gave it out of fear, not \"love\".\nThe Doctor realises the Monks are misdirecting them to believe a military disaster is imminent, and instead suspects the threat is biological. He and Nardole find several laboratories performing bacterial work and briefly override their internal camera systems to determine which one the Monks are watching. Bill stays behind as the Doctor and Nardole travel in the TARDIS to the lab.\nThrough a series of inconsequential events, two scientists have accidentally created a super-bacterium capable of breaking down all living organisms, and it is about to be vented into the atmosphere.

However, he becomes trapped inside, unable to see a combination lock to free himself, use his sonic screwdriver on it, or get Nardole's assistance. He is forced to admit to Bill he is blind.\nBill, representing the Doctor's authority, offers her consent to the Monks, insisting they restore the Doctor's sight. The Monks accept, as this consent came from her love for the Doctor. The Doctor regains his vision and escapes the lab, while the Monks assert their control of Earth."

One could have done without the old tramp, his Aladdin's cave, and the sentimental subplot in which he figures; but at least all this provides a picaresque framework through which the acid little morality play about innocence deceived (where the innocent becomes the deceiver) rings out all the more wittily and bitterly, beautifully played by Victor Henry and Susan George. Above all, directing mercifully straight and without a psychedelic in sight, Christopher Morahan allows his excellent supporting cast to make the most of the often witty dialogue. Particularly good are Jack Shepherd ... Anna Cropper as the bovine Sis,  ... and Clare Kelly as the mother-in-law, somehow managing to make \"Will you have a glass of sherry?\" sound like a whole squad of nails being driven into the marital coffin.\"Variety wrote: \"Henry brings some humor and guts to the anti-hero's role and Jack Shepherd, top featured as his mate, is a laconic, personable newcomer. The shrewish mother (Clare Kelly) is an overwritten role, and others brought in have little substance or relevance to the main issue.  ... Heroine Susan George gives a subdued performance, pleasant but pallid. Miss George is being built up as one of the new young hopefuls and may well have what it takes, given less cardboard roles. Director Christopher Morahan ... gives the film little spark, but technically, despite the drab settings, the film just lacks wit and depth.\""

Facing difficulties making rent, she places advertisements for a roommate, to which Camille, a teacher returning to university for his doctoral degree, responds. \u00c9milie is initially hesitant to rent to a man, but the two quickly develop a sexual relationship. They each agree that they are uninterested in becoming a couple, but \u00c9milie develops feelings for Camille and becomes frustrated when he refuses to have sex with her one night. The next day, they decide to stop having sex, and Camille romantically pursues a co-worker. When he invites that co-worker over, \u00c9milie goes to a party, takes MDMA, sleeps with a woman, and then has an anxiety attack after returning to her apartment and overhearing Camille having sex with his partner. \u00c9milie takes her jealousy and frustration (having recently lost her job) out on Camille, who decides to move in with his partner.\nAttending the same university as Camille is Nora, a 33-year-old in the second year of her undergraduate law degree. She spent most of her early adulthood working for a real estate firm owned by her uncle by marriage, with whom she had a ten-year sexual relationship. Nora has few friends and finds it difficult to relate to her younger classmates. She impulsively buys a blonde wig and attends an energetic college party wearing the wig. At the party, she is mistaken for well-known camgirl Amber Sweet, who wears a similar wig, and is harassed by fellow students until she leaves the party. The next day, Nora is mocked by students in her class who think she is Amber; she drops out shortly afterwards.\nNeeding a job, Nora applies for a position in a small real estate firm that happens to be managed by Camille, who has since broken up with his former co-worker and taken over the firm from a relative to supplement his income. Nora decides to set platonic boundaries between herself and Camille, but eventually becomes attracted to him, and they enter into a relationship. Camille re-establishes a prickly friendship with \u00c9milie, who has since become a waiter. Camille asks \u00c9milie for advice with his current relationship, but her love for him makes her unable to broach the subject. Meanwhile, Nora tracks Amber down and buys camming time with her to discuss the incident of mistaken identity. Over the course of many video chats, they become close friends.\nNora and Camille's relationship becomes strained, and they eventually part ways after a sexual encounter in which Nora dominates Camille. On the same night, \u00c9milie's grandmother dies. When \u00c9milie tells Camille that she feels unable to face her family at the funeral on the coming Sunday, Camille offers to accompany her. \u00c9milie is angered by this offer and asks Camille to either attend the funeral (and thus commit to a relationship with her) or else cut contact with her. That Sunday, Nora and Amber meet in a park. Nora faints after greeting Amber, and then asks her to kiss her. In Les Olympiades, \u00c9milie is preparing to attend the funeral alone when her apartment phone rings; it is Camille waiting for her. \u00c9milie asks Camille to explain why he has come until Camille admits that he loves her. She then hangs up the phone to join Camille outside."

        "content": "The Simpsons Movie is a 2007 American animated comedy film based on the Fox animated sitcom The Simpsons by Matt Groening. The film was directed by series veteran David Silverman and stars the series' regular cast of Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer, Pamela Hayden, and Tress MacNeille reprising their roles and Albert Brooks as the film's main antagonist, Russ Cargill, head of the Environmental Protection Agency. The film follows Homer Simpson, who irresponsibly pollutes Springfield's local lake, causing the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, to imprison the town under a giant glass dome. After he and his family escape to Alaska, they ultimately abandon Homer for his selfishness and return to Springfield to prevent the town's demolition by Cargill. Homer then works to redeem his folly by returning to Springfield himself in an effort to save it.\nAlthough previous attempts to create a Simpsons film had been made, they failed due to the lack of a script. Eventually in 2001, producers James L. Brooks, Matt Groening, Al Jean, Mike Scully and Richard Sakai began development on the film and a writing team consisting of Brooks, Groening, Jean, Scully, Ian Maxtone-Graham, George Meyer, David Mirkin, Mike Reiss, Matt Selman, John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti was assembled. They conceived numerous plot ideas, with Groening's being the one adapted. The script was rewritten over a hundred times, also continuing after work on the animation began in 2006. Consequently, hours of finished material was cut from the final release, including cameo roles from Erin Brockovich, Minnie Driver, Isla Fisher, Edward Norton, and Kelsey Grammer, who would have reprised his role as Sideshow Bob. Tom Hanks and the members of Green Day voice their own animated counterparts in the final cut of the film, while Albert Brooks, a frequent guest performer on the series, provides the voice of Cargill.\nTie-in promotions were made with several companies to promote the film's release, including Burger King and 7-Eleven, the latter of which transformed selected stores into Kwik-E-Marts. The film premiered in Springfield, Vermont, on July 21, 2007, and was released theatrically six days later on July 27 by 20th Century Fox across the United States. The Simpsons Movie grossed $536.4 million worldwide, becoming the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2007, the second-highest-grossing traditionally animated film (behind Disney's The Lion King) and the highest-grossing film based on an animated television series. The film received very positive reviews for its humor, emotional weight, writing  and callbacks to early seasons, while being nominated for numerous awards, including a Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film at the 65th Golden Globe Awards."

The pollution in the lake erodes the band's barge, causing them to sink and drown. During their memorial, Grampa Simpson has a spiritual experience and prophesies that a disaster will befall Springfield. However, only Marge takes his cryptic message seriously. Concerned about the terrible state of the environment, Lisa and her new friend Colin hold a seminar and convince the town to clean up the lake. Meanwhile, Homer dares Bart to skateboard to Krusty Burger naked, humiliating him when he is arrested. Homer follows Bart to Krusty Burger, and adopts a pig to save it from being killed by Krusty the Clown. Marge, identifying the pig as a part of the prophecy, warns Homer to get rid of it, but he refuses and names it Plopper. Homer's fawning over Plopper makes Bart, now fed up with his father's carelessness, look to their neighbor, Ned Flanders, as a father figure.\nMarge orders Homer to dispose of an overflowing silo full of Plopper's feces. Rather than dispose of it safely, as Marge had warned him to, he dumps the silo in the lake, critically polluting it.  Russ Cargill, head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), informs President Arnold Schwarzenegger of Springfield's pollution crisis and presents him with five solutions. The president randomly picks the third option: sealing Springfield off from the rest of the world under a glass dome.\nBeing trapped under the dome causes mass hysteria in Springfield, and when Homer's silo is discovered on live television, hundreds of townspeople arrive at The Simpsons' house in an attempt to lynch the family. They escape through a sinkhole hidden in Maggie's sandbox, which destroys the house, the debris trapping in the rest of the town. The family is furious at Homer for ruining their lives, but he convinces them to follow him to Alaska, where he had always planned to go if he burned every bridge in Springfield. Homer wins a truck by riding a motorcycle around a globe of death, and the family restarts their lives in a remote Alaskan cabin.\nMeanwhile, as Springfield exhausts its supplies, the townspeople begin to make cracks in the dome. Cargill, mad with power, tricks the president into ordering Springfield's destruction. The Simpsons see Tom Hanks on television advertising a \"new Grand Canyon\" on the site of Springfield. Realizing that Springfield is in danger, Marge and the kids vow to save their friends and neighbors. Homer, however, refuses to help the people who tried to kill them and storms out. When he returns the next morning, he finds his family gone, and a videotaped message from Marge explaining that they are saving Springfield without him, taped over their wedding video. An Inuit shaman helps Homer to have an epiphany about his selfishness and he vows to save the town. Meanwhile, Marge and the kids are captured by the EPA in Seattle and placed back inside the dome.\nThe EPA lowers a time bomb suspended by a rope through a hole at the top of the dome, and the townspeople plot to escape by climbing the rope. Homer returns to Springfield and descends the rope, knocking the escaping townspeople and the bomb off, inadvertently shortening its countdown and further provoking the town's ire. Homer and Bart use a motorcycle to travel up the side of the dome, and Bart throws the bomb through the hole seconds before it detonates, shattering the dome and freeing the town. Cargill attempts to kill Homer and Bart for foiling his plan, but Maggie knocks him out by dropping a rock on his head. The townspeople celebrate Homer as a hero as he's seen riding into the sunset, sharing a passionate kiss with Marge. Later, the rest of the town pitches in to rebuild the Simpsons' house."

        "content": "Al Jean described the film's message as being \"a man should listen to his wife\". In addition, the film parodies two major contemporary issues, religion and environmentalism. The theme of environmentalism is present throughout the film: in Homer's polluting of Lake Springfield, Green Day's cameo, Lisa's activism and her romance with Colin. The villainous Russ Cargill is head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Reviewer Ed Gonzalez argued the plot was a satire of the government's reaction to the effects of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans. Ian Nathan of Empire magazine criticized this focus, believing it gave the film an \"overt political agenda [which] border[s] on polemic\". James D. Bloom of Muhlenberg College commented on the \"explicitness\" of the film's \"intellectual agenda\", on this issue, shown particularly through Lisa. He wrote that the film's first post-opening credits scene, which sees Green Day fail in an attempt to engage their audience on the issue of the environment, \"sets in motion a plot expressly built around cultural agenda-setting\" and \"reflection on timely 'issues'.\"Religion is focused on in Grampa's momentary possession, and Marge believing what he said to be a message from God. Groening joked the film \"posit[s] the existence of a very active God\", when asked if he believed it was likely to offend. Mark I. Pinsky, author of The Gospel According to The Simpsons, said the film \"treats genuine faith with respect, while keeping a sharp eye out for religious pretension and hypocrisy of all kinds\". Regarding the scene where the tenants of Moe's Tavern and the Church switch locations, he believed it took the \"chance to unmask everyone's human fallibility.\" In analyzing the role of Ned Flanders, he wrote, \"It is [the] willingness of The Simpsons to depict all the different sides of us [...] that makes it so rich and funny on our complicated relationship with religion.\" Trees are a motif in the film, and they were implemented in every important or emotional scene throughout the film. The animators inserted an apple tree behind Lisa and Colin during their initial meeting, which was a reference to the biblical figures of Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden."

        "content": "Many cultural references and allusions are made throughout the film. Green Day plays \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\" on violins as their barge sinks, in a sequence parodying the film Titanic. When Bart is riding his skateboard naked, different passing objects are almost constantly covering his genitalia, a nod to similar techniques used in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery. Homer and Marge's love scene parodies many Disney films, including Cinderella, with Disney-style animals helping them undress. Originally, the music from The Wizard of Oz was used in that scene, and the fawn had white spots; these were removed because the animators felt it resembled Bambi too clearly. Bart impersonates Mickey Mouse on the train, calling himself \"the mascot of an evil corporation\". Homer plays Grand Theft Walrus, an allusion to the video game series Grand Theft Auto. In the game, his character shoots a tap-dancing penguin in reference to the film Happy Feet. The \"Spider-Pig\" song is a parody of the theme song of the 1967 Spider-Man TV series, and the name of Lisa's lecture is An Irritating Truth, a play on Al Gore's film An Inconvenient Truth. The bomb disposal robot was based on Vincent D'Onofrio's character Leonard \"Pyle\" Lawrence from the film Full Metal Jacket, who commits suicide in a similar way. At the end of the film, the crowd's celebration is similar to the conclusion of Return of the Jedi, with Carl performing exactly the same hand gestures as Lando Calrissian.The $1,000 Homer received when entering Alaska is a reference to the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend. As Homer leaves Eski-Moe's he grabs on to a passing truck and uses it to propel himself back to the house, a tribute to actor Buster Keaton, while the epiphany scene features homages to the film Brazil and the works of Salvador Dal\u00ed. Hillary Clinton appears as Itchy's vice president, while an Orc from The Lord of the Rings appears in the mob scene. A scene that was cut had Marge and the kids appear on the TV talk show The View to spread the news of Springfield's impending doom. Parts were written for the show's entire panel and the scene was planned to feature Russ Cargill having a gunfight with Joy Behar. Another dropped scene featured Moe describing Springfield's varying physical states inside the dome, one of which was the Disneyland ride Autopia. There are several references to events in previous TV episodes of The Simpsons. These include the wreckage of the ambulance from the episode \"Bart the Daredevil\" crashed into a tree next to Springfield Gorge. The Carpenters' song \"(They Long to Be) Close to You\" was used in Homer and Marge's wedding video and had also been used in several emotional moments between them in the TV series."

He added that there were no immediate plans, stating, \"We've been asked to [develop it], but we haven't. We're doing a lot of other stuff.\" In December 2014, just prior to the broadcast of the episode \"The Man Who Came to Be Dinner\", Jean wrote on Twitter that the episode (which had been produced in 2012 and was originally set to air in May 2013) had been held back by himself and Brooks because it was being considered for adaptation into a sequel film as the episode was \"cinematic\". Jean later expanded that there was the fear of the potential film being considered \"not canonical\" with the TV series and the potential backlash of overcoming it by using a \"memory wipe\". In July 2017, Silverman and Jean said that the sequel was in the early stages of development and stressed the toll production of the first picture took on the entire staff. On August 10, 2018, it was reported that a sequel was in development. On July 22, 2019, Groening stated that he had \"no doubts\" that The Walt Disney Company, which acquired 21st Century Fox early that year, would likely produce a sequel one day. In July 2021, Jean stated that discussions for the potential sequel had stalled due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

Her debonair paramour, Count L\u00e9on d'Algout (Melvyn Douglas) offers to help retrieve the jewelry before it is sold.\nIn their hotel suite, Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski negotiate with Mercier (Edwin Maxwell) a prominent Parisian jeweler, when L\u00e9on interrupts the meeting. He explains that the jewels were seized illegally by the Soviet government and a petition has been filed preventing their sale or removal. Mercier withdraws his offer to purchase the jewelry until the lawsuit is settled.\nThe amiable, charming and cunning L\u00e9on treats the three Russians to an extravagant lunch, gets them drunk and easily wins their friendship and confidence. He sends a telegram to Moscow in their name suggesting a compromise.\nMoscow, angered by the telegram, then sends Nina Ivanovna \"Ninotchka\" Yakushova (Greta Garbo), a special envoy whose goal is to win the lawsuit, complete the jewelry sale and return with the three renegade Russians. Ninotchka is methodical, rigid and stern, chastising Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski for failing to complete their mission.\nNinotchka and L\u00e9on first meet each other on the street, their identities unknown to one another. He flirts, but she is uninterested. Intrigued, L\u00e9on follows her to the Eiffel Tower and shows her his home through a telescope. Ninotchka tells him he might be an interesting subject of study and suggests they go to his apartment. Leon, fascinated with Ninotchka, continues to flirt and she eventually begins to respond. They kiss, but are interrupted by a phone call from Buljanoff. Both then realize they are each other's adversaries over the jewelry and Ninotchka promptly leaves L\u00e9on's apartment, despite his protestations.\nL\u00e9on has fallen in love with Ninotchka; the next day, he follows her to a restaurant where she again rebuffs him; but after valiant attempts at making her laugh, L\u00e9on finally breaks down her resistance and she falls in love with him. \nWhile attending to the various legal matters over the lawsuit, Ninotchka gradually becomes seduced by the west. At a dinner date with L\u00e9on where she unexpectedly meets Swana face-to-face (her rival for the jewelry and for L\u00e9on's affections), Ninotchka consumes champagne for the first time and quickly becomes intoxicated. The following afternoon, a hungover Ninotchka is awakened by Swana and discovers Rakonin has stolen the jewelry during the night. Swana tells Ninotchka that she will return the jewels and drop the litigation if Ninotchka returns to Moscow immediately so that Swana can have L\u00e9on to herself. Ninotchka reluctantly agrees to Swana's proposal and after completing the sale of the jewelry to Mercier, she and Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski fly back to Moscow.\nLater that evening, L\u00e9on visits Swana and confesses his love for Ninotchka. Swana then informs L\u00e9on that Ninotchka has already left for Moscow. He attempts to follow her but is denied a Russian visa, because of his nobility.\nSometime later in Moscow, Ninotchka invites her three comrades to dinner at her communal apartment and they nostalgically recall their time in Paris. After dinner, Ninotchka finally receives a letter from L\u00e9on, but it has been completely censored by the authorities, and she is devastated.\nMore time passes; while in Constantinople to sell furs, Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski once again run afoul of their superiors. Against her wishes, Ninotchka is sent by Commissar Razinin (Bela Lugosi) to investigate and retrieve the trio.\nAfter Ninotchka arrives in Constantinople, Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski inform her that they have opened a restaurant and will not be returning to the Soviet Union. When Ninotchka asks them who is responsible for this idea, Buljanoff points to the balcony where L\u00e9on is standing. L\u00e9on explains that he was barred from entering Russia to win Ninotchka back, so he and the three Russians conspired to get her to leave the country. He asks her to stay with him and she happily agrees.\nThe final shot in the film is of Kopalski carrying a protest sign complaining that Iranoff and Buljanoff are unfair, because his name does not illuminate on the electric sign in front of their new restaurant."

While acting out the scene, Moomin spots Mymble struggling to swim ashore and dives into the ocean to save her from drowning. Spotting the shipwreck, the Moomins decide to go and salvage what they can, taking a mirror, books, a chest of tropical seeds and several crates of fireworks, but leaving the chest of gold. Little My (who stayed in the ship's crows nest) eventually follows the family home from the ship on the back of a shark. The pirates follow the family back to Moominhouse upon spotting them with their cargo, but leave after discovering their gold is still on the ship, which has begun to sink.\nAt night, Snorkmaiden suggests going to the Riviera after reading a magazine with her idol, Audrey Glamour. The Moomins, Snorkmaiden and Little My set sail, but get lost in a storm and wind up on a deserted island. A box floats ashore containing thousands of bugs uttering insults and bad language, which the group gathers into a bag to take with them. At night, Snorkmaiden notices the lights of the Riviera not too far away from their location, and the family arrive on the shores the next morning.\nWhile exploring the town, the family arrive at The Grand, the Riviera's resort hotel. Moominpappa introduces the family as \"DeMoomin of Moominvalley\", and are offered the Royal Suite to stay in. The family struggles to fit in among the affluent residents, however Moominpappa soon becomes friends with Marquis Mongaga, an artist who admires his bohemian eccentricity, and Snorkmaiden begins to spend her time with Audrey Glamour, and playboy Clark Tresco, much to Moomin's displeasure. Moomin and Moominmamma, both feeling that they don't fit into the rich lifestyle, decide to go and live under their boat on the beach.\nMongaga invites Moominpappa to his mansion where he shows him his art, consisting of walking elephant sculptures, and admits to him that he would gladly give up his rich lifestyle to live a bohemian lifestyle like Moominpappa. After pushing the statue of the town governor into the river and replacing it with one of the elephant statues, Mongaga comes to temporarily live with the Moomin family at the beach, where he carves more of his sculptures, and inspires Moomin to create a sculpture of his own. After sleeping rough and being attacked by a resident's dogs, Mongaga decides to depart back to his home, thanking the Moomins' for their hospitality and leaving his statues as a parting gift.\nMoomin, fed up with seeing Clark with Snorkmaiden, challenges him to a duel for Snorkmaiden's love the next morning.  While not adept with the sword, Moomin ultimately triumphs after bashing Clark on the head with the hilt. The directors of the hotel decide to evict the Moomin family as their eccentricity has made the reputation of the hotel suffer. Ordered to pay for their stay with a hefty bill, the family try to pay with Mongaga's elephant statues, which are deemed worthless because so many of them exist. Snork Maiden decides to use her stashed casino winnings in order to pay their bill. Her money greatly exceeds the amount of the bill, but she allows the hotel to keep the money. That evening, Snorkmaiden finds Moomin's statue, a sculpture of her as a mermaid, and the two embrace.\nMoominpappa decides to give homes to Mongaga's elephant statues, and Moominmamma opens her tropical rock garden to the public. Upon arriving at the town hall with a statue, the Mayor realises that Moominpappa was responsible for pushing the Governor's statue into the river and orders his arrest. After being chased through the town by the police, Moominpappa and the rest of the family quickly set sail. Moominmamma releases the bugs from the bag to halt the officers, which quickly swarm over the town with a plague of insults and bad language, causing fights among the residents.\nThe Moomin family get caught in a storm on their way back to Moominvalley, and decide to jettison some of their pots of tropical plants to lighten the load, inadvertently including Moomin's statue. Lost in the fog, with the plants still on board having overgrown into full trees, the family are eventually found and brought back to land by Snufkin. The family go back to their peaceful lives in Moominvalley, and Moomin and Snorkmaiden embrace on the cliffside while flying kites with Mymble and Little My."

        "content": "According to Sophia Jansson of the Moomin Characters, the company had been careful with giving the rights to new film adaptions about the Moomins for years. When the participation rights with the Telescreen expired, Sophia Jansson became interested in the idea of animated film based on the Moomin comic strip story. Producer Hanna Hemil\u00e4, who is Sophia's close friend, told Sophia about French animation director Xavier Picard, who was interested to adapt comic strips to the big screen. They contacted Picard and the film started production in France in 2010. The film is animated traditionally, hand drawn animation with a reduced color scale for the backgrounds in order to maintain continuity with the black-and-white comic strips. Pictak Cie worked on developing the visuals of the film. Chinese Sandman Animation Studio did 120,000 drawings for animation and Handle Productions produced the film. The film marks the feature film directorial debut of Xavier Picard. Picard was not aware of the Moomin characters before he discovered them 20 years ago in Japan, but he has been particularly fascinated by comic strips and has stated to want translate the art of Tove Jansson into animation. The Finnish voice cast of the film was confirmed in August 2014 featuring Maria Sid as Moominmamma, while the English voice cast was confirmed in a September 2014 press announcement. The film's score was composed by many Finnish and French composers, including Jean de Aguiar, Panu Aaltio, Timo Lassy, Milla Viljamaa and Anna-Karin Korhonen. The film stays faithful to Tove Jansson's original story in the original comic strip, with the addition of a few characters and story lines: Little My and Snufkin, have been added to the film, in addition to some other characters from the Moomin comic strip. While the production crew felt that the Riviera is fun and dramatic setting, they have also added a side story at the beginning of the film, that takes place in Moominvalley, and where Moomins got their idea for the sea voyage. The reason for this was to introduce the dwelling place of the Moomins for the international audience. Sophia Jansson herself approved the change."

        "content": "The Daily Show  (TDS) is an American late-night talk and satirical news television program. It airs each Monday through Thursday on Comedy Central with release shortly after on Paramount+ of extended episodes. The Daily Show draws its comedy and satire from recent news stories as well as political figures, media organizations, and often uses self-referential humor.The half-hour-long show premiered on July 22, 1996, and was first hosted by Craig Kilborn until December 17, 1998. Jon Stewart then took over as the host from January 11, 1999, until August 6, 2015, making the show more strongly focused on political satire and news satire, in contrast with the pop culture focus during Kilborn's tenure. Stewart was succeeded by Trevor Noah, whose tenure began on September 28, 2015. Under the different hosts, the show has been formally known as The Daily Show with Craig Kilborn from 1996 to 1998, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart from 1999 until 2015, and The Daily Show with Trevor Noah from 2015 to 2022. The Daily Show is the longest-running program on Comedy Central (counting all three tenures), and has won 25 Primetime Emmy Awards.The program has been popular among young audiences. The Pew Research Center suggested in 2010 that 74% of regular viewers were between 18 and 49, and that 10% of the audience watched the show for its news headlines, 2% for in-depth reporting, and 43% for entertainment; compared with respectively 64%, 10% and 4%, who said the same of CNN. In 2015 The Daily Show's median age of viewership is 36 years old. In 2023 the viewership for age range of 25-54 year olds is 158k and the age range for 18-34 year olds is 30k.Critics chastised Stewart for not conducting sufficiently hard-hitting interviews with his political guests, some of whom he may have lampooned in previous segments. Stewart and other Daily Show writers responded to such criticism by saying that they do not have any journalistic responsibility and that as comedians, their only duty is to provide entertainment. Stewart's appearance on the CNN show Crossfire picked up this debate, where he chastised the CNN production and hosts for not conducting informative and current interviews on a news network.In September 2022, Noah announced he would step down as the host of The Daily Show. His last episode as host was on December 8, 2022. As a new permanent host has not been chosen, the show has featured a rotating cast of guest hosts, with Jon Stewart returning to host Monday night shows starting February 12, 2024 and through the fall elections."

The show initially used New York PBS station WNET's facilities until late 1998, when it moved a few blocks to NEP Studio 54. The Colbert Report would claim NEP Studio 54 in 2005. On July 11, 2005, the show premiered in its new studio, NEP Studio 52, at 733 11th Avenue, a few blocks west of its former location.\nThe set of the new studio was given a sleeker, more formal look, including a backdrop of three large projection screens. The traditional guests' couch, which had been a part of the set since the show's premiere, was done away with in favor of simple upright chairs. The change was initially not well-received, spawning a backlash among some fans and prompting a \"Bring Back the Couch\" campaign. The campaign was mentioned on subsequent shows by Stewart and supported by Daily Show contributor Bob Wiltfong. The couch was eventually featured in a sweepstakes in which the winner received the couch, round-trip tickets to New York, tickets to the show, and a small sum of money.\nOn April 9, 2007, the show debuted a new set. The projection screens were revamped (with one large screen behind Stewart, while the smaller one behind the interview subject remained the same), a large, global map directly behind Stewart, a more open studio floor, and a J-shaped desk supported at one end by a globe. The intro was also updated; the graphics, display names, dates, and logos were all changed.\nOn September 28, 2015, the show debuted a new set alongside the debut of Trevor Noah's tenure. According to Larry Hartman, Noah took a lot of inspiration from Stewart's set. A second on-stage 'jumbo-tron' was added and the colours of the set were made lighter. The graphics, intro, theme music, lower thirds, logo, etc. were also all revamped. On July 19, 2016, the set and graphics were given another change to reflect Democalypse 2016 and denote The Daily Show's RNC and DNC coverage (which was taped in the conventions' respective cities). The new temporary sets had a Washington theme, and was meant to show that Washington is \"a little broke\" and needs \"repair\". Though the studio was reverted to its former self after the election week in 2016, the changes to the graphics were kept.\nAfter a stretch of episodes filmed from Trevor Noah's apartment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the show returned to a smaller studio at One Astor Plaza, the corporate headquarters of ViacomCBS in Times Square. The new studio had no audience, and a smaller, more intimate atmosphere with muted colors. In April 2022, The Daily Show returned to NEP Studio 52 with a revamped set, combining elements of the Times Square studio with a revamped version of its previous layout."

In 2006, The Onion editor-in-chief Scott Dikkers described it as a key launching pad for comedic talent, saying that \"I don't know if there's a better show you could put on your resume right now.\" Steve Carell, who was a correspondent between 1999 and 2005 before moving on to a movie career and starring television role in The Office, credits Stewart and The Daily Show with his success. In 2005, the show's longest-serving correspondent, Stephen Colbert, became the host of the spin-off The Colbert Report, earning critical and popular acclaim. Colbert would host the program until he was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of CBS's Late Show in 2015.

Munn appeared as a Daily Show correspondent in a total of 16 episodes, from June 2010 to September 2011.Wyatt Cenac had a tumultuous tenure on the show, revealing in a July 2015 interview on WTF with Marc Maron, that his departure stemmed in part from a heated argument he had with Jon Stewart in June 2011 over a bit about Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain. However, Cenac did return for Stewart's final episode to bid him farewell and the two exchanged an intentionally awkward conversation."

        "content": "The Daily Show airs on various networks worldwide; in addition, an edited version of the show called The Daily Show: Global Edition was produced each week specifically for overseas audiences until mid-2020. It has been airing outside of the U.S. on CNN International and other overseas networks since September 2002. This edition runs for a half-hour and contains a selection of segments, including one guest interview from the preceding week's shows, usually from the Monday or Tuesday episode. Noah provides an exclusive introductory monologue in front of an audience, usually about the week's prevalent international news story, and closing comments without an audience present. When aired on CNN International, the broadcast is prefaced by a written disclaimer: \"The show you are about to watch is a news parody. Its stories are not fact checked. Its reporters are not journalists. And its opinions are not fully thought through.\"Since February 27, 2017, The Daily Show with Trevor Noah has been regularly simulcast on Black Entertainment Television.\nBetween 2001 and 2006, Westwood One broadcast small, ninety-second portions of the show to various radio stations across America.In Canada, The Daily Show was aired on The Comedy Network (a cable channel similar to Comedy Central), in simulcast with the Comedy Central airing, as well as on the CTV broadcast network at 12:05 a.m. local time, following late local newscasts. After the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike, The Daily Show has not been shown on any TV channel in Canada.\nIn the United Kingdom and Ireland, the digital television channel More4 used to broadcast episodes of The Daily Show Tuesday through Friday evenings with the Global Edition, which is uncensored, airing on Mondays; regular episodes air the evening following their U.S. airing. More4 was the first international broadcaster to syndicate entire Daily Show episodes, though they made edits to the program due to content, language, length or commercial references. The program was also available to watch via the internet video on demand service 4oD. However, the 'toss' to The Colbert Report was usually included even though it was aired on FX, another channel. In addition, the placement of commercial breaks followed the UK format, with one break midway through the show rather than several short breaks at various points. When The Daily Show was on hiatus, either re-runs or alternative content were aired. Since January 2011, only the Global Edition is broadcast.\nIn July 2012 Comedy Central announced that The Daily Show would be shown on Comedy Central Extra in the same format as previously on More4, with episodes shown 24 hours after airing in the U.S. The show aired on the channel from July 2012 to April 2015.\nThe Global Edition of the week of July 20, 2011, was not aired in the UK as it included a segment mocking Rupert Murdoch's appearance before the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee in relation to the News International phone hacking scandal. Parliamentary rules ban parliamentary proceedings from being broadcast in a satirical context. Stewart dedicated a segment of the show on August 2, 2011, to lampooning the censorship of the episode in Britain. In May that year, The Daily Show mocked the ban on using footage of the Royal Wedding in a satirical context with an animated video that showed Paddington Bear, Gollum and Adolf Hitler as guests at the wedding, and depicted its attendants engaging in various forms of violent and sexual behavior. Stewart later discussed the ban with guest Keira Knightley.The Daily Show used to be aired in India on Comedy Central India.The Daily Show aired on Australian Pay TV channel, The Comedy Channel, weeknights at 6:30pm. Free-to-air digital channel ABC2 began broadcasting the show without commercial breaks in March 2010, but discontinued in January 2011 when The Comedy Channel obtained exclusive rights; episodes were also available on the network's online service ABC iView shortly after airing. The Comedy Channel (as well as ABC2 during 2010) used to air the show together with The Colbert Report, and both air the Global Edition on Mondays and the regular edition Tuesday through Friday. The Global Edition was previously shown weekend late nights on SBS before moving to Network TEN. The show now airs on 10 Shake (owned by Comedy Central parent ViacomCBS).\nIn North Africa and the Middle East, the Daily Show was broadcast on Showtime Arabia starting in 2008 and ending in 2015. When the show transitioned under Noah, OSN decided to wait a bit before airing the new show. Now, the Global Edition of Noah's show is broadcast on OSN's Comedy Central HD channel. Episodes are often edited if they contain topics deemed inappropriate for the region.\nEpisodes of the U.S. version are also available online the next day at Comedy Central's official Daily Show website, although this service is not available in all countries. However, clips for UK and Ireland viewers became available on the UK Comedy Central website in December 2011."

Since its debut, the series has received mixed reviews from television critics, but remained a relative success for the network, garnering a large fandom. The series finale was viewed by an estimated 1.41 million viewers. It had the second-highest rating of any cable TV series that aired that night but received a lukewarm reception from both critics and audiences.It is the first series in the Pretty Little Liars franchise, with the series having two spin-offs: Ravenswood and Pretty Little Liars: The Perfectionists, both of which were cancelled after one season.

The episode was directed by Paris Barclay and written by Steven Bochco, David Milch, Bill Clark and Nicholas Wootton. It was the culmination of months of public speculation on the method of closure that would be employed to write Jimmy Smits's critically acclaimed Bobby Simone character out of the regular cast and clear the way for Smits' replacement, Rick Schroder. \"Hearts and Souls\" was a critical and commercial success, achieving both high ratings and positive critical feedback and is now regarded as one of the greatest episodes in television history. It marked the second high-profile replacement of the partner for lead character Detective Andy Sipowicz, played by Dennis Franz.\nAt the 51st Primetime Emmy Awards, this episode won awards for Direction for Paris Barclay and Guest Actress for Debra Monk as well as a nominations in Writing for Steven Bochco, David Milch, Bill Clark and Nicholas Wootton. Barclay also won a Directors Guild of America Award. The episode also won an Eddie Award and a Banff Rockie Award as well as a Cinema Audio Society Award nomination.\nThis was Smits' last regular appearance as Simone, although he returned for one scene in an episode during the twelfth season.  The episode highlights his rapid and mysterious physical demise, which has culminated in his need for a heart transplant. Many emotional portrayals are included to represent the feelings of loved ones, friends and colleagues when someone that they care about is suddenly in dire medical need. In another storyline, the episode simultaneously highlights the stress that can be caused when alcoholism afflicts a family through a critically acclaimed guest appearance by Debra Monk as the ex-wife of Sipowicz."

        "content": "The episode begins with a special five-minute extended \"Previously on NYPD Blue\" segment that retraces Simone's (Jimmy Smits) whole character history. The final portion of the prologue  presents Lt. Arthur Fancy's (James McDaniel) prior episode persuasion of a police widow to directly donate her husband's heart to give Simone a chance to live.  The regular portion of the episode begins after the completed heart transplant. The episode focuses on whether Simone's heart transplant was successful.  It starts ten days after the heart transplant with his anticipated hospital release.  Simone's  recovery is hampered by an internal chest infection, which leaves him weakened.  The doctors attempt diagnosis of the infection and weakness, which appear to be minor, with tests. Tensions run high in the department from almost the beginning of the episode. Greg Medavoy (Gordon Clapp) has a scene where his verbal aggression with a citizen complainant provides a respite and represents the frustration and helplessness of Simone's friends and colleagues.  James Martinez' (Nicholas Turturro) generally good manners are also tested. Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) displays deep emotions to his wife ADA Sylvia Costas (Sharon Lawrence). The doctors differ in their opinions of which treatment to use. One advises Simone and wife Diane Russell (Kim Delaney) to pursue surgery, while another advises natural progression. Sipowicz's ex-wife Katie (Debra Monk) catches him offguard by appearing at the station drunk and asking for his help. She is preparing a pro se defense against DWI charges, but when Sipowicz is about to respond with assistance, she slips away. The personal turmoil drags him away from his compassionate watch. When he is distracted, Simone's health deteriorates to the point where his demise seems imminent. Dr. Carreras suggests ending the suffering, while Dr. Swan disagrees, but Carreras believes his sentiment is masking office politics that govern how statistics are attributed to various departments. Russell is conflicted on which doctor to take advice from. Sipowicz manages his ex-wife's crisis by negotiating agreed Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. After Simone receives his last rites, his colleagues say their goodbyes, while Simone dreams aloud of his mentor Patsy Ferrara. In Simone's waking dream, Patsy acts as a medium, helping Simone transition out of life. In the end, with his wife Russell, having removed his wedding ring, by his side, Simone, shedding a final tear, fades away, and the screen fades to white (as opposed to black)."

James' 1992 novel The Children of Men, was credited to five writers, with Clive Owen making uncredited contributions. The film is set in 2027, when two decades of human infertility have left society on the brink of collapse. Asylum seekers seek sanctuary in the United Kingdom, where they are subjected to detention and refoulement by the government. Owen plays civil servant Theo Faron, who tries to help refugee Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) escape the chaos. Children of Men also stars Julianne Moore, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Pam Ferris, Charlie Hunnam, and Michael Caine.\nThe film was released by Universal Pictures on 22 September 2006, in the UK and on 25 December in the US. Despite the limited release and lack of any clear marketing strategy during awards season by the film's distributor, Children of Men received critical acclaim and was recognised for its achievements in screenwriting, cinematography, art direction, and innovative single-shot action sequences. It was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Film Editing. It was also nominated for three BAFTA Awards, winning Best Cinematography and Best Production Design, and for three Saturn Awards, winning Best Science Fiction Film.

The United Kingdom is one of the few remaining nations with a functioning government and has become a police state in which immigrants are arrested and either imprisoned or executed.\nTheo Faron, a former activist turned cynical bureaucrat, is kidnapped by the Fishes, a militant immigrant-rights group led by Theo's estranged wife, Julian Taylor; the pair separated after their son's death during a 2008 flu pandemic. Julian offers Theo money to acquire transit papers for a young refugee woman named Kee. Theo obtains the documents from his cousin, a government minister, and agrees to escort Kee in exchange for a larger sum of money. Luke, a Fishes leader, drives Theo, Kee, Julian, and former midwife Miriam towards Canterbury, but an armed gang ambushes them and kills Julian. Two police officers later stop their car; Luke kills them, and the group hides Julian's body before heading to a safe house.\nKee reveals to Theo that she is pregnant, making her the only known pregnant woman in the world. Julian had intended to take her to the Human Project, a scientific research group in the Azores dedicated to curing humanity's infertility, which Theo believes does not exist. Luke becomes the new leader of the Fishes. That night, Theo eavesdrops on a discussion and learns that the Fishes orchestrated Julian's death so that Luke could become their leader and that they intend to kill him and use Kee's baby as a political tool. Theo wakes Kee and Miriam, and they escape to the secluded hideaway of Theo's reclusive, aging hippie friend Jasper Palmer, a former political cartoonist whose wife was tortured into catatonia by the British government for her activism.\nThe group plans to reach the Human Project ship, the Tomorrow, scheduled to arrive offshore at Bexhill, a notorious immigrant detention centre. Jasper plans to use Syd, an immigration officer to whom Jasper sells cannabis, to smuggle them into Bexhill as refugees, from where they can take a rowing boat to rendezvous with the Tomorrow. The next day, the Fishes discover Jasper's house, forcing the group to flee. Jasper stays behind to stall them and is murdered by Luke as Theo watches. Theo, Kee, and Miriam meet with Syd, who helps them board a bus to the camp. When Kee begins experiencing contractions, Miriam distracts a guard by feigning religious mania and is taken away.\nInside the camp, Theo and Kee meet a Gypsy woman, Marichka, who provides a room where Kee gives birth to a baby girl. The next day, Syd tells Theo and Kee that war has broken out between the British military and the refugees and that the Fishes have infiltrated the camp; he then reveals that Theo and Kee have a bounty on their heads and attempt to capture them. Theo subdues Syd with Marichka's help; they escape but are ambushed by the Fishes, who capture Kee and the baby. Theo tracks them to an apartment building that is under heavy fire. Theo confronts Luke, who is killed in an explosion, and Theo escorts Kee and the baby out. Awed by the baby, the British soldiers and Fishes temporarily stop fighting and allow the trio to leave. Marichka leads them to the boat but stays behind as they depart.\nAs British fighter jets conduct airstrikes on Bexhill, Theo and Kee row to the rendezvous point in heavy fog. Theo reveals that he was shot and wounded by Luke earlier; he teaches Kee how to burp her baby, and she tells him she will name the baby girl Dylan, after Theo's and Julian's lost son. Theo smiles weakly, then loses consciousness as the Tomorrow approaches. As the screen cuts to black, children's laughter is heard."

James novel was originally written by Paul Chart, and later rewritten by Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby. The studio brought director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n on board in 2001. Cuar\u00f3n and screenwriter Timothy J. Sexton began rewriting the script after the director completed Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n. Afraid he would \"start second guessing things\", Cuar\u00f3n chose not to read P. D. James' novel, opting to have Sexton read the book while Cuar\u00f3n himself read an abridged version. Cuar\u00f3n did not immediately begin production, instead directing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. During this period, David Arata rewrote the screenplay and delivered the draft which secured Clive Owen and sent the film into pre-production. The director's work experience in the United Kingdom exposed him to the \"social dynamics of the British psyche\", giving him insight into the depiction of \"British reality\". Cuar\u00f3n used the film The Battle of Algiers as a model for social reconstruction in preparation for production, presenting the film to Clive Owen as an example of his vision for Children of Men. In order to create a philosophical and social framework for the film, the director read literature by Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, as well as similar works. The 1927 film Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans was also influential."

Guest stars Alec Baldwin, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeffrey Tambor voice new characters, and David Hasselhoff appears in live-action as himself. In the film, Plankton enacts a plan to discredit his business nemesis Mr. Krabs, steal the Krabby Patty secret formula and take over the world by stealing King Neptune's crown and framing Mr. Krabs for the crime. SpongeBob and Patrick team up to retrieve the crown from Shell City to save Mr. Krabs from Neptune's wrath and their world from Plankton's rule.\nHillenburg accepted an offer for a film adaptation of SpongeBob SquarePants from Paramount Pictures in 2002, after having turned it down multiple times the previous year. He assembled a team from the show's writing staff, including himself, Derek Drymon, Tim Hill, Kent Osborne, Aaron Springer, and Paul Tibbitt, and they structured the film as a mythical hero's journey that would bring SpongeBob and Patrick to the surface. The film was originally intended to serve as the series finale, but Nickelodeon ordered more episodes of the series as it had become increasingly profitable, so Hillenburg resigned as showrunner, with Tibbitt taking his place.\nThe SpongeBob SquarePants Movie premiered in Los Angeles on November 14, 2004, and was released in the United States on November 19. It received generally positive reviews and grossed $141 million worldwide, becoming the seventh highest-grossing animated film of 2004.

His enthusiastic fry cook SpongeBob SquarePants hopes to be made manager, but Krabs instead chooses apathetic cashier Squidward Tentacles, explaining to SpongeBob that as a \"kid\" he is too immature to handle the job. Despondent, SpongeBob heads to the Goofy Goober ice cream parlor, where he and his best friend Patrick Star overindulge in ice cream. Meanwhile, Krabs' rival Plankton, owner of the unpopular Chum Bucket, steals King Neptune's crown, sends it to Shell City, and frames Krabs for the crime.\nKing Neptune confronts Krabs about his stolen crown at the Krusty Krab 2, becoming further convinced of his guilt when SpongeBob, feeling the effects of the previous night, smears him. Immediately regretful, SpongeBob offers to retrieve the crown from Shell City himself; Neptune freezes Krabs and orders SpongeBob to return within six days or Krabs will be executed. Neptune's daughter Mindy warns SpongeBob of a dangerous \"Cyclops\" that lurks near Shell City.\nSpongeBob and Patrick head for Shell City in the Patty Wagon, a Krabby Patty-shaped car stored underneath the restaurant. Immediately upon leaving Bikini Bottom, they are carjacked. They follow the thief to a dive bar, where they cause a scene by blowing bubbles in the bathroom, but manage to escape with the car.\nMeanwhile, Plankton steals the Krabby Patty formula from the frozen Krabs and uses it to sell Krabby Patties at The Chum Bucket, where he gives away free helmets that brainwash customers into doing Plankton's bidding. He subsequently takes over Bikini Bottom and renames it \"Planktopolis\".\nSpongeBob and Patrick come across a hazardous trench, lose the Patty Wagon again, and consider giving up. Mindy appears and gives them encouragement by applying fake mustaches made of seaweed, making them believe she magically transformed them from \"kids\" into men. With newfound confidence, the two successfully cross the trench.\nSpongeBob and Patrick run into Dennis, a hitman hired by Plankton, who pulls the mustaches off and prepares to crush the pair with his giant boot. He is himself stepped on by a bigger boot - which belongs to the \"Cyclops\" (actually a human diver). The Cyclops captures SpongeBob and Patrick and takes them to a gift shop where dried sea creatures are sold as souvenirs. They learn that the store is \"Shell City\" itself and find the crown, only to dry out from the intensity of the heat lamp. However, the tears they shed short-circuit the lamp, activating the emergency sprinkler system and reviving the duo alongside the dried sea creatures. While the sea creatures attack the Cyclops, SpongeBob and Patrick take the crown and head to the beach, where David Hasselhoff appears and offers them a ride. Dennis catches up to them and fights the pair on Hasselhoff's back, eventually getting knocked into the sea after SpongeBob blows bubbles into his eyes.\nBack at the Krusty Krab 2, Neptune arrives to execute Krabs, but SpongeBob and Patrick return with the crown just in time. Plankton drops a mind-control helmet on Neptune and surrounds SpongeBob, Patrick and Mindy with his army of slaves. SpongeBob, embracing the fact that he's accomplished so much despite being a kid, uses the power of rock and roll to play \"Goofy Goober Rock\", freeing Neptune and the citizens of Bikini Bottom from Plankton's control. Plankton is arrested and SpongeBob is made manager of the Krusty Krab 2.\nIn a post-credits scene, an usher informs the pirates that the film is over."

Narholz was signed when series music editor Nick Carr recommended him to Hillenburg after they worked together at the Associated Production Music library. Narholz was honored at the 2005 ASCAP Film and Television Music Awards for his work on the film, and received a nomination for Music in an Animated Feature Production at the 32nd Annie Awards.\nAmerican rock band The Flaming Lips recorded \"SpongeBob And Patrick Confront the Psychic Wall of Energy\". They shot the song's music video, directed by band member Wayne Coyne and filmmaker Bradley Beesley, in Austin, Texas. Coyne said, \"Stephen Hillenburg seems to be a fan of the weirder music of the late '80s and early '90s. He wanted to evoke the music he got turned onto back then.\" Coyne suggested a duet with Justin Timberlake, but Hillenburg refused, saying \"I don't want any of those sort of commercial weirdos on there. I don't like those commercial people. I like you guys, and Wilco and Ween.\" American band Wilco wrote and recorded \"Just a Kid\". One of the film's producers contacted frontman Jeff Tweedy after seeing a SpongeBob air freshener hanging from Tweedy's rearview mirror in I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco (2002). Tweedy said, \"I fell in love with SpongeBob when I heard him describe the darkness at the bottom of the sea as 'advanced darkness'. How could I not write a song for this film? It automatically makes me the coolest dad on the block.\" Avril Lavigne recorded the series' theme for the soundtrack. Other artists contributing to the soundtrack were Mot\u00f6rhead, singing \"You Better Swim\" (a derivative of their 1992 song \"You Better Run\"); Prince Paul (\"Prince Paul's Bubble Party\"); Ween (\"Ocean Man\"), and the Shins (\"They'll Soon Discover\", partially written in 2001).\"The Best Day Ever\", written by Tom Kenny (SpongeBob's voice actor) and Andy Paley, was featured in the film and on its soundtrack. Kenny and Paley were working on what would become the album The Best Day Ever, writing \"The Best Day Ever\" and \"Under My Rock\". The film's production team needed two more tracks for the soundtrack; Hillenburg heard the songs, and decided to include them. \"The Best Day Ever\" ended up being played during the film's closing credits."

        "content": "The Nightmare Before Christmas (also known as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas) is a 1993 American stop-motion animated musical fantasy film directed by Henry Selick in his feature directorial debut and produced and conceived by Tim Burton. It tells the story of Jack Skellington, the King of \"Halloween Town\", who stumbles upon \"Christmas Town\" and schemes to take over the holiday. Danny Elfman wrote the songs and score and provided the singing voice of Jack. The principal voice cast includes Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, William Hickey, Ken Page, Paul Reubens, Glenn Shadix, and Ed Ivory.\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas originated from a poem written by Burton in 1982 while he was working as an animator at Walt Disney Productions. With the critical success of Vincent that same year, Burton began to consider developing the film as either a short film or a half-hour television special, to no avail. Over the years, Burton's thoughts regularly returned to the project, and, in 1990, he made a development deal with Walt Disney Studios. Production started in July 1991 in San Francisco; Disney initially released the film through the Touchstone Pictures label  because the studio believed the film would be \"too dark and scary for kids\".The Nightmare Before Christmas premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 9, 1993, and was given a limited release on October 13, before its wide theatrical release on October 29. The film was met with commercial and critical success upon release, earning praise for its animation, particularly the innovation of stop-motion as an art form, as well as its characters, songs, and score. While initially a modest box office hit, it has since garnered a large cult following and is widely regarded as one of the greatest animated films of all time. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, a first for an animated film, but lost to Jurassic Park. The film has been reissued by Walt Disney Pictures and was re-released annually in Disney Digital 3-D from 2006 until 2010.\nIn 2023, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.\""

        "content": "Halloween Town is a fantasy world populated by various monsters and beings associated with the holiday (\"This is Halloween\"). Jack Skellington, the well-respected \"Pumpkin King,\" leads the town in organizing the annual Halloween celebrations. Unknown to the citizens, however, he has grown tired of the same annual routine this year and wants something new (\"Jack's Lament\"). Wandering in the woods the next morning, he discovers several trees containing doors, which lead to other holiday-themed worlds (Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving, Independence Day, Valentine's Day and St. Patrick's Day). Stumbling through the one leading to Christmas Town and awed by the unfamiliar holiday, Jack develops an obsession for it (\"What's This\").\nJack returns home to share his discovery with his friends and neighbors. They relate to Christmas Town's ruler, Santa Claus (whom Jack mistakenly calls \"Sandy Claws\"), but are unfamiliar with the concept of Christmas and conflate its customs with the Halloween traditions that they are used to (\"Town Meeting Song\"). Frustrated, Jack isolates himself in his house and studies Christmas further, intent upon finding a way to rationally explain it (\"Jack's Obsession\"). When days of study and experimentation accomplish nothing, however, Jack abandons his attempts to understand Christmas and decides to \"improve\" the holiday instead.\nJack announces that Halloween Town will take over Christmas this year and assigns Christmas-themed jobs, such as singing carols, making presents (\"Making Christmas\") and building a sleigh pulled by skeletal reindeer, to various residents. Sally, a feminine creation of local mad scientist Doctor Finkelstein, experiences a vision detailing that their efforts will end in disaster. Jack, whom she secretly loves, dismisses her warnings and instructs her to make a Santa Claus suit for him. He also tasks a mischievous trick-or-treating trio named Lock, Shock and Barrel with abducting Santa (\"Kidnap the Sandy Claws\"); however, he orders the youngsters not to involve his long-time rival Oogie Boogie, a bogeyman with a passion for gambling, in their plot.\nWhen Lock, Shock and Barrel bring Santa to Halloween Town (after mistakenly kidnapping the Easter Bunny first), Jack tells Santa that he will take care of Christmas this year and orders the trio to keep Santa safe. However, they disobey Jack's orders and bring Santa to Oogie, who plots to play a game with Santa's life at stake (\"Oogie Boogie's Song\"). Meanwhile, despite her best efforts, Sally is unable to stop Jack from proceeding with his plan (\"Sally's Song\"). As Jack departs to deliver presents in the real world, she attempts to rescue Santa from Oogie, only to be captured herself.\nUnknown to Jack at first, his presents terrify the real world's populace, who contact the authorities and are instructed by them to lock down their homes and residences for protection. When word spreads about Jack's actions, he is shot down by military forces, causing him to crash in a cemetery. While the residents of Halloween Town believe him to be dead, Jack actually survived the ordeal. Bemoaning the disaster that he has caused (\"Poor Jack\"), he realizes that he enjoyed the experience nonetheless, reigniting his love for Halloween, but must act fast to fix the mess he had caused.\nUpon returning home, Jack rescues Santa and Sally, then confronts Oogie and defeats him by unraveling a thread holding his cloth form together, causing all of the bugs inside Oogie to spill out and reduce him to nothing. Jack then apologizes to Santa, who scolds him for the chaos that he caused and for ignoring Sally's warnings. As Santa departs, however, both he and Sally assure Jack that Christmas can still be saved.\nSanta resumes his yearly duties as he replaces Jack's presents with genuine ones, while all of Halloween Town celebrates Jack's survival and return (\"Finale / Reprise\"). To assure Jack that there are no hard feelings between them, Santa brings a snowfall to the town, thereby bringing the Christmas spirit upon it and, in a way, fulfilling Jack's original dream. The citizens finally realize the true meaning of Christmas, while Jack and Sally declare their love for each other and share a kiss."

        "content": "Fight Club is a 1999 American film directed by David Fincher, and starring Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter. It is based on the 1996 novel by Chuck Palahniuk. Norton plays the unnamed narrator, who is discontented with his white-collar job. He forms a \"fight club\" with soap salesman Tyler Durden (Pitt), and becomes embroiled in a relationship with an impoverished but beguilingly attractive woman, Marla Singer (Bonham Carter).\nPalahniuk's novel was optioned by Fox 2000 Pictures producer Laura Ziskin, who hired Jim Uhls to write the film adaptation. Fincher was selected because of his enthusiasm for the story. He developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice from the cast and others in the film industry. It was filmed in and around Los Angeles from July to December 1998. He and the cast compared the film to Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and The Graduate (1967), with a theme of conflict between Generation X and the value system of advertising.Studio executives did not like the film, and they restructured Fincher's intended marketing campaign to try to reduce anticipated losses. Fight Club premiered at the 56th Venice International Film Festival on September 10, 1999, and was released in the United States on\nOctober 15, 1999 by 20th Century Fox. The film failed to meet the studio's expectations at the box office and received polarized reactions from critics. It was ranked as one of the most controversial and talked-about films of the 1990s. However, Fight Club later found commercial success with its home video release, establishing it as a cult classic and causing media to revisit the film.

        "content": "Fincher said Fight Club was a coming of age film, like the 1967 film The Graduate but for people in their 30s. Fincher described the narrator as an \"everyman\"; the character is identified in the script as \"Jack\", but left unnamed in the film. Fincher outlined the Narrator's background, \"He's tried to do everything he was taught to do, tried to fit into the world by becoming the thing he isn't.\" He cannot find happiness, so he travels on a path to enlightenment in which he must \"kill\" his parents, god, and teacher. By the start of the film, he has \"killed off\" his parents. With Tyler Durden, he kills his god by doing things they are not supposed to do. To complete the process of maturing, the Narrator has to kill his teacher, Tyler Durden.The character is a 1990s inverse of the Graduate archetype: \"a guy who does not have a world of possibilities in front of him, he has no possibilities, he literally cannot imagine a way to change his life.\" He is confused and angry, so he responds to his environment by creating Tyler Durden, a Nietzschean \u00dcbermensch, in his mind. While Tyler is who the Narrator wants to be, he is not empathetic and does not help the Narrator face decisions in his life \"that are complicated and have moral and ethical implications\". Fincher explained, \"[Tyler] can deal with the concepts of our lives in an idealistic fashion, but it doesn't have anything to do with the compromises of real life as modern man knows it. Which is: you're not really necessary to a lot of what's going on. It's built, it just needs to run now.\" While studio executives worried that Fight Club was going to be \"sinister and seditious\", Fincher sought to make it \"funny and seditious\" by including humor to temper the sinister element.Screenwriter Jim Uhls described the film as a romantic comedy, explaining, \"It has to do with the characters' attitudes toward a healthy relationship, which is a lot of behavior which seems unhealthy and harsh to each other, but in fact does work for them\u2014because both characters are out on the edge psychologically.\" The Narrator seeks intimacy, but avoids it with Marla Singer, seeing too much of himself in her. While Marla is a seductive and negativist prospect for the Narrator, he embraces the novelty and excitement that comes with befriending Tyler. The Narrator is comfortable being personally connected to Tyler, but becomes jealous when Tyler becomes sexually involved with Marla. When the Narrator argues with Tyler about their friendship, Tyler tells him that being friends is secondary to pursuing the philosophy they have been exploring. When Tyler implies that Marla is a risk they should remove, the Narrator realizes he should have focused on her and begins to diverge from Tyler's path.\n\nThe Narrator, an unreliable narrator, is not immediately aware that he is mentally projecting Tyler. He also mistakenly promotes the fight clubs as a way to feel powerful, though the Narrator's physical condition worsens while Tyler Durden's appearance improves. While Tyler desires \"real experiences\" of actual fights like the Narrator at first, he manifests a nihilistic attitude of rejecting and destroying institutions and value systems. His impulsive nature, representing the id, is seductive and liberating to the Narrator and the members of Project Mayhem. Tyler's initiatives and methods become dehumanizing; he orders around the members of Project Mayhem with a megaphone similar to camp directors at Chinese re-education camps. The Narrator pulls back from Tyler and arrives at a middle ground between his conflicting selves.Fight Club examines Generation X angst as \"the middle children of history\". Norton said it examines the value conflicts of Generation X as the first generation raised on television: this generation had \"its value system largely dictated to it by advertising culture\", and was told one could achieve \"spiritual happiness through home furnishing\". His character walks through his apartment while visual effects identify his many IKEA possessions. Fincher described the Narrator's immersion, \"It was just the idea of living in this fraudulent idea of happiness.\" Pitt said, \"Fight Club is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it, so for the first time we can experience the pain.\"Fight Club also parallels the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause; both probe the frustrations of the people in the system.  The characters, having undergone societal emasculation, are reduced to \"a generation of spectators\". A culture of advertising defines society's \"external signifiers of happiness\", causing an unnecessary chase for material goods that replaces the more essential pursuit of spiritual happiness. The film references consumer products such as Gucci, Calvin Klein, and the Volkswagen New Beetle. Norton said of the Beetle, \"We smash it ... because it seemed like the classic example of a Baby Boomer generation marketing plan that sold culture back to us.\" Pitt explained the dissonance, \"I think there's a self-defense mechanism that keeps my generation from having any real honest connection or commitment with our true feelings. We're rooting for ball teams, but we're not getting in there to play. We're so concerned with failure and success\u2014like these two things are all that's going to sum you up at the end.\"The violence of the fight clubs serves not to promote or glorify combat, but for participants to experience feeling in a society where they are otherwise numb. The fights represent a resistance to the impulse to be \"cocooned\" in society. Norton believed the fighting strips away the \"fear of pain\" and \"the reliance on material signifiers of their self-worth\", leaving them to experience something valuable. When the fights evolve into revolutionary violence, the film only half-accepts the revolutionary dialectic by Tyler Durden; the Narrator pulls back and rejects Durden's ideas. Fight Club purposely shapes an ambiguous message whose interpretation is left to the audience. Fincher said, \"I love this idea that you can have fascism without offering any direction or solution. Isn't the point of fascism to say, 'This is the way we should be going'? But this movie couldn't be further from offering any kind of solution.\""

        "content": "Cineaste's Gary Crowdus summarized the critical reception at the time, \"Many critics praised Fight Club, hailing it as one of the most exciting, original, and thought-provoking films of the year.\" He wrote of the negative opinion, \"While Fight Club had numerous critical champions, the film's critical attackers were far more vocal, a negative chorus which became hysterical about what they felt to be the excessively graphic scenes of fisticuffs ... They felt such scenes served only as a mindless glamorization of brutality, a morally irresponsible portrayal, which they feared might encourage impressionable young male viewers to set up their own real-life fight clubs in order to beat each other senseless.\" When Fight Club premiered at the 56th Venice International Film Festival, the film was fiercely debated by critics. A newspaper reported, \"Many loved and hated it in equal measures.\" Some critics expressed concern that the film would incite copycat behavior, such as that seen after A Clockwork Orange debuted in Britain nearly three decades previously. Upon the film's theatrical release, The Times reported the reaction, \"It touched a nerve in the male psyche that was debated in newspapers across the world.\" Although the film's makers called Fight Club \"an accurate portrayal of men in the 1990s,\" some critics called it \"irresponsible and appalling.\" Writing for The Australian, Christopher Goodwin stated, \"Fight Club is shaping up to be the most contentious mainstream Hollywood meditation on violence since Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange.\"Janet Maslin, reviewing for The New York Times, praised Fincher's direction and editing of the film. She wrote that Fight Club carried a message of \"contemporary manhood\", and that, if not watched closely, the film could be misconstrued as an endorsement of violence and nihilism. Roger Ebert, reviewing for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave Fight Club two stars out of four, calling it \"visceral and hard-edged\", but also \"a thrill ride masquerading as philosophy\", whose promising first act is followed by a second that panders to macho sensibilities and a third he dismissed as \"trickery\". Ebert later acknowledged that the film was \"beloved by most, not by me\". He was later requested to have a shot-by-shot analysis of Fight Club at the Conference on World Affairs; he stated that \"[s]eeing it over the course of a week, I admired its skill even more, and its thought even less.\" Jay Carr of The Boston Globe opined that the film began with an \"invigoratingly nervy and imaginative buzz\", but that it eventually became \"explosively silly\". Newsweek's David Ansen described Fight Club as \"an outrageous mixture of brilliant technique, puerile philosophizing, trenchant satire and sensory overload\" and thought that the ending was too pretentious. Richard Schickel of Time described the mise en sc\u00e8ne as dark and damp: \"It enforces the contrast between the sterilities of his characters' aboveground life and their underground one. Water, even when it's polluted, is the source of life; blood, even when it's carelessly spilled, is the symbol of life being fully lived. To put his point simply: it's better to be wet than dry.\" Schickel applauded the performances of Pitt and Norton, but criticized the \"conventionally gimmicky\" unfolding and the failure to make Bonham Carter's character interesting.The film review website Metacritic surveyed 36 critics and assessed 24 reviews as positive, 10 as mixed, and 2 as negative. It gave an aggregate score of 67 out of 100, which it said indicated \"generally favorable reviews\". The similar website Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 185 critics and, categorizing the reviews as positive or negative, assessed 148 as positive and 37 as negative. Of the 185 reviews, it determined an average rating of 7.4 out of 10. It gave the film a score of 80% and summarized the critical consensus, \"Solid acting, amazing direction, and elaborate production design make Fight Club a wild ride.\""

        "content": "Fight Club was one of the most controversial and talked-about films of the 1990s. The film was perceived as the forerunner of a new mood in American political life. Like other 1999 films Magnolia, Being John Malkovich, and Three Kings, Fight Club was recognized as an innovator in cinematic form and style, since it exploited new developments in filmmaking technology. After Fight Club's theatrical release, it became more popular via word of mouth, and the positive reception of the DVD established it as a cult film that David Ansen of Newsweek conjectured would enjoy \"perennial\" fame. The film's success also heightened Palahniuk's profile to global renown.Following Fight Club's release, several fight clubs were reported to have started in the United States. A \"Gentleman's Fight Club\" was started in Menlo Park, California, in 2000 and had members mostly from the tech industry. Teens and preteens in Texas, New Jersey, Washington state, and Alaska also initiated fight clubs and posted videos of their fights online, leading authorities to break up the clubs. In 2006, an unwilling participant from a local high school was injured at a fight club in Arlington, Texas, and the DVD sales of the fight led to the arrest of six teenagers. An unsanctioned fight club was also started at Princeton University, where matches were held on campus. The film was suspected of influencing Luke Helder, a college student who planted pipe bombs in mailboxes in 2002. Helder's goal was to create a smiley pattern on the map of the United States, similar to the scene in Fight Club in which a building is vandalized to have a smiley on its exterior. On July 16, 2009, a 17-year-old who had formed his own fight club in Manhattan was charged with detonating a homemade bomb outside a Starbucks Coffee shop in the Upper East Side. The New York City Police Department reported the suspect was trying to emulate \"Project Mayhem\".Fight Club had a significant impact on evangelical Christianity, in the areas of Christian discipleship and masculinity. A number of churches called their cell groups \"fight clubs\" with a stated purpose of meeting regularly to \"beat up the flesh and believe the gospel of grace\". Some churches, especially Mars Hill Church in Seattle, whose pastor Mark Driscoll was obsessed with the film, picked up the film's emphasis on masculinity, and rejection of self-care. Jessica Johnson suggests that Driscoll even called on \"his brothers-in-arms to foment a movement not unlike Project Mayhem.\"A Fight Club video game was released by Vivendi Universal Games in 2004 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and for mobile phones. The game was a critical and commercial failure, and was panned by such publications and websites as GameSpot, Game Informer, and IGN. The video game Jet Set Radio, initially released in 2000 for Sega's Dreamcast console, was inspired by the film's anti-establishment themes.In 2003, Fight Club was listed as one of the \"50 Best Guy Movies of All Time\" by Men's Journal. In 2004 and 2006, Fight Club was voted by Empire readers as the eighth and tenth greatest film of all time, respectively. Total Film ranked Fight Club as \"The Greatest Film of our Lifetime\" in 2007 during the magazine's tenth anniversary. In 2007, Premiere selected Tyler Durden's line, \"The first rule of fight club is you do not talk about fight club,\" as the 27th greatest movie line of all time. In 2008, readers of Empire ranked Tyler Durden eighth on a list of the 100 Greatest Movie Characters. Empire also identified Fight Club as the 10th greatest movie of all time in its 2008 issue The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.In 2010, two viral mash-up videos featuring Fight Club were released. Ferris Club was a mash-up of Fight Club and the 1986 film Ferris Bueller's Day Off. It portrayed Ferris as Tyler Durden and Cameron as the narrator, \"claiming to see the real psychological truth behind the John Hughes classic\". The second video, Jane Austen's Fight Club, also gained popularity online as a mash-up of Fight Club's fighting rules and the characters created by 19th-century novelist Jane Austen."

        "content": "In the distant future, the gargantuan blue humanoid Traags have brought human beings (who are called Oms) from Earth to the planet Ygam, where the Traags maintain a technologically and spiritually advanced society. The Traags consider Oms animals, and while they keep some as pets, others live in the wilderness and are periodically slaughtered by the Traags to control their population. Traags have much longer lifespans than Oms, but reproduce much less.\nWhen an Om mother is tortured to death by three Traag children, her orphaned infant is found by Master Sinh, a key Traag leader, and his daughter Tiwa, who keeps the boy as a pet and names him Terr. Tiwa loves Terr and is careful not to hurt him, but, in accordance with her parents' instructions, gives him a collar with which she can pull him in any direction. She brings Terr to sessions in which she receives her education using a headset that transmits knowledge into her mind; a defect in Terr's collar allows him to receive the knowledge too. Around the time that Tiwa grows into her teens and first performs Traag meditation, which allows the species to travel with their minds, she loses some interest in Terr, who has become a young man and acquired much Traag knowledge. He escapes into the wilderness, stealing Tiwa's headset.\nThere he runs into a wild female Om, who cuts off his collar and introduces him to her tribe, which lives in an abandoned Traag park full of strange creatures and landscapes. Terr shows them how to use the headset to acquire Traag knowledge and literacy, winning the right to do so in a duel. The literacy they gain allows them to read a Traag announcement that the park will be purged of Oms, and, when the purge comes, some are slaughtered by Traag technology while others escape, joining forces with another tribe. They are attacked by two Traag passers-by and manage to kill one of them before escaping to an abandoned Traag rocket depot, much to the outrage of Traag leaders.\nThey live there for years, joined by many other Oms. Due to the knowledge acquired from Terr's headset, they manage to replicate Traag technology, including two rockets; they hope to leave Ygam for its moon, the Fantastic Planet, and live there safe from Traags. When a large-scale Traag purge hits the depot and many Oms are slaughtered, a group led by Terr uses the rockets to flee to the Fantastic Planet, where they discover large statues that Traags travel to during meditation and use to meet beings from other galaxies in a strange mating ritual that maintains their species. The Oms destroy some of the statues, threatening the Traags' existence; the genocide of Oms is halted on Ygam, and, facing a crisis, the Traags negotiate for peace. The Oms agree to leave the Fantastic Planet to the Traags for their meditations, and in return, an artificial satellite is put into orbit around Ygam and given to the Oms as a new home. This leads to an era of peaceful coexistence between the two species, who now benefit from each other's way of thinking."

The music is very '70s-clich\u00e9d and will appeal to fans of French and Italian '70s soundtrack stylings.

Set in Modesto, California, in 1962, the film is a study of the cruising and early rock 'n' roll cultures popular among Lucas's age group at that time. Through a series of vignettes, it tells the story of a group of teenagers and their adventures over the course of a night.\nWhile Lucas was working on his first film, THX 1138, Coppola asked him to write a coming-of-age film. The genesis of American Graffiti took place in Modesto in the early 1960s, during Lucas's teenage years. He was unsuccessful in pitching the concept to financiers and distributors, but found favor at Universal Pictures after every other major film studio turned him down. Filming began in San Rafael, California, but the production crew was denied permission to shoot beyond a second day. As a result, production was moved to Petaluma. The film is the first movie to be produced by George Lucas's Lucasfilm.\nAmerican Graffiti premiered on August 2, 1973, at the Locarno International Film Festival in Switzerland, and was released on August 11, 1973, in the United States. The film received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Produced on a $777,000 budget (equivalent to approximately $5,332,993 in 2023 dollars), it has become one of the most profitable films ever. Since its initial release, American Graffiti has earned an estimated return well over $200 million in box-office gross and home video sales, not including merchandising. In 1995, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry."

Steve and Curt are to travel \"Back East\" in the morning and start college but the latter has second thoughts about leaving. Laurie, Steve's girlfriend and Curt's sister, arrives moments later, Steve suggesting to her that they see other people while he is away at college to \"strengthen\" their relationship. Though not openly upset, it affects her interactions with him through the night.\nCurt, Steve and Laurie attend the high-school sock hop. En route, Curt sees a beautiful blonde woman driving a white Ford Thunderbird next to them, who mouths \"I love you\" before turning a right. The interaction causes Curt to desperately search for her throughout the night. After leaving the hop, he is coerced into joining a group of greasers called \"The Pharaohs\", who force him into several tasks including stealing coins from arcade machines and hooking a chain to a police car, ripping out its back axle. During a tense ride, the Pharaoh leader tells Curt that \"The Blonde\" is a prostitute, which he does not believe.\nWith Steve allowing Terry to take care of his car while he's studying at college, Terry cruises around the strip and picks up rebellious Debbie. Now calling himself \"Terry The Tiger\", he attempts all night to impress her by lying about the car being his and purchasing alcohol with no ID. While he and Debbie leave Steve's car in a rural spot in order to share a romantic interlude, thieves steal the car. Later, after the alcohol has made Terry violently sick, he sees Steve's car and attempts to steal it back. The car thieves appear and beat him up until John intervenes. Terry eventually admits to Debbie that he's been lying about the car all along and he actually drives a scooter; she suggests it is \"almost a motorcycle\" and says she had fun with him, agreeing to meet up with him again.\nIn an attempt to get cruising company for the evening, John inadvertently picks up Carol, a precocious 12-year-old who manipulates him into driving her around all night. Lying to suspicious friends that she's a cousin and he's stuck with babysitting duty, they have a series of petty arguments until another car's occupants verbally harass her as she attempts to walk home alone, John then deciding to protect her. Meanwhile, skilled racer Bob Falfa is searching out John to challenge him to the defining race for John's drag-racing crown. During his night of goading anyone he comes across for a challenge, he picks up an emotional Laurie after the argument with Steve that was brewing all night.\nAfter leaving the Pharaohs, Curt drives to the radio station to ask omnipotent disc jockey \"Wolfman Jack\" to read a message out on air for the blonde in the White Thunderbird. He encounters an employee who tells him the Wolfman does not work there and that the shows are pre-taped for replay, claiming the Wolfman \"is everywhere\" but promises to have the Wolfman air the request. As Curt leaves, he notices the employee talking into the microphone and realizes he is in fact the Wolfman, who reads the message for the blonde asking her to call Curt on the pay phone at Mel's Drive-In.\nAfter taking Carol home, John is found by Bob Falfa, successfully goading him into the definitive race along Paradise Road outside the city, with some spectators appearing to watch. As Terry starts the drag race, John takes the lead but Bob's tire blows out, swerving into a ditch and rolling over before bursting into flames. Steve, aware that Laurie was Bob's passenger, rushes to the wreck as she and Bob crawl out and stagger away before the car explodes. While John helps his rival to safety, Laurie begs Steve not to leave her, he assures her that he will stay with her in Modesto.\nExhausted, Curt is awakened by the pay phone. He finally speaks to the blonde, who does not reveal her identity but hints at the possibility of meeting that night. Curt replies that he is leaving town. Later at the airfield, he says goodbye to his parents and friends before boarding the plane. After takeoff, he looks down at the ground from the window and sees the white Thunderbird driving along the road below. Curt thoughtfully gazes into the sky.\nPostscript: In 1964, John was killed by a drunk driver; in 1965, Terry was reported missing in action near An L\u1ed9c, South Viet Nam. Steve is an insurance agent in Modesto and Curt is a writer living in Canada."

George Lucas had to be realistic about the complexities of copyright clearances, though, and suggested a number of alternative tracks. Universal wanted Lucas and producer Gary Kurtz to hire an orchestra for sound-alikes. The studio eventually proposed a flat deal that offered every music publisher the same amount of money. This was acceptable to most of the companies representing Lucas's first choices, but not to RCA\u2014with the consequence that Elvis Presley is conspicuously absent from the soundtrack. Clearing the music licensing rights had cost approximately $90,000, and as a result, no money was left for a traditional film score. \"I used the absence of music, and sound effects, to create the drama,\" Lucas later explained.A soundtrack album for the film, 41 Original Hits from the Soundtrack of American Graffiti, was issued by MCA Records. The album contains all the songs used in the film (with the exception of \"Gee\" by the Crows, which was subsequently included on a second soundtrack album), presented in the order in which they appeared in the film."

Producer Coppola sided with Lucas against Tanen and Universal, offering to \"buy the film\" from the studio and reimburse it for the $775,000 (equivalent to $5.6 million in 2023) it had cost to make it. 20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures made similar offers to the studio. Universal refused these offers and told Lucas they planned to have William Hornbeck re-edit the film.When Coppola's The Godfather won the Academy Award for Best Picture in March 1973, Universal relented and agreed to cut only three scenes (amounting to a few minutes) from Lucas's cut. These include an encounter between Toad and a fast-talking car salesman, an argument between Steve and his former teacher Mr. Kroot at the sock hop, and an effort by Bob Falfa to serenade Laurie with \"Some Enchanted Evening\". The studio initially thought that the film was only fit for release as a television movie.Various studio employees who had seen the film began talking it up, and its reputation grew through word of mouth. The studio dropped the TV movie idea and began arranging for a limited release in selected theaters in Los Angeles and New York. Universal presidents Sidney Sheinberg and Lew Wasserman heard about the praise the film had been garnering in LA and New York, and the marketing department amped up its promotion strategy for it, investing an additional $500,000 (equivalent to $3.4 million in 2023) in marketing and promotion. The film was released in the United States on August 11, 1973 to sleeper hit reception. The film had cost only $1.27 million (equivalent to $9.3 million in 2023) to produce and market, but yielded worldwide box office gross revenues of more than $55 million (equivalent to $377 million in 2023). It had only modest success outside the United States and Canada, but became a cult film in France.Universal reissued Graffiti on May 26, 1978, with Dolby sound and earned an additional $63 million (equivalent to $294 million in 2023), which brought the total revenue for the two releases to $118 million (equivalent to $551 million in 2023). The reissue included stereophonic sound and a couple of minutes the studio had removed from Lucas's original cut. All home video releases also included these scenes. Also, the date of John Milner's death was changed from June 1964 to December 1964 to fit the narrative structure of the upcoming sequel, More American Graffiti. At the end of its theatrical run, American Graffiti had one of the greatest profit-to-cost ratios of a motion picture ever.Producer Francis Ford Coppola regretted having not financed the film himself. Lucas recalled, \"He would have made $30 million (equivalent to $206 million in 2023) on the deal. He never got over it and he still kicks himself.\" It was the 13th-highest-grossing film of all time in 1977 and, adjusted for inflation, is currently the 43rd highest. By the 1990s, American Graffiti had earned more than $200 million (equivalent to $466 million in 2023) in box-office gross and home video sales. In December 1997, Variety reported that the film had earned an additional $55.13 million in rental revenue (equivalent to $105 million in 2023).Universal Studios first released the film on DVD in September 1998, and once more as a double feature with More American Graffiti (1979) in January 2004. The 1978 version of the film was used, with an additional digital change to the sky in the opening title sequence. Universal released the film on Blu-ray with a new digitally remastered picture supervised by George Lucas on May 31, 2011. In celebration of its 50th anniversary, a 4K restoration of the film updated with a brand new 5.1 sound mix was re-released domestically on on August 27 and 30 before a Ultra HD Blu-ray release on November 7, 2023."

The consensus reads: \"One of the most influential of all teen films, American Graffiti is a funny, nostalgic, and bittersweet look at a group of recent high school grads' last days of innocence.\" Metacritic calculated a score of 97 out of 100, indicating \u201cuniversal acclaim\u201d. Roger Ebert gave the film a full four stars and praised it for being \"not only a great movie, but a brilliant work of historical fiction; no sociological treatise could duplicate the movie's success in remembering exactly how it was to be alive at that cultural instant\". Gene Siskel awarded three-and-a-half stars out of four, writing that although the film suffered from an \"overkill\" of nostalgia, particularly with regards to a soundtrack so overstuffed that it amounted to \"one of those golden-oldie TV blurbs,\" it was still \"well-made, does achieve moments of genuine emotion, and does provide a sock (hop) full of memories.\"Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, \"American Graffiti is such a funny, accurate movie, so controlled and efficient in its narrative, that it stands to be overpraised to the point where seeing it will be an anticlimax.\" A.D. Murphy from Variety felt American Graffiti was a vivid \"recall of teenage attitudes and morals, told with outstanding empathy and compassion through an exceptionally talented cast of unknown actors\". Charles Champlin of The New York Times called it a \"masterfully executed and profoundly affecting movie.\" Jay Cocks of Time magazine wrote that American Graffiti \"reveals a new and welcome depth of feeling. Few films have shown quite so well the eagerness, the sadness, the ambitions and small defeats of a generation of young Americans.\" Pauline Kael of The New Yorker was less enthused, writing that the film \"fails to be anything more than a warm, nice, draggy comedy, because there's nothing to back up the style. The images aren't as visually striking as they would be if only there were a mind behind them; the movie has no resonance except from the jukebox sound and the eerie, nocturnal jukebox look.\" She also noted with disdain that the epilogue did not bother to mention the fates of any of the women characters. Dave Kehr, writing in the Chicago Reader, called the film a brilliant work of popular art that redefined nostalgia as a marketable commodity, while establishing a new narrative style."

        "content": "Internet reviewer MaryAnn Johanson acknowledged that American Graffiti rekindled public and entertainment interest in the 1950s and early 1960s, and influenced other films such as The Lords of Flatbush (1974) and Cooley High (1975) and the TV series Happy Days. Alongside other films from the New Hollywood era, American Graffiti is often cited for helping give birth to the summer blockbuster. The film's box-office success made George Lucas an instant millionaire. He gave an amount of the film's profits to Haskell Wexler for his visual consulting help during filming, and to Wolfman Jack for \"inspiration\". Lucas's net worth was now $4 million, and he set aside a $300,000 independent fund for his long-cherished space opera project, which would eventually become the basis for Star Wars (1977).The financial success of Graffiti also gave Lucas opportunities to establish more elaborate development for Lucasfilm, Skywalker Sound, and Industrial Light & Magic. Based on the success of the 1978 reissue, Universal began production for the sequel More American Graffiti (1979). Lucas and writers Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz later collaborated on Howard the Duck (1986) and Radioland Murders (1994). They were both released by Universal Pictures, for which Lucas acted as executive producer. Radioland Murders features characters intended to be Curt and Laurie Henderson's parents, Roger and Penny Henderson. In 1995, American Graffiti was deemed culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. In 1997 the city of Modesto, California, honored Lucas with a statue dedication of American Graffiti at George Lucas Plaza.Director David Fincher credited American Graffiti as a visual influence for Fight Club (1999). Lucas's Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones (2002) features references to the film. The yellow airspeeder that Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi use to pursue bounty hunter Zam Wesell is based on John Milner's yellow deuce coupe, while Dex's Diner is reminiscent of Mel's Drive-In. Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman conducted the \"rear axle\" experiment on the January 11, 2004, episode of MythBusters.Given the popularity of the film's cars with customizers and hot rodders in the years since its release, their fate immediately after the film is surprising. All were offered for sale in San Francisco newspaper ads; only the '58 Impala (driven by Ron Howard) attracted a buyer, selling for only a few hundred dollars. The yellow Deuce and the white T-bird went unsold, despite being priced as low as $3,000. The registration plate on Milner's yellow deuce coupe is THX 138 on a yellow, California license plate, slightly altered, reflecting Lucas's earlier science-fiction film (THX 1138)."

        "content": "Toy Story is a 1995 American animated comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. The first installment in the franchise of the same name, it was the first entirely computer-animated feature film, as well as the first feature film from Pixar. It was directed by John Lasseter (in his feature directorial debut) and produced by Bonnie Arnold and Ralph Guggenheim, from a screenplay written by Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen, and Alec Sokolow and a story by Lasseter, Stanton, Pete Docter, and Joe Ranft. The film features music by Randy Newman, and was executive-produced by Steve Jobs and Edwin Catmull. The film features the voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Annie Potts, R. Lee Ermey, John Morris, Laurie Metcalf, and Erik von Detten.\nTaking place in a world where toys come to life when humans are not present, the plot of Toy Story focuses on the relationship between an old-fashioned pullstring cowboy doll named Woody and a modern space cadet action figure, Buzz Lightyear, as Woody develops jealousy towards Buzz when he becomes their owner Andy's favorite toy.\nFollowing the success of Tin Toy, a short film that was released in 1988, Pixar was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature film that was told from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote early story treatments, which were rejected by Disney, who wanted the film's tone to be \"edgier\". After several disastrous story reels, production was halted and the script was rewritten to better reflect the tone and theme Pixar desired: \"toys deeply want children to play with them, and ... this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions\". The studio, then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced Toy Story under minor financial constraints.\nToy Story premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on November 19, 1995, and was released in theaters in North America on November 22 of that year. It was the highest-grossing film during its opening weekend, eventually grossing over $373 million worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of 1995. The film received critical acclaim and holds a 100% approval rating on film aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes. It was praised for the technical innovation of the 3D animation, script, Newman's score, appeal to all age groups, and voice performances (particularly Hanks and Allen); it is frequently lauded as one of the best animated films ever made and, due to its status as the first computer-animated film, one of the most important films in medium's history and film at large. The film received three Academy Award nominations\u2014Best Original Screenplay (the first animated film to be nominated for the award), Best Original Song for \"You've Got a Friend in Me\", and Best Original Score\u2014in addition to being honored with a non-competitive Special Achievement Academy Award.In 2005, Toy Story was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\", one of nine films designated in its first year of eligibility. The success of Toy Story launched a multimedia franchise. It spawned three sequels beginning with Toy Story 2 (1999), a spin-off film Lightyear (2022), numerous short films, and a planned fourth sequel. The film also had a theatrical 3D re-release in 2009 as part of a double feature with the second film."

Sheriff Woody, Andy's favorite toy and their de facto leader, sends Sarge and his green army men to spy on Andy's birthday party with a baby monitor, as the toys are nervous about him receiving new toys that could replace them. The other toys include Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, Rex the tyrannosaur, Hamm the piggy bank, and Bo Peep the porcelain doll. Andy receives a Buzz Lightyear action figure who believes he is an actual Space Ranger and does not know he is a toy. Buzz impresses the others with his high-tech features and becomes Andy's new favorite toy, making Woody jealous.\nTwo days before the move, Andy's family plans for a dinner at Pizza Planet. To ensure Andy brings him along and not Buzz, Woody tries using the radio-controlled car RC to knock Buzz behind the desk, but accidentally knocks him out the bedroom window instead. The other toys (except for Bo and Slinky) believe Woody deliberately tried to kill Buzz. Andy takes Woody and a furious Buzz confronts him in the car. The two fight, fall out of the car, and are left behind.\nAfter a further quarrel, they hitch a ride to the restaurant on a Pizza Planet delivery truck. Buzz mistakenly believes a claw crane full of Little Green Men to be a true rocket. Andy's sadistic next-door neighbor Sid, who destroys toys for fun, captures the two from the crane and takes them to his house, where they encounter his Bull Terrier Scud and his abused \"mutant\" toys made from parts of other toys he has destroyed.\nBuzz is shocked by a TV commercial that reveals he is indeed a toy. He attempts to fly but falls, breaks his arm, and has a mental breakdown. After Sid's toys fix Buzz, Sid tapes Buzz to a rocket, planning to blow him up the next morning. Overnight, Woody helps Buzz realize that his purpose is to make Andy happy, restoring Buzz's resolve. Sid takes Buzz out to blow him up while Woody rallies the mutant toys to terrify Sid into never harming toys again.\nNow freed, Buzz and Woody pursue Andy's moving truck, but Scud gives chase. Woody climbs into the truck and pushes RC out to rescue Buzz. The other toys, still thinking Woody has killed Buzz, toss him back out. Buzz and Woody pursue the truck on RC, and the other toys see them and realize their error. RC's batteries run out, forcing Woody to ignite the rocket strapped to Buzz. Buzz opens his wings to sever the tape just before the rocket explodes; he and Woody fall through the sunroof of Andy's car, landing safely inside.\nAt the Christmas gift-opening in the new house, Mr. Potato Head is delighted when Molly gets a Mrs. Potato Head. Woody and Buzz jokingly ponder what gift could be \"worse\" than Buzz, only to nervously smile at each other when Andy gets a dachshund puppy."

It aired on Nine Network (series 1) and ABC Television (series 2 and 3) in Australia, and on TV2 in New Zealand.\nSet on the fictional Craggy Island, a remote location off Ireland's west coast, Father Ted stars Dermot Morgan as Father Ted Crilly, alongside fellow priests Father Dougal McGuire (Ardal O'Hanlon) and Father Jack Hackett (Frank Kelly). Dishonourably exiled on the island by Bishop Leonard Brennan (Jim Norton) for various reasons, the priests live together in the parochial house with their housekeeper Mrs Doyle (Pauline McLynn). The show subverts parodies of low-brow humour as it portrays nuanced themes of loneliness, agnosticism, existentialism and purgatory experienced by its title character; this deeper meaning of the show has been much acclaimed.Father Ted won several British Academy Television Awards\u2014including twice for Best Comedy Series, and remains a popular sitcom in Ireland and the UK. In a 2001 Channel 4 poll, Dougal was ranked fifth on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters.

Her polished manners and superior attitude make her no friends among the rest of the aspiring actresses living there, particularly her new roommate, flippant, cynical dancer Jean Maitland (Ginger Rogers). From Terry's expensive clothing and her photograph of her elderly grandfather, Jean assumes she has obtained the former from her sugar daddy, just as fellow resident Linda Shaw (Gail Patrick) has from her relationship with influential theatrical producer Anthony Powell (Adolphe Menjou). In truth, Terry comes from a wealthy Midwest family. Over the strong objections of her father, Henry Sims (Samuel S. Hinds), she is determined to try to fulfill her dreams. In the boarding house, Terry's only supporter is aging actress Anne Luther (Constance Collier), who appoints herself Terry's mentor and acting coach.\nWhen Powell sees Jean dancing, he decides to dump Linda. He arranges for Jean and her partner Annie (Ann Miller) to get hired for the floor show of a nightclub he partly owns. He then starts dating Jean, who starts falling for him.\nMeanwhile, well-liked Kay Hamilton (Andrea Leeds) had great success and rave reviews in a play the year before but has had no work since and is running out of money. She clings desperately to the hope of landing the leading role in Powell's new play, Enchanted April. She finally gets an appointment to see Powell, only to have him cancel. She faints in the reception area, the result of malnutrition and disappointment. Seeing this, Terry barges into Powell's private office and berates him for his callousness.  As a result, the other boarding house residents start to warm up to the newcomer.\nTerry's father secretly finances Enchanted April on the condition that Terry is given the starring role, hoping she will fail and return home. Powell invites Terry to his penthouse to break the news. When Jean shows up unannounced, Terry sees the opportunity to save her friend from the philandering Powell. She pretends that Powell is trying to seduce her. It works. However, it makes things uncomfortable around the boarding house. Terry's landing on the plum part breaks Kay's heart.\nThe inexperienced Terry is so woodenly bad during rehearsals that Powell tries to get out of his contract with Sims. On opening night, after she learns from Jean that Kay has committed suicide, Terry decides she cannot go on. Anne Luther tells her that she must, not just for herself and the tradition of the theatre, but also for Kay. She does and gives a heartfelt performance. She and the play are a hit, much to the chagrin of her father, who is in the audience. At her curtain call, Terry gives a speech in tribute to her dead friend, and Terry and Jean are reconciled. The play remains a success after months, but Terry continues to board at the Footlights Club. A newcomer shows up looking for a room."

The dialogue is brilliant, with typical American point and brevity, but nearly always spiteful and cruel, for these girls are the product of a hard environment. Three stand out from among the rest: Miss Katharine Hepburn (...) Miss Ginger Rogers (...) Miss Andrea Leeds.\nHepburn's four movies preceding Stage Door had been commercial failures. However, as a result of the positive response to this performance, RKO immediately cast her opposite Cary Grant in the screwball comedy Bringing Up Baby (1938).\nStage Door made a small profit of $81,000."

        "content": "Corpse Bride (also known as Tim Burton's Corpse Bride) is a 2005 stop-motion animated musical fantasy film directed by Mike Johnson and Tim Burton from a screenplay by John August, Caroline Thompson, and Pamela Pettler, based on characters created by Burton and Carlos Grangel. The plot is set in a fictional Victorian era village in England. Johnny Depp leads the cast as the voice of Victor, while Helena Bonham Carter voices Emily, the title bride. An international co-production between the United States and United Kingdom and produced by Tim Burton Productions and Laika Entertainment, Corpse Bride is the third stop-motion feature film produced by Burton and the first directed by him (just after the previous two films, 1993's The Nightmare Before Christmas and 1996's James and the Giant Peach, were directed by Henry Selick). The film was the first stop-motion film from Burton that was distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures.\nCorpse Bride is based on a 17th-century Jewish folktale, which Joe Ranft introduced to Burton while they were finishing The Nightmare Before Christmas. Work on the film started in November 2003 when Burton was completing Big Fish (2003). He continued with production on his next live-action feature, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which was produced simultaneously with the film. Production of the stop-motion animation feature took place at 3 Mills Studios in East London. It was shot with Canon EOS-1D Mark II digital SLRs, rather than the 35 mm film cameras used for Burton's previous stop-motion film The Nightmare Before Christmas. Burton immediately brought regular collaborators Depp and Danny Elfman aboard. The film was dedicated to executive producer Joe Ranft, who died during production.\nCorpse Bride premiered at the 62nd Venice International Film Festival on September 7, 2005, and was released in theaters on September 23, 2005, in the United States and on October 13, 2005, in the United Kingdom. It became a critical and commercial success, grossing $118.1 million worldwide against its $40 million budget and received critical praise for its animation, characters, songs, and humor. The film won the National Board of Review for Best Animated Feature, and was nominated for the 78th Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature. The film won the Annie Awards Ub Iwerks Award for Technical Achievement in 2006, where it was also nominated for Best Animated Feature, Best Character Design, and Best Direction."

Although the two are initially nervous, they become smitten and fall in love instantly when they meet; however, the nervous Victor ruins their wedding rehearsal by forgetting his vows, dropping the ring, and accidentally setting Lady Everglot's dress on fire. Fleeing to a nearby forest, he successfully rehearses his vows with a tree and places his wedding ring on an upturned root. However, the root is revealed to be the skeletal finger of a dead girl named Emily gowned in a wedding dress, who rises from the grave, proclaims herself as Victor's new wife, and spirits him away to the Land of the Dead, a realm far more colorful and whimsical.\nDuring his time with Emily, Victor learns that she was murdered years earlier on the night of her elopement by her fianc\u00e9, who stole the family jewels and gold she had brought (\"Remains of the Day\"). Emily reunites Victor with his long-dead dog, Scraps, and they bond. However, desperate to return to Victoria, Victor tricks Emily into returning them to the Land of the Living by claiming he wants her to meet his parents. Emily brings Victor to see Elder Gutknecht, the kindly ruler of the underworld, who grants them temporary passage. Victor reunites with Victoria and confesses his wish to marry her as soon as possible. Before the pair can share a kiss, Emily discovers them and, feeling betrayed and hurt, drags Victor back to the Land of the Dead (\"Tears to Shed\"). Emily confronts Victor and claims Victoria to be the other woman, but Victor says she is the other woman and he didn\u2019t want to marry her. Victoria tries to tell her parents of Victor's situation, but nobody believes her and they assume he has left her and she is going insane. Against her will, Victoria's parents decide to marry her to Lord Barkis Bittern, a presumed-wealthy visitor who appeared at the wedding rehearsal.\nAfter reconciling with Emily, Victor learns of Victoria's impending marriage to Barkis from his family's newly deceased coachman Mayhew. Upset over this news, Victor decides to marry Emily properly, learning that this will require him to repeat his wedding vows with her in the Land of the Living and drink the Wine of Ages, a poison, in order to join Emily in death. The dead swiftly prepare for the ceremony and head \"upstairs\" (\"The Wedding Song\"), where the town erupts into a temporary panic upon their arrival until the living recognize their departed loved ones and joyously reunite with them. The chaos causes a panicked Barkis to expose his own poor financial standing and his intentions to marry Victoria only for her supposed wealth, leading her to reject him.\nVictoria witnesses Victor and Emily's wedding as Victor completes his vows and prepares to drink the poison, only for Emily to stop him when she realizes she is denying Victoria her chance to live happily with him. Just as Emily reunites Victor and Victoria, Barkis arrives to kidnap Victoria; Emily recognizes Barkis as both her previous fianc\u00e9 and murderer. Victor duels with Barkis to protect Victoria, and Emily intervenes to save Victor's life. Accepting defeat, Barkis mockingly toasts Emily for dying unwed and unwittingly drinks the poison, causing him to die and allowing the dead \u2013 who cannot interfere in the affairs of the living \u2013 to take retribution against him for his crimes. Emily, now freed from her torment, releases Victor of his vow to marry her and returns his ring, allowing him to marry Victoria. As she steps into the moonlight, she transforms into a swarm of butterflies that fly into the sky as Victor and Victoria watch and embrace."

Despite his success, he is tired of the everlasting conflict in Israel; he dreams of leaving his military career behind to become a hairstylist for John Paul Mitchell Systems in the United States. When he reveals this ambition to his parents, they dismiss and mock him.\nHe is tasked with capturing his long-time arch-rival: Fatoush \"Phantom\" Hakbarah, a Palestinian militant who also possesses superhuman traits. After engaging Phantom in a fight, Zohan fakes his own death and subsequently smuggles himself to New York City. Phantom's supposed success in killing Zohan garners him much fame across the Arab world, leading him to open the \"Phantom Muchentuchen\" restaurant chain.\nAfter arriving, Zohan immediately seeks out a job at the local Paul Mitchell salon, but is turned down due to his lack of experience. Later, Zohan witnesses a traffic collision involving two motorists and a cyclist named Michael. One of the motorists starts bullying Michael and yells anti-Arab slurs at Zohan, who promptly beats him up. Michael subsequently befriends Zohan and takes him in at his apartment, where he lives with his mother Gail. \nZohan encounters a fellow Israeli immigrant, Oori, who runs a shady electronics shop. He recognizes Zohan and vows to keep his true identity a secret before bringing him to an area in Lower Manhattan that is predominantly populated by other Middle Eastern immigrants, including Israeli Americans and Palestinian Americans. At Oori's suggestion, Zohan attempts to secure a job at the struggling salon of a Palestinian woman named Dalia. Due in part to his lack of experience, she only allows Zohan to sweep the salon's floors and he will not receive any pay because her salon is facing financial difficulties. \nWhen a stylist unexpectedly quits, one of the customers asks Zohan to cut her hair, and he accepts. Zohan's reputation rapidly spreads, causing Dalia's business to prosper. Dalia makes her rent payments in full, upsetting a corporate businessman, Grant Walbridge, who has been trying to buy out all the local tenants to build a mall .\nZohan is identified by a Palestinian-American taxi driver, Salim, who recognizes him. He bears a grudge against Zohan due to a past incident, and meets with his friends Hamdi and Nasi, convincing them to help him kill Zohan. After unsuccessfully attempting to get in touch with Hezbollah, Salim contacts Phantom in Amman, Jordan. He threatens to publicly disclose the truth about Zohan being alive, but Phantom makes a deal with him and prepares to come find Zohan himself.\nMeanwhile, Zohan has fallen in love with Dalia, but she rejects Zohan because of his service with the Israeli military. Zohan decides to quit working at her salon, hoping to keep her safe from any inter-ethnic strife. He later confronts Phantom in a championship Hacky Sack game sponsored by Walbridge. However, the confrontation is cut short when he learned that the Middle Eastern neighborhood is being attacked by unknown assailants.\nAs their businesses burn, Zohan calms the Israelis and the Palestinians, as both sides are blaming each other for the violence. When Phantom appears, he confronts Zohan, who refuses to fight after having been deeply inspired by Dalia's pacifism. Dalia then discloses that she is Phantom's sister, and convinces her brother to cooperate with Zohan against the arsonists, who are revealed to be a group of white supremacists on Walbridge's payroll. \nThe Phantom works with Zohan to save the block. The racist arsonists are defeated and Walbridge is arrested by the police; however, the overexcited Phantom accidentally destroys all  the remaining shops with his superhuman screams.\nWith the Israelis and Palestinians now working together, the block is rebuilt and transformed into a collectively-owned mall. Zohan and Dalia, having now married, open a beauty salon together. Zohan's parents visit from Israel and approve of his new job and lifestyle."

Apatow left the project after the first draft in 2000 to work on his show Undeclared and had, for the most part, not been involved in the project since. The film is based in part on the story of Nezi Arbib, an Israeli soldier who after his service moved to southern California and opened a hair salon. Sandler trained with Arbib and his brothers, also former soldiers, for two weeks to learn hairstyling and work with clients.The movie features elements that first appeared in the SNL sketches \"Sabra Shopping Network\" and \"Sabra Price Is Right\", which starred Tom Hanks and were written by Robert Smigel. They originated lines such as 'Sony guts' and 'Disco, Disco, good, good'. The first sketch is also notable for featuring one of Adam Sandler's first uncredited television appearances while the second featured Sandler, Schneider, Smigel and Kevin Nealon in supporting parts. Robert Smigel worked with Sandler on past films including Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Little Nicky, but this was the first time in which he was credited for helping to write the script. He was an executive producer on the film which allowed him to further contribute to the movie's comedic sensibility.The Israeli newspaper Haaretz commented that the movie was known in Hollywood circles as \"the Israeli movie\". Haaretz noted that while \"Israeli actors were rushing to audition [for the movie],\" the response among Arab actors was far from enthusiastic. Emmanuelle Chriqui, who played Zohan's Palestinian love interest, was raised as an Orthodox Jew. The film poked fun at the popularity of hummus in Israeli culture. In the movie, characters used it to brush their teeth and as a method to douse the flames of a fire, as well as a hair care product."

The harshness of the narrative \"transcends the trivial genre of bourgeois male corrupted by bohemian female\" and the complexity of Sternberg's character development rejects \"the old stereotype of the seductress\" who ruthlessly cuckolds her men.Sarris outlines Sternberg's \"complex interplay\" between Lola and the professor:\n\n\"The Blue Angel achieved its most electrifying effects through careful grading and construction. When Dietrich sings \"Falling in Love Again\" for the first time, the delivery is playful, flirtatious, and self-consciously seductive. The final rendition is harsher, colder, and remorseless. The difference in delivery is not related to the old sterotype of the seductress finally showing her true colors, but rather to a psychological development in Dietrich's Lola from mere sensual passivity to a more forceful fatalism about the nature of her desires. Lola's first instinct is to accept the Professor's paternal protection and her last is to affirm her natural instincts, not as coquettish expedients but as the very terms by which she expresses her existence. Thus, as the Professor has been defeated by Lola's beauty, Lola has been ennobled by the Professor's jealousy...\"\nBiographer John Baxter echoes this the key thematic sequence that reveals \"the tragic dignity\" of Rath's downfall:\n\n \"[T]he tragedy of Immanuel Rath was not that he lost his head over a woman, but that he could not reconcile the loss of power with the acquisition of freedom.\" When Rath is forced to relinquish \"his authority [over] his students, he sinks into alienated apathy\u2026Rath's failure to grasp the chance opened to him\u2026is portrayed in terms of his increasing silence, as he sinks more and more sullenly into the guise of the ridiculous, ironically named clown\u2026In the end, the authoritarian master of language is bereft of articulate speech\", finally erupting into a \"paraoxysmic cockscrow\" when he discovers that he has been cuckolded by Lola.\nWhen Rath, in a jealous rage, enters the room where Lola is making love to the cabaret strongman Mazeppa, Sternberg declines to show Rath, now a madman, at the moment when he is violently subdued by the authorities and placed in a straitjacket. Sternberg rewards the degraded Professor Rath for having \"achieved a moment of masculine beauty [by] crowing like a maddened rooster\" at Lola's deception: \"Sternberg will not cheapen that moment by degrading a man who has been defeated.\" Sternberg presents \"the spectacle of a prudent, prudish man blocked off from all means of displaying his manhood except the most animalistic.\" The loss of Lola leaves Rath with but one alternative: death."

Seaman, based on a story conceived by Jim and John Thomas. Loosely adapted from The Wild Wild West, a 1960s television series created by Michael Garrison, it is the only production since the television film More Wild Wild West (1980) to feature the characters from the original series.\nThe film stars Will Smith (who previously collaborated with Sonnenfeld on Men in Black two years earlier in 1997) and Kevin Kline as two U.S. Secret Service agents who work together to protect U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant (Kline in a dual role) and the United States from all manner of dangerous threats during the American Old West. The film features a supporting cast consisting of Kenneth Branagh, Salma Hayek, Ted Levine, and M. Emmet Walsh, as well as an orchestral film score by Western film score veteran Elmer Bernstein and extensive visual effects courtesy of Industrial Light & Magic.\nReleased theatrically in the United States on June 30, 1999 by Warner Bros. and produced on a $170 million budget (making it one of the most expensive films ever made when adjusting for inflation at the time of its release), Wild Wild West was a commercial failure, grossing only $113.8 million domestically and $108.3 million overseas for a worldwide total of $222.1 million. Receiving largely negative reviews from critics, the film was nominated for eight Razzies and won five at the 20th Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture and Worst Original Song (for the song \"Wild Wild West\" by Smith)."

U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant informs them about the disappearances of America's key scientists and a treasonous plot by McGrath, giving them the task of finding the scientists.\nAboard their train The Wanderer, West and Gordon examine the severed head of scientist Thaddeus Morton, finding a clue that leads them to Dr. Arliss Loveless, a legless ex-Confederate officer and engineering genius. Infiltrating Loveless' plantation during a party, the duo rescues a woman named Rita Escobar, who asks for their help in rescuing her father Guillermo Escobar, who is one of the kidnapped scientists.\nLoveless holds a demonstration of his newest weapon, a steam-powered prototype tank, and uses McGrath's soldiers for target practice. Accusing McGrath of \"betrayal\" for surrendering at Appomattox Court House, Loveless shoots and leaves him for dead. Gordon, West and Rita find McGrath, who reveals he was framed by Loveless for the massacre before dying. Upon catching up with Loveless on The Wanderer, a panicked Rita accidentally releases sleeping gas during a brief fight, knocking out West, Gordon and herself.\nWest and Gordon wake up as Loveless pulls away in The Wanderer, taking Rita hostage. Announcing his intention to capture Grant at the golden spike ceremony, he leaves the duo in a deadly trap in a cornfield. After narrowly escaping, West and Gordon stumble across Loveless' private railroad, leading to his secret industrial complex at Spider Canyon. There, they witness Loveless' ultimate weapon, a giant mechanical spider armed with nitroglycerin cannons that he uses to capture Grant and Gordon at the ceremony, while West gets shot and left for dead by one of Loveless' henchwomen upon being caught sneaking in the spider.\nAt his complex, Loveless announces his plan to dissolve the United States, dividing the territory among Great Britain, France, Spain, Mexico, the Native American people and Loveless himself. When Grant refuses to surrender, Loveless orders Gordon to be executed, but West,  having survived, disguises himself as a belly dancer and distracts Loveless, allowing Gordon to free the captives.\nLoveless escapes on his spider, taking Grant with him. As Loveless once again demands that Grant surrender, he refuses and Loveless responds by destroying a small town. Using a flying machine, Gordon and West catch up to the spider, where West battles Loveless' henchmen before confronting Loveless himself, now on mechanical legs. After freeing Grant, Gordon shoots one of Loveless' legs, allowing West to gain the upper hand. As the mechanical spider approaches a cliff, Loveless shoots at West with the concealed gun he used to kill McGrath, but instead hits the spider's machinery, halting it abruptly at the canyon's edge. Both West and Loveless fall from the spider, but West survives by catching a chain dangling from the machinery.\nGrant promotes Gordon and West as the first agents of his new United States Secret Service. As Grant departs on The Wanderer, West and Gordon reunite with Rita and attempt to court her, only for Rita to reveal that Professor Escobar is actually her husband. Gordon and West ride into the sunset on the spider."

Ralston helped create the original television series The Wild Wild West and scripted the pilot episode \"The Night of the Inferno\". In a deposition, Ralston explained that in 1964, he had been approached by producer Michael Garrison, who \"said he had an idea for a series, good commercial idea, and wanted to know if I could glue the idea of a Western hero and a James Bond type together in the same show\". Ralston said he then created the Civil War characters, the format, the story outline and nine drafts of the script that were the basis for the television series. It was his idea, for example, to have a secret agent named Jim West who would perform secret missions for a bumbling President Grant.\nRalston's experience brought to light a common Hollywood practice of the 1950s and 1960s when television writers who helped create popular series allowed producers or studios to take credit for a show, thus cheating the writers out of millions of dollars in royalties. However, Ralston died in 1999 before his suit was settled, resulting in Warner Bros. paying his family between $600,000 and $1.5 million."

The ensemble cast includes Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn, Brad Dexter, James Coburn, and Horst Buchholz as a group of seven gunfighters and Eli Wallach as their main antagonist. The seven title characters are hired to protect a small village in Mexico from a group of marauding bandits led by Wallach.The film was released by United Artists on October 12, 1960. It was both a critical and commercial success and has been appraised as one of the greatest films of the Western genre. It spawned three sequels, a television series that aired from 1998 to 2000, and a 2016 film remake. Elmer Bernstein's film score was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score and is listed on the American Film Institute's list of the top 25 American film scores.

After the latest raid, during which Calvera kills a villager, the village leaders decide to fight back. They send three villagers carrying their few objects of value to try and barter for weapons.\nIn a town just inside the United States, the villagers find Chris, a veteran Cajun gunslinger, and approach him. Chris advises that they instead hire gunfighters to defend the village, as \"men are cheaper than guns.\" At first agreeing only to help them recruit, Chris eventually leads the group. \nDespite the meager pay, Chris finds five willing gunmen. They include Vin Tanner, a gunfighter gone broke from gambling; Chris' friend Harry Luck, who assumes Chris is hiding a much bigger reward for the work; the Irish Mexican Bernardo O'Reilly, who has fallen on hard times; Britt, an expert in both knife and gun who joins purely for the challenge involved; and the dapper, on-the-run gunman Lee, plagued by nightmares of fallen enemies and so haunted that he has lost his nerve for battle. On their way to the village, they are trailed by the hotheaded Chico, an aspiring gunfighter whose previous attempts to join Chris had been spurned. Impressed by his persistence, Chris allows him into the group.\nArriving at the village, they work with the villagers to build fortifications and train them in combat. They note the lack of women in the village until Chico stumbles upon Petra and discovers the women were hidden in fear that the gunmen would rape them. The gunmen begin to bond with the villagers, and Petra pursues Chico. When Bernardo points out that the gunmen are being given the choice food, they share it with the village children.\nThree of Calvera's men are dispatched to reconnoiter the village; due to a mistake by Chico, the seven are forced to kill all three. Some days later Calvera and his bandits arrive in force. The seven and the villagers kill eleven gang members and run the rest out of town. The villagers celebrate, believing Calvera will not return. However, Chico infiltrates Calvera's camp and learns that Calvera will return, as they are short on food. Some villagers fear reprisals and call for the gunfighters to leave. Even some of the seven waver, but Chris insists that they stay. \nThe seven ride out for a pre-emptive raid on Calvera's camp but find it abandoned. Returning to the village, they are captured by Calvera and his men, who have colluded with some of the villagers to sneak in and take control. Calvera spares the seven's lives, part believing they have been disillusioned by the betrayal, and part fearing reprisals from their friends across the border. \nPreparing to depart, Chris and Vin admit they have become emotionally attached to the village. Bernardo likewise gets angry when the boys he befriended call their parents cowards. Chico declares that he hates the villagers; when Chris points out he grew up as a farmer as well, Chico angrily responds that it is men like Calvera and Chris who made the villagers what they are.\nThe gang escorts the seven gunmen from the village and returns their weapons. The seven debate their next move. All agree to return and fight, except Harry, who believes the effort is futile and suicidal.\nThe gunmen infiltrate the village and a gunfight breaks out. Harry, who has had a change of heart, returns in time to save Chris's life but is himself fatally shot. Harry pleads to know what they were fighting for, and Chris lies about hidden gold to let Harry believe he died for a fortune; Harry smiles before dying. Lee finds the nerve to burst into a house where several villagers are being held, shooting their captors and releasing the prisoners to join the fight, but is gunned down as he leaves the house. Bernardo, shot protecting the boys he befriended, tells them as he dies to see how bravely their fathers fought. Britt dies after killing many bandits and exposing himself from cover. Chris shoots Calvera, who demands to know why he came back for the village. The remaining bandits flee.\nAfter Chico decides to stay with Petra, Chris and Vin bid farewell to the village elder. The elder tells them that only the villagers have won, whereas the gunslingers are \"like the wind, blowing over the land and passing on.\" As they pass the graves of their fallen comrades, Chris admits the elder was right."

The previous year he had created the character of Professor Bernard Quatermass for the science-fiction serial The Quatermass Experiment. The adaptation was produced and directed by the equally respected Rudolph Cartier, perhaps the BBC's best producer-director of the 1950s who was always adventurous artistically and technically. Cartier, a veteran of the UFA film studios in 1930s Germany who had fled the Nazi regime for Britain in 1936, had worked with Kneale the previous year on The Quatermass Experiment and was a veteran of many television drama productions.It was his work on Quatermass that had prompted the BBC's Head of Drama, Michael Barry, to ask Cartier to work on an adaptation of the novel, having shown his abilities with literary sources in a version of Wuthering Heights, again with Kneale handling the scripting. The BBC had purchased the rights to a television version of Nineteen Eighty-Four soon after its publication in 1949, with Kenneth Tynan having apparently originally been keen on adapting the work. The first version of the script, produced in late 1953, was written by Hugh Faulks, in consultation with Orwell's widow Sonia Brownell, but when Cartier joined in January 1954 he demanded that Kneale be allowed to handle the adaptation. This and other complexities of production meant that the April airdate \u2013 which would have been about 30 years before the novel was set \u2013 had to be postponed."

Cushing went on to become a film star, as would his co-star Donald Pleasence, who played Syme. Pleasence was the only member of the cast present in the 1956 feature film adaptation of the story, playing an amalgamation of Syme and Parsons with the latter's name.Other cast members included Yvonne Mitchell, who had starred in the Kneale/Cartier Wuthering Heights, as Julia, and Andr\u00e9 Morell as O'Brien. Wilfrid Brambell, later known for his roles in Steptoe and Son and as Paul McCartney's grandfather in A Hard Day's Night, appeared in two roles, as the old man Winston speaks with in the pub and as a prisoner later on when Winston is incarcerated. Nigel Kneale who had briefly acted in the 1940s before turning to scriptwriting, had a small voice-over role as an announcer. The face of Big Brother was Roy Oxley, a member of the BBC design department whose inclusion was something of an in-joke on the part of the production team.The composer of the incidental music for the programme was John Hotchkis, who insisted on a larger than usual orchestra to perform the piece."

        "content": "Until the early 1960s, the vast majority of the BBC's television was performed live. Nonetheless, there was a certain degree of pre-shooting in the form of inserts on film, which could be played into the studio and broadcast as part of the play to cover changes of scene or show location material which would have been impossible to mount live in the studio. Initial filming for Nineteen Eighty-Four took place on 10 November 1954 in Studio B of Alexandra Palace (even by then all but abandoned as a venue for shooting drama, although it housed the news and later the Open University for the next thirty years), with footage of the Two Minutes' Hate and some of the canteen scenes being filmed there.\nFurther location shooting took place on 18 November which were exterior scenes featuring Smith's travels in the proletarian sector. According to Peter Cushing, speaking on Late Night Line-Up in 1965, these scenes were filmed on the demolition site that became BBC Television Centre. Following the filming, rehearsals for the cast began at Mary Ward Settlement, Tavistock Place from 22 November (moving to 60 Paddington Street from 29 November). During these rehearsals, the cast memorised their lines and cues as important in a live television production as in a stage play.\nThe cast and crew moved to Studio D at the BBC's Lime Grove Studios on Saturday 11 December 1954 for a full camera rehearsal and run-through. Rehearsals continued the following day until shortly before transmission, which began at 20:37 Sunday 12 December and continued for the best part of two hours.\nKneale's script was a largely faithful adaptation of the novel as far as was practical. The writer made some small additions, the most notable being the creation of a sequence in which O'Brien observes Julia at work in PornoSec and reads a small segment from one of the erotic novels being written by the machines."

        "content": "The play provoked something of an upset. There were complaints about the \"horrific\" content (particularly the Room 101 scene where Smith is threatened with torture by rats) and the \"subversive\" nature of the play. Most were worried by the depiction of a totalitarian regime controlling the population's freedom of thought. There was also a report in the Daily Express newspaper of 42-year-old Beryl Merfin of Herne Bay collapsing and dying as she watched the production, under the headline \"Wife dies as she watches\", allegedly from the shock of what she had seen. An anonymous reviewer in The Times wrote: \"Inevitably, in a dramatic presentation of the book much of the irony is lost; and the weakness of this television version was that concentrating on the action it reduced the ideological explanation so drastically that it robbed the story of at least half its power\". It was a \"pictorial simplification\" of \"Orwell's vision\". The writer, however, admired the performances of Cushing, Mitchell and Morell. The Manchester Guardian reviewer defended the BBC for screening the drama, while The Daily Worker, a communist newspaper, described it as a \"Tory guttersnipe\u2019s view of socialism\".Political reaction was divided, with several early day motions and amendments tabled in the Parliament. One motion, signed by five MPs, deplored \"the tendency, evident in recent British Broadcasting Corporation television programmes, notably on Sunday evenings, to pander to sexual and sadistic tastes\". An amendment was tabled which sought to make the motion now deplore \"the tendency of honourable members to attack the courage and enterprise of the British Broadcasting Corporation in presenting plays and programmes capable of appreciation by adult minds, on Sunday evenings and other occasions.\" It was signed by five MPs. Another amendment added \"but is thankful that the freedom of the individual still permits viewers to switch off and, due to the foresight of her Majesty's Government, will soon permit a switch-over to be made to more appropriate programmes.\" A second motion signed by six MPs, applauded \"the sincere attempts of the BBC. to bring home to the British people the logical and soul-destroying consequences of the surrender of their freedom\" and calling attention to the fact that \"many of the inhuman practices depicted in the play Nineteen Eighty-Four are already in common use under totalitarian r\u00e9gimes.\", Even the Queen and Prince Philip made it known that they had watched and enjoyed the play.Amidst objections the BBC went ahead with a complete live restaging on Thursday 16 December. This was introduced live on camera by Head of Drama Michael Barry, who had already appeared on the topical news programme Panorama on 15 December to defend the production. The seven million viewers who watched the Thursday performance was the largest television audience in the UK since the Coronation the previous year.\nAt the time, television images could only be preserved on film by using a special recording apparatus (known as \"telerecording\" in the UK and \"kinescoping\" in the USA) but was used sparingly in Britain for preservation and not for pre-recording. It is thus the second performance, one of the earliest surviving British television dramas, that is preserved in the archives."

        "content": "\"Treehouse of Horror II\" is the seventh episode of the third season of the American animated television series The Simpsons. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 31, 1991. It is the second annual Treehouse of Horror episode, consisting of three self-contained segments, told as dreams of Lisa, Bart and Homer and is the only Treehouse of Horror episode to date where each segment name is not stated inside the episode. In the first segment, which was inspired by W. W. Jacobs's short story The Monkey's Paw and The Twilight Zone episode \"A Small Talent for War\", Homer buys a Monkey's Paw that has the power to grant wishes, although all the wishes backfire. In the second part, which parodies the Twilight Zone episode \"It's a Good Life\", Bart is omnipotent, and turns Homer into a jack-in-the-box, resulting in the two spending more time together. In the final segment, Mr. Burns attempts to use Homer's brain to power a giant robotic laborer.\nThe episode was written by Al Jean, Mike Reiss, Jeff Martin, George Meyer, Sam Simon and John Swartzwelder while Jim Reardon was the director. The episode is presented in a similar format to the previous season's \"Treehouse of Horror\" and contains several similarities to the previous episode, such as Marge's opening warning, the tombstones in the opening credits and the appearance of the alien characters Kang and Kodos. \"Treehouse of Horror II\" was the first episode that employed the \"scary names\" idea, in which many of the credits have unusual names. The episode contains numerous parodies and references to horror and science fiction works, including The Twilight Zone, Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, The Thing with Two Heads and Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\nIn its original airing on Fox, the episode had a 12.1 Nielsen rating and finished the week ranked 39th. The episode received positive reviews, and in 2006, IGN listed the third story as the eighth best Treehouse of Horror segment. The episode was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards: Outstanding Individual Achievement in Sound Mixing for a Comedy Series or a Special and Alf Clausen for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series."

        "content": "After eating too much Halloween candy, Homer, Lisa and Bart have nightmares.\nIn Lisa's nightmare, Homer buys a cursed monkey's paw that will grant its owner four wishes. While he, Bart and Lisa argue, Marge pleads with them to heed the vendor's warning and not use it at all. Despite this, Maggie is granted the first wish: a new pacifier. Bart wishes for the Simpsons to be rich and famous, but the public soon tires of the family's antics and ubiquity. Horrified by the wasteful wishes, Lisa wishes for world peace, but aliens Kang and Kodos enslave the defenseless Earth. Determined to make a harmless wish, Homer demands a turkey sandwich, but the turkey is dry. With all the wishes used, he gives the paw to his neighbor Ned, who wishes for the aliens to leave and transforms his home into a castle.\nIn Bart's nightmare, Springfield lives in fear of Bart's omnipotent powers, including the ability to read minds, magically move objects and turn living things into grotesque forms. When Homer refuses to turn off a football game so Bart can watch The Krusty the Clown Show, Bart transports him to the football stadium in place of the ball for a field goal kick. As Homer creeps into the house trying to surprise him with a blow to the head, Bart transforms Homer into a jack-in-the-box. After Dr. Marvin Monroe says Bart is desperate for attention from his father, Homer spends quality time with his son. Bart restores Homer's human form and they share a warm moment, causing Bart to wake up screaming.\nIn Homer's nightmare, he becomes a grave digger after Mr. Burns fires him for incompetence. While building a giant robotic laborer to replace human workers, Burns searches a graveyard for a human brain to implant in the robot. After mistaking Homer, asleep in an open grave, for a corpse, he removes his brain and places it in the robot. Since Robo-Homer is just as incompetent as the old Homer, Burns declares the experiment a failure. After restoring the brain to Homer's body, Burns kicks the robot, which topples over and crushes him. Homer wakes from the nightmare to find Burns' head grafted on his shoulder. Homer tries to reassure himself that he is only dreaming, but Burns' head insists otherwise."

        "content": "\"Treehouse of Horror II\", the second edition of the Treehouse of Horror series of episodes, was written by Al Jean, Mike Reiss, Jeff Martin, George Meyer, Sam Simon, and John Swartzwelder. Jim Reardon was the director. The episode is presented in a similar format to the previous season's \"Treehouse of Horror\", and contains several similarities to the previous episode, such as Marge's opening warning, the tombstones in the opening credits and the appearance of the alien characters Kang and Kodos. \"Treehouse of Horror II\" was the first episode that employed the \"scary names\" idea, in which many of the names in the opening and closing credits have unusual nicknames. The idea came from Al Jean, who was inspired by old issues of EC Comics. Although the names quickly became more silly than scary, there has been a wide variety of special credits. For example, the director's name is given as Jim \"Rondo\" Reardon, a reference to his idol, Rondo Hatton. The \"scary names\" became such a burden to write that they were cut for \"Treehouse of Horror XII\" and \"Treehouse of Horror XIII\", but after hearing complaints from the fans, Jean decided to bring them back. The alien characters Kang and Kodos had been introduced in the previous year. There was a debate about whether to include them in all Halloween specials after the episode; eventually, the writers agreed to make it a tradition.During the beginning of Lisa's dream, Hank Azaria faked some Arabic. Usually, the writers get inspiration for the Halloween specials from old horror stories, but recently, the writers tried to conceive of their own stories instead of creating more parodies. Also, when the Moroccan salesman tries to warn Homer Simpson, saying \"You'll be sorry\", the animators forgot to move his lips. They realized their error only after the broadcast. While writing the segment, Sam Simon, one of the writers, wanted the fingers to go down in such an order so they would eventually have the middle finger sticking up. Once the animation would have been complete, however, they could not have gone through; Fox would have refused to air the episode. They had considered the alternative of deliberately blurring the middle finger themselves, but decided that Fox would have also refused. For this episode, there were a lot of loop lines; for instance, the ending to Lisa's dream was added to the last second. As a result of the loop, they still retained Flanders's old house next to his newly created castle. In order to make the episode fill the time needed, the animators often extended the laughing time for Kang and Kodos.The second segment is based on The Twilight Zone television series episode \"It's a Good Life\". That episode had also inspired the third segment of Twilight Zone: The Movie, which starred Nancy Cartwright in her debut feature film role. The segment parodies the narration of The Twilight Zone, and the producers were pleased with Harry Shearer's portrayal of Rod Serling. (Shearer had previously impersonated Serling while he was a cast member on Saturday Night Live)  In addition, though it took a long time, the design of the monster version of Snowball II by Dale Hendrickson was greatly enjoyed by the producers, who thought it looked \"just hideous, just right\". Bart's prank call to Moe was thought of by John Swartzwelder, one of the writers; however, Hank Azaria detested the line. According to George Meyer, the animation for when Bart sits up screaming was extremely tough, especially to make the mouthlines natural.In the third segment, Burns and Smithers go down to the lab during Homer's nightmare. The animators decided to make the animation a bit more impressive, and decided to do the concave and convex images of Burns and Smithers. Even though it was tough and took up more time, the producers felt it was a necessary tour-de-force. Originally, Homer's robotic voice was done post-animation in order to avoid stress on the voice actor. Then-head writer Jay Kogen, who created the Davy Crockett joke, thought it was so funny he actually mimicked the actions of Mr. Burns putting on Homer's brain in the writing room; the producers thought it was hilarious, so they decided to add it into the episode."

Marge's hair in the opening segment recalls Elsa Lanchester's in Bride of Frankenstein.The plot of Lisa's nightmare is a parody of W. W. Jacobs's short story \"The Monkey's Paw\", and The New Twilight Zone episode \"A Small Talent for War\". Near the beginning of the segment, Moroccan soldiers stop and search the Simpsons, finding souvenirs taped to Homer's body which he was attempting to smuggle out of the country. This is a reference to the opening drug-smuggling scene of the film Midnight Express. A billboard advertisement with Bart saying \"Get a Mammogram, Man!\" can be seen. This was a reference to Bart's popular slogan \"Don't have a cow, man!\"The plot of Bart's nightmare is a parody of The Twilight Zone episode \"It's a Good Life\", which was remade as part of Twilight Zone: The Movie, which featured Nancy Cartwright in the role of Ethel. Jasper's transformation into a dog is a reference to the 1978 remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The scene in which Homer goes out with Bart to spend time with the boy, as well as the accompanying music, parody an old anti-smoking public service announcement, while the church layout was taken from a Norman Rockwell painting.Much of Homer's nightmare is based on the film Frankenstein, and the end references The Thing with Two Heads. While Mr. Burns scoops out Homer's brain, he hums the tune of \"If I Only Had a Brain\", sung by the Scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz. Burns also calls the robot that had Homer's brain a \"clinking, clattering cacophony of caliginous cogs and camshafts\", similar to the Wizard's line to the Tin Man: \"You clinking, clanking, clattering collection of caliginous junk!\" In Homer's nightmare, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson is broadcast on TV. When Mr. Burns puts on Homer's brain, he says \"Look at me! I'm Davy Crockett\", a reference to Crockett's popular image as a frontiersman who wore a hat made of raccoon fur."

The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Cameron Diaz, along with Jim Broadbent, John C. Reilly, Henry Thomas, Stephen Graham, Eddie Marsan, and Brendan Gleeson in supporting roles.\nThe film is set in 1863, when a long-running Catholic\u2013Protestant feud erupts into violence, just as an Irish immigrant group is protesting against the threat of conscription during the Civil War. Scorsese spent twenty years developing the project until Miramax Films acquired it in 1999. Principal photography took place in Cinecitt\u00e0, Rome and Long Island City, New York City.\nGangs of New York was completed by 2001 but its release was delayed due to the September 11 attacks. The film was theatrically released in the United States on December 20, 2002, and grossed over $193 million worldwide. It was met with generally positive reviews and Day-Lewis's performance was highly acclaimed. It received ten nominations at the 75th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for Scorsese and Best Actor for Day-Lewis."

At the end of the battle, Bill kills Vallon and declares the Dead Rabbits outlawed. Having witnessed this, Vallon's young son hides the knife that killed his father and is taken to an orphanage on Blackwell's Island.\nSixteen years later in the year 1862, Vallon's son, \"Amsterdam\" returns to the Five Points seeking revenge and retrieves the knife. An old acquaintance, Johnny Sirocco, familiarizes him with the local clans of gangs, all of whom pay tribute to Bill, who remains in control of the territory. Amsterdam is introduced to Bill but keeps his past a secret as he seeks recruitment into the gang. He learns many of his father's former lieutenants are now in Bill's employ, despite his deep anti-Irish views. Each year, Bill celebrates the anniversary of his victory over the Dead Rabbits and Amsterdam secretly plans to kill him publicly during this celebration. Amsterdam soon becomes attracted to pickpocket and grifter Jenny Everdeane, with whom Johnny is also infatuated. Amsterdam gains Bill's confidence and becomes his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, involving him in the dealings of corrupt Tammany Hall politician William M. Tweed. Amsterdam saves Bill from an assassination attempt and is tormented by the thought that he may have done so out of honest devotion.\nOn the evening of the anniversary, Johnny, in a fit of jealousy over Jenny's affection for Amsterdam, reveals Amsterdam's true identity and intentions to Bill. Bill baits Amsterdam with a knife throwing act involving Jenny. As Bill toasts Priest Vallon, Amsterdam throws his knife, but Bill deflects it and wounds Amsterdam with a counter throw. Bill then beats him and burns his cheek with a hot blade. Going into hiding, Jenny implores him to escape with her to San Francisco. Amsterdam, however, returns to the Five Points seeking vengeance and announces his return by hanging a dead rabbit in Paradise Square in front of several Irish gangs that were allied with the Dead Rabbits. Bill sends corrupt Irish policeman and former Dead Rabbit Mulraney to investigate, but Amsterdam garrotes him to death and hangs his body in the square. In retaliation, Bill has Johnny beaten and run through with a pike, leaving it to Amsterdam to end his suffering. When Amsterdam's gang beats McGloin, a former Dead Rabbit and one of Bill's lieutenants, Bill and the Natives march on the church and are met by Amsterdam and the Dead Rabbits. No violence ensues, but Bill promises to return soon. The incident garners newspaper coverage, and Amsterdam presents Tweed with a plan to defeat Bill's influence: Tweed will back the candidacy of Monk McGinn for sheriff and Amsterdam will secure the Irish vote for Tammany. Monk wins in a landslide, and a humiliated Bill murders him with his own club. McGinn's death prompts an angry Amsterdam to challenge Bill to a gang battle in Paradise Square, which Bill accepts.\nThe Civil War draft riots break out just as the gangs are preparing to fight, and Union Army soldiers are deployed to control the rioters. As the rival gangs fight, cannon fire from ships is directed into Paradise Square, interrupting their battle shortly before it begins. Many of the gang members are killed by the naval gunfire, soldiers, or rioters. Bill and Amsterdam face off against one another until Bill is wounded by shrapnel. Amsterdam then uses his father's knife to kill Bill.\nAmsterdam buries the knife next to his father in a cemetery in Brooklyn, erecting a makeshift headstone with the name William Cutting over it now alongside the actual tombstone of Priest Vallon. As Amsterdam and Jenny leave, the skyline changes as modern New York City is built over the next century, from the Brooklyn Bridge to the Empire State Building to the World Trade Center, and the cemetery becomes overgrown and forgotten."

At the time, he had noticed there were parts of his neighborhood that were much older than the rest, including tombstones from the 1810s in Old St. Patrick's Cathedral, cobblestone streets and small basements located under more recent large buildings; this sparked Scorsese's curiosity about the history of the area: \"I gradually realized that the Italian-Americans weren't the first ones there, that other people had been there before us. As I began to understand this, it fascinated me. I kept wondering, how did New York look? What were the people like? How did they walk, eat, work, dress?\""

        "content": "Scorsese received both praise and criticism for historical depictions in the film. In a PBS interview for the History News Network, George Washington University Professor Tyler Anbinder said that the visuals and discrimination of immigrants in the film were historically accurate, but both the amount of violence depicted and the number of Chinese, particularly female, immigrants were greater in the film than in reality.Asbury's book described the Bowery Boys, Plug Uglies, True Blue Americans, Shirt Tails, and Dead Rabbits, who were named after their battle standard, a dead rabbit on a pike. The book also described William Poole, the inspiration for William \"Bill the Butcher\" Cutting, a member of the Bowery Boys, a bare-knuckle boxer, and a leader of the Know Nothing political movement. Poole did not come from the Five Points and was assassinated nearly a decade before the Draft Riots. Both the fictional Bill and the real one had butcher shops, but Poole is not known to have killed anyone. The book also described other famous gangsters from the era such as Red Rocks Farrell, Slobbery Jim and Hell-Cat Maggie, who filed her front teeth to points and wore artificial brass fingernails.Anbinder said that Scorsese's recreation of the visual environment of mid-19th-century New York City and the Five Points \"couldn't have been much better\". All sets were built completely on the exterior stages of Cinecitt\u00e0 Studios in Rome. By 1860, New York City had 200,000 mostly Catholic Irish immigrants in a population of 800,000.According to Paul S. Boyer, \"The period from the 1830s to the 1850s was a time of almost continuous disorder and turbulence among the urban poor. The decade from 1834\u20131844 saw more than 200 major gang wars in New York City alone, and in other cities the pattern was similar.\"As early as 1839, Mayor Philip Hone said: \"This city is infested by gangs of hardened wretches\" who \"patrol the streets making night hideous and insulting all who are not strong enough to defend themselves.\" The large gang fight depicted in the film as occurring in 1846 is fictional, though there was one between the Bowery Boys and Dead Rabbits in the Five Points on July 4, 1857, which is not mentioned in the film. Reviewer Vincent DiGirolamo concludes that \"Gangs of New York becomes a historical epic with no change over time. The effect is to freeze ethno-cultural rivalries over the course of three decades and portray them as irrational ancestral hatreds unaltered by demographic shifts, economic cycles and political realignments.\"In the film, the Draft Riots of July 1863 are depicted as both destructive and violent. Records indicate the riots resulted in more than one hundred deaths, including the lynching of 11 free African-Americans. They were especially targeted by the Irish, in part because of fears of job competition that more freed slaves would cause in the city. The bombardment of the city by Navy ships offshore to quell the riots is wholly fictitious. The film references the infamous Tweed Courthouse, as \"Boss\" Tweed refers to plans for the structure as being \"modest\" and \"economical\".In the film, Chinese Americans were common enough in the city to have their own community and public venues. Although Chinese people migrated to America as early as the 1840s, significant Chinese migration to New York City did not begin until 1869, the time when the transcontinental railroad was completed. The Chinese theater on Pell St. was not finished until the 1890s. The Old Brewery, the overcrowded tenement shown in the movie in both 1846 and 1862\u201363, was actually demolished in 1852."

A twenty-minute clip, billed as an \"extended preview\", debuted at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and was shown at a star-studded event at the Palais des Festivals et des Congr\u00e8s with Scorsese, DiCaprio, Diaz and Weinstein in attendance.Harvey Weinstein then wanted the film to open on December 25, 2002, but a potential conflict with another film starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Catch Me If You Can produced by DreamWorks, caused him to move the opening day to an earlier position. After negotiations between several parties, including the interests of DiCaprio, Weinstein and DreamWorks' Jeffrey Katzenberg, the decision was made on economic grounds: DiCaprio did not want to face a conflict of promoting two movies opening against each other; Katzenberg was able to convince Weinstein that the violence and adult material in Gangs of New York would not necessarily attract families on Christmas. Of main concern to all involved was attempting to maximize the film's opening day, an important part of film industry economics.After three years in production, the film was released on December 20, 2002, a year after its original planned release date.

He turns himself in and is sentenced to one to three years in state prison. Evans, however, plants undercover agent Hank Fallon (as \"Vic Pardo\") in Cody's cell. His task is to find the \"Trader\", a fence who launders stolen money for Cody.\nOn the outside, \"Big Ed\" Somers, Cody's ambitious right-hand man, takes charge. Verna betrays Cody and joins Ed. Ed pays inmate Roy Parker to kill Cody. In the prison workshop, Parker attempts to drop a heavy piece of machinery on Cody, but Hank pushes Cody out of the way, saving his life and gaining Cody's trust. Ma visits and vows to \"take care of\" Big Ed, despite Cody's frantic attempts to dissuade her. He starts worrying and decides to break out with Hank. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Verna has murdered Ma, whom she despised (as well as vice versa), by shooting her in the back.  Big Ed knows this and holds this information over Verna to keep her with him. When Cody learns of Ma's death from a new inmate, he goes berserk in the mess hall.

Cody plans to steal a chemical plant's payroll by using an empty tanker truck as a Trojan horse.  Hank says he will repair Verna's radio, then rigs a signal transmitter and attaches it to the Trojan tanker; on the way to the plant, he manages to get a message to Evans. The police track the tanker and prepare an ambush.\nThe gang gets into the payroll office, but the tanker driver, ex-con \"Bo\" Creel, recognizes Hank and informs Cody. Having tracked the truck to Long Beach, California, using direction finders, the police surround the building and call on Cody to surrender; he decides to fight it out. When the police fire tear gas into the office, Hank manages to escape. In the ensuing gun battle, the police kill most of Cody's gang and Verna is arrested. Cody shoots one of his own men for trying to surrender. Finally, only Cody is still loose. He flees to the top of a gigantic, globe-shaped gas storage tank. After Hank shoots Cody several times with a rifle, Cody fires at the tank, which bursts into flames. He shouts \"Made it, Ma! Top of the world!\" before the tank explodes."

A variation of the quote\u2014\"Top of the world, ma!\"\u2014appears in the 1986 movie Tough Guys during a scene in which Eli Wallach shoots at cops from a train; the same variation is used in the 1990 film The Adventures of Ford Fairlane by Andrew Dice Clay when he escapes kidnappers and discovers that he is atop the Capitol Records Building.  It has also been quoted in a fifth-season episode of Cheers, a second-season episode of Breaking Bad and the series finale of Mixels.  The line is also quoted in the Kings of the Sun song \"Drop the Gun\".\nThe film has inspired songs such as Madonna's \"White Heat\" on True Blue; the song was also dedicated to Cagney. Sam Baker's \"White Heat\" references the plot and dialogue on his 2013 album Say Grace.The \"Made it ma!

        "content": "The Third Man is a 1949 film noir directed by Carol Reed, written by Graham Greene, and starring Joseph Cotten, Alida Valli, Orson Welles and Trevor Howard, set in post-war Vienna. The film centres on American Holly Martins (Cotten) who arrives in the city to accept a job with his friend Harry Lime (Welles), only to learn that Lime has died. Martins decides to stay in Vienna and investigate his death.\nThe atmospheric use of black-and-white expressionist cinematography by Robert Krasker, harsh lighting, and subtle \"Dutch angle\" camera technique are major features of The Third Man, combined with the theme music by Anton Karas, bombed-out locations, and acclaimed performances from the cast. The style evokes the atmosphere of an exhausted, cynical, post-war Vienna at the start of the Cold War.\nGreene wrote the novella as preparation for the screenplay. Karas's title composition \"The Third Man Theme\" topped the international music charts in 1950, bringing international fame to the previously unknown performer. The Third Man is considered one of the greatest films of all time, celebrated for its acting, musical score, and atmospheric cinematography.In 1999, the British Film Institute voted The Third Man the greatest British film of all time. In 2011, a poll for Time Out ranked it the second-best British film ever."

        "content": "Holly Martins, an American author of western fiction, arrives in post-World War II Vienna seeking his childhood friend, Harry Lime, who has offered him a job. However, Martins is told that Lime has been killed by a car while crossing the street. At Lime's funeral, Martins meets two British Royal Military Police: Sergeant Paine, a fan of Martins' books, and Major Calloway. Afterward, Martins is asked by Mr. Crabbin to lecture at a book club a few days later. He then meets a friend of Lime's, \"Baron\" Kurtz, who tells Martins that he and another friend, Popescu, carried Lime to the side of the street after the accident, and that, before he died, Lime asked them to take care of Martins and Lime's girlfriend, actress Anna Schmidt.\nAs Martins and Anna query Lime's death, they realise that accounts differ as to whether Lime was able to speak before his death, and whether two men carried away the body, or three. The porter at Lime's apartment tells them that he saw a third man helping carry away the body. Later, the porter offers to give Martins more information, but he is murdered before Martins can talk to him again. Martins confronts Major Calloway and demands that Lime's death be investigated. Calloway reveals that Lime was stealing penicillin from military hospitals with the help of an orderly, diluting it, then selling it on the black market, injuring or killing countless adults and children. Martins, convinced by hard evidence, agrees to drop his investigation and leave. (Why the orderly is killed and the original pretense of it being Lime is never explained.)\nThat evening, Martins visits Anna, with whom he is falling in love. Outside, a man crosses the street towards her front door, but moves away after seeing Martins at the window. After leaving, Martins walks the streets, until he notices Anna's cat and realises someone is watching from a darkened doorway. In a momentary flash of light, Martin sees that the man is Harry Lime. Martins calls out but Lime flees and vanishes. Martins summons Calloway, who realises that Lime has escaped through the city's extensive sewers to the Russian sector. The British police exhume Lime's coffin and discover that the body is that of the missing orderly who stole the penicillin for Lime. Anna, who is Czech, is to be sent to the Soviet sector, and is questioned again by Calloway.\nMartins goes to Kurtz and asks to see Lime. They meet and speak as they ride the Wiener Riesenrad. Lime obliquely threatens Martins before leaving quickly. Calloway then asks Martins to help arrest Lime. Martins agrees to help on one condition, demanding Anna's safe conduct out of Vienna. Anna is about to leave on the train when she spots Martins, who has come to observe her departure. She persuades him to reveal the plan but wants no part of it. Exasperated, Martins decides to leave Vienna, but on the way to the airport, Calloway stops at a hospital to show Martins children crippled or dying of meningitis who were treated with Lime's diluted penicillin. Martins again agrees to help the police .\nLime arrives at a small caf\u00e9 to meet Martins, but Anna is able to warn Lime that the police are closing in. He tries again to escape using the sewer tunnels, but the police are prepared and pursue him below ground. Lime shoots and kills Sgt. Paine, but Calloway shoots and badly wounds Lime. Injured, Lime drags himself up a cast-iron stairway to a street grating, but he cannot lift it. Martins finds Lime at the grating and they exchange a look. They hear Calloway shouting that Martins must take no chances and that if he finds Lime he must shoot him on sight. Trapped, and still looking at his old friend, Lime nods his head slightly and Martins shoots and kills him, using Paine's revolver.\nMartins attends Lime's second funeral, at the risk of missing his flight out of Vienna. He waits on the cemetery path to speak with Anna, but she ignores him, walking past without glancing in his direction."

Andie's best friend, an outsider named Philip \"Duckie\" Dale, is in love with her, but is afraid to tell her how he truly feels. In school, Duckie and Andie, along with their friends, are harassed and bullied by the arrogant \"richie\" and popular kids, specifically Benny Hanson and her boyfriend, Steff McKee, who finds Andie attractive and secretly resents having been rejected by her.\nWhile working after school at a record store called Trax, Andie starts talking about her school's senior prom to her manager, Iona, who advises Andie to go, despite not having a date. Blane McDonnagh, one of the preppy boys and Steff's best friend, falls for Andie and eventually asks her out.\nOn the night of the date, Andie waits for Blane at Trax, but he is late. Duckie enters and asks Andie to go out with him, but she ignores him. When Blane arrives, Duckie becomes upset and argues with Andie before storming off. Blane brings Andie to Steff's house party, where Andie is mistreated by the rich partygoers. Andie then brings Blane to a local nightclub, where Iona is sitting with Duckie, who is hostile and jealous toward Blane. After another argument with Duckie, Andie and Blane walk out of the club. Andie tells Blane that she wants to go home, but refuses to let him bring her there, admitting that she doesn't want him to see where she lives. She eventually allows him to drop her off and he asks her to the prom and they share their first kiss. Andie visits Iona the next day to talk about the date. Meanwhile, Blane, pressured by Steff, Benny, and rich friends, begins distancing himself from Andie.\nJack presents Andie with a pink dress that he has bought for her. However, they begin to argue because Jack has been lying about going to a full-time job. Jack breaks down, revealing that he is still bitter and depressed about his wife having left him. At school, Andie confronts Blane for avoiding her and not returning her calls. When asked about the prom, he claims that he had already asked somebody else but had forgotten. Andie calls Blane a liar and tells him that he is ashamed of being seen with her because he knows his rich friends will not approve. Andie runs away as a teary-eyed Blane leaves, with Steff trashing Andie as he passes. Duckie overhears Steff and attacks him in the hallway. The two fight before teachers intervene. Andie goes to Iona, upset about what happened, and asks for Iona's old prom dress.\nUsing the fabric from Iona's dress and the dress that her father had bought, Andie creates a pink prom dress. When she arrives at the prom, Andie has second thoughts about braving the crowd on her own until she sees Duckie. They reconcile and walk into the ballroom hand in hand. As a drunk Steff begins mocking the couple, Blane confronts him and finally realizes that Steff resents Andie because she had turned down his advances. He calls Steff out on his spoiled and entitled attitude, saying that he no longer wishes to associate with him. Blane shakes Duckie's hand and apologizes to Andie, telling her that he always believed in her and that he will always love her, kissing her cheek before walking out. Duckie concedes that Blane is not like the other rich kids at school and advises Andie to go after him, joking that he will never take her to another prom if she does not. Duckie then sees a girl smiling at him, signaling him to come over and dance with her. Andie catches up with Blane in the parking lot and they kiss."

John Hughes wrote a new five-page ending where Andie and Blane get together instead. This was shot several months after the film wrapped production, and was filmed in one day on a soundstage designed to look like the Los Angeles hotel ballroom where the first ending had been filmed.  When called back to film the new scene, Andrew McCarthy was in pre-production for a stage play, and had lost weight and cut his hair for the stage role, so he was fitted with a wig for the re-shoot. Molly Ringwald had anticipated that audiences would be dissatisfied with the original ending, saying: \"It didn't make sense to have the entire movie be this Cinderella story [yet] she doesn't get to end up with the guy she wants.\" Ringwald has said Duckie was based on her best friend, who was gay and with whom she \"had an extremely nonromantic relationship\".Jon Cryer has stated that he was shocked that the test audience was unhappy about the pairing, and felt that the whole film was built around Andie and Duckie ending up together. Hughes aimed \"to protect Duckie's character\" in the new ending by having another girl at the prom show interest in him, played by Kristy Swanson in her first theatrical film role and credited as \"Duckette\". Paramount executives were also apprehensive about the original ending, worried that the film might be perceived as classist and as suggesting that wealthy people and poor people should not interact. Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark had written the song \"Goddess of Love\" for the original ending (which they later rewrote and released on the album The Pacific Age). Hughes didn't consider the song a good fit for the newly re-shot Andie/Blane ending and asked the band to write something else. With only two days before going on tour, OMD wrote \"If You Leave\" in less than 24 hours. Paramount has said that they have been unable to locate the footage of the original ending."

        "content": "The Grand Budapest Hotel is a 2014 comedy-drama film written, directed, and co-produced by Wes Anderson. Ralph Fiennes leads a seventeen-actor ensemble cast as Monsieur Gustave H., famed concierge of a twentieth-century mountainside resort in the fictional Eastern European country of Zubrowka. When Gustave is framed for the murder of a wealthy dowager (Tilda Swinton), he and his recently befriended prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Zero (Tony Revolori) embark on a quest for fortune and a priceless Renaissance painting amidst the backdrop of an encroaching fascist regime. Anderson's American Empirical Pictures produced the film in association with Studio Babelsberg, Fox Searchlight Pictures, and Indian Paintbrush's Scott Rudin and Steven Rales. Fox Searchlight supervised the commercial distribution, and The Grand Budapest Hotel's funding was sourced through Indian Paintbrush and German government-funded tax rebates.\nAnderson and longtime collaborator Hugo Guinness conceived The Grand Budapest Hotel as a fragmented tale following a character inspired by a common friend. They initially struggled in their brainstorming, but the experience touring Europe and researching the literature of Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig shaped their vision for the film. The Grand Budapest Hotel draws visually from Europe-set mid-century Hollywood films and the United States Library of Congress's photochrom print collection of alpine resorts. Filming took place in eastern Germany from January to March 2013. French composer Alexandre Desplat composed the symphonic, Russian folk-inspired score, which expanded on his early work with Anderson. The film explores themes of fascism, nostalgia, friendship, and loyalty, and further studies analyze the function of color as an important storytelling device.\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel premiered in competition at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival on February 6, 2014. The French theatrical release on February 26 preceded the film's global rollout, followed by releases in Germany, North America, and the United Kingdom on March 6\u20137. The Grand Budapest Hotel received critical acclaim, with reviewers singling out its cast and craftsmanship for praise, though occasional criticism centered on the film's approach to subject matter, fragmented storytelling, and characterization. It earned $174 million in box office revenue worldwide, Anderson's highest-grossing feature to date. The film was nominated for nine awards at the 87th Academy Awards including Best Picture, winning four, and received numerous other accolades. Since its release, The Grand Budapest Hotel has been assessed as one of the greatest films of the 21st century."

The book, written in 1985, recounts the 1968 vacation of the young writer at the once-grand, then-drab hotel. There, he meets its owner, Zero Moustafa, who tells his rags to riches story at dinner.\nIn 1932, Zero is an illegal refugee escaping a war waged by a fascist regime, which killed his entire family. He is hired as a lobby boy supervised by Monsieur Gustave H., the hotel's concierge. Gustave strikes up affairs with old, wealthy clients, including dowager Madame C\u00e9line Villeneuve Desgoffe-und-Taxis (known as Madame D.), who secretly owns the hotel. She mysteriously dies a month after her last hotel visit so Gustave and Zero visit her estate, where relatives come for the reading of her will. There, her attorney, Deputy Vilmos Kovacs, announces a recent codicil which bequeaths the famous Renaissance painting Boy with Apple to Gustave. Madame D.'s son and an agent of the regime, Dmitri, refuses to let it happen. Gustave and Zero abscond with the painting, hiding it in a safe in the Grand Budapest.\nAfter a testimony by Madame D.'s butler Serge X, Gustave is arrested by Inspector Alfred J. Henckels for Madame D.'s murder; Serge then goes into hiding. Gustave befriends a gang during his imprisonment and provides them with pastries from Mendl's, a well-known bakery. After extensive research of the prison, one of Gustave's cellmates, Ludwig, tells the gang that they can escape via a storm-drain sewage system. Convinced to join the prison break, Gustave has Zero place hammers, chisels, and sawblades inside pastries made by Agatha, an apprentice of Herr Mendl and Zero's fianc\u00e9e. The guard responsible for checking contraband cannot bring himself to break open the pastries since Mendl's pastries are works of art. During the prison break, the group of convicts runs into guards who secretly gamble at night, and convict Gunther is forced to sacrifice himself to dispatch the guards. The rest of the group manages to escape and disperse. Meanwhile, Dmitri sends his hitman, J. G. Jopling, to kill Kovacs after questioning his loyalty, as well as Serge's sister for hiding his whereabouts.\nWhen Zero and Gustave are reunited, they set out to prove Gustave's innocence with the assistance of a fraternity of concierges known as the Society of the Crossed Keys, which locates Serge and facilitates a meeting between him, Gustave and Zero. Serge reveals that he was pressured to implicate Gustave by the real killer, Dmitri, and that Madame D. had a missing second will, which would only take effect should she be murdered. Jopling arrives and kills Serge, leaving Gustave and Zero without a witness, then tries to flee. After a chase through the snow, Gustave is left dangling of a cliff at the mercy of Jopling. Before it is too late, Zero rescues Gustave by pushing Jopling off the cliff, and the two men continue their escape from swarming Zubrowkan troops led by Henckels.\nGustave, Zero, and Agatha return to the Grand Budapest to find it converted into a fascist headquarters by Dmitri. Agatha sneaks in to retrieve the painting but is spotted by Dmitri. Gustave and Zero rush in to save Agatha, but Dmitri shoots at them and initiates a melee with Zubrowkan troops, which Henckels stops. At the back of the painting, Agatha finds Madame D.'s second will, which makes Gustave the hotel owner. He is exonerated in court, while Dmitri becomes the main suspect and flees the country. Over time, Gustave becomes one of the wealthiest Zubrowkans, and Zero and Agatha are wed. However, while the three are later traveling by train, soldiers come by and destroy Zero's refugee documents; Gustave tries to fend them off but is killed. His own will bequeaths the hotel and his fortune to Zero. He maintains the Grand Budapest up to its eventual demolition in memory of Agatha who, like their infant son, died from Prussian Grippe."

Jaffe and his witch doctor Baba reveal to Akeem that he had sired a bastard son during his first visit to Queens, New York, many years ago, after his aide and long-time friend Semmi had enticed two women into spending the night with them while Akeem was still searching for his future queen, resulting in a tryst he did not remember. As Zamundian tradition demands that only a male successor can inherit the throne, and Akeem has fathered only daughters, he is forced to find his son. Otherwise, Zamunda could face a hostile takeover by Zamunda's militaristic neighbor nation Nexdoria, whose dictator, General Izzi has been pushing for Akeem's eldest daughter Meeka to marry his foppish son, Idi.\nFollowing King Jaffe's funeral and Akeem's ascension to the throne, he and Semmi return to Queens to find his illegitimate son, using a sketch Baba has provided. Reuniting with the barbershop gang they befriended with years earlier, head barber Mr. Clarence recognizes the picture as Lavelle Junson, a ticket scalper who hustles outside of Madison Square Garden. After an awkward reunion with Lavelle's mother Mary, Akeem takes them back to Zamunda, much to his family's displeasure. When General Izzi learns of this, he introduces his daughter Bopoto to Lavelle as a last attempt at laying claim to the throne of Zamunda, but in order to qualify as a royal prince, Lavelle first has to pass a series of traditional tests.\nLavelle bonds with Mirembe, a royal groomer, who tells him of Akeem's quest to find his queen and encourages him to follow his own path. Lavelle then invites his uncle, Reem, to Zamunda, who coaches him on how to blend his urban upbringing with his new royal status. Lavelle gradually develops an understanding with Akeem's family, passes the tests, and is made Prince of Zamunda. However, at his accession party, Lavelle overhears a conversation between Akeem and Izzi which makes him believe that Akeem is exploiting him, and he, Mirembe, Mary and Reem go back to New York. Lisa confronts Akeem about his conservatism, and after a pep talk from his father-in-law Cleo, Akeem flies back to the States, while Semmi is left to defend the kingdom from Izzi.\nIn Queens, Akeem finds that Lavelle and Mirembe are about to get married. Confronted by Lavelle and reminded of his own life story, he gives them his blessing and releases Lavelle from his marriage to Bopoto. When Mirembe expresses reluctance in cutting all of their ties to Zamunda, Akeem offers to fly Mary's family back for a proper wedding. In the meantime, Semmi and the princesses, all trained staff fighters, fight off and subdue Izzi and his soldiers when they invade the palace, forcing Izzi to try a more diplomatic approach.\nUpon his return home, Akeem changes the royal succession by allowing his daughter Meeka to ascend to the throne upon his death, Lavelle is made an ambassador to the United States, and General Izzi has opened Nexdoria for a peaceful political and trading relationship with Zamunda. The film concludes with a grand party at the royal palace to celebrate Lavelle and Mirembe's marriage, including the barbers from Queens as special guests and a performance of the song \"We Are Family\" from Sexual Chocolate."

After an especially hard day in Rome, her doctor gives her an injection and advises: \"Best thing I know is to do exactly what you wish for a while.\" She secretly leaves the embassy to explore the city and, as the drug takes effect, falls asleep atop a low wall, where Joe Bradley, an American reporter, finds her. Without recognizing her, he thinks she is intoxicated and takes her to his apartment to sleep it off.\nJoe oversleeps and misses the princess's press conference, but claims to his editor, Hennessy, that he attended. Hennessy shows him a news item about the cancellation of the press conference due to the princess's \"sudden illness\". Joe recognizes the picture as the woman asleep in his apartment. Joe asks Hennessy what he would pay for an exclusive interview with the princess. Hennessy offers $5000, and counters with a $500 bet that Joe will not be able to get it.\n\nJoe calls his photographer friend, Irving Radovich, and offers to show \"Anya\" around Rome, without revealing that he is a reporter. Ann cites an important appointment and leaves. Joe follows and sees her explore an outdoor market, buy shoes, and get her long hair cut short. Joe contrives to meet her on the Spanish Steps and convinces her to spend the day with him, taking her to a street caf\u00e9 to meet up with Irving, who takes pictures with a camera concealed in his cigarette lighter. Ann claims to be playing truant from school. When Ann drives Joe through heavy Roman traffic on a Vespa, they are arrested, but Joe and Irving show their \"fake\" press passes and they are released. They tour the Colosseum, and each puts their hand in the Mouth of Truth; Joe tricks Ann into thinking that his hand has been bitten off.\nAt a dance on a boat, agents from Ann's government try to forcibly take her back. Ann joins Joe and Irving in the fight that breaks out. When Joe is knocked into the river, Ann jumps in after him. They swim away and kiss as they sit shivering on the riverbank. While drying their wet clothes at Joe's apartment, a radio bulletin says that the people of Princess Ann's country are concerned that her illness may be serious. Ann asks Joe to drive her to a corner near the embassy, where they kiss again. She bids him a tearful farewell.\nUpon her return, the princess replies to those attempting to remind her of her duty, \"Were I not completely aware of my duty to my family and my country, I would not have come home tonight..or indeed ever again.\"\nJoe tells a disbelieving Hennessy that he did not get the story, although he tells Irving he cannot stop him from selling the photographs. Joe and Irving attend the postponed press conference, to Princess Ann's surprise. She asserts her faith in relations between nations just as between people, and Joe assures her that her faith is not misplaced. When asked which city she most enjoyed visiting, she begins to say it would be difficult ... before declaring \"Rome. By all means, Rome.\" Other photographers take pictures with their large press cameras, while Irving makes a show of using his cigarette lighter. Ann speaks briefly with each journalist, and Irving presents her with his photographs as a memento of Rome. Joe remains behind after everyone else leaves, before walking from the room."

Peck's contract gave him solo star billing, with newcomer Hepburn listed much less prominently in the credits. Halfway through the filming, Peck suggested to Wyler that he elevate her to equal billing\u2014an almost unheard-of gesture in Hollywood.Wyler had initially considered Elizabeth Taylor and Jean Simmons for the princess role, but both were unavailable.

Wyler wrote to Dickinson, saying that \"as a result of the test, a number of the producers at Paramount have expressed interest in casting her.\" Roman Holiday was not Hepburn's first acting role, as she had appeared in Dutch and British films from 1948 and on stage, but it was her first major film role and her first appearance in an American film. Wyler wanted an \"anti-Italian\" actress who was different from the curvy Italian stars of that era: \"She was perfect ... his new star had no arse, no tits, no tight-fitting clothes, no high heels.

The film also opened the same week in two theatres in Portland, Oregon, on a double bill with Murder Without Tears, grossing $14,000.The film received critical acclaim and is now considered a classic. Milton Luban of The Hollywood Reporter said the movie \"proves a charming, laugh-provoking affair that often explodes into hilarity. ... it has a delightful screenplay that sparkles with wit and outrageous humor that at times comes close to slapstick\" and that the \"cinematographers do a fine job of incorporating Roman landmarks into the storyline\".

        "content": "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (German: Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari) is a 1920 German silent horror film directed by Robert Wiene and written by Hans Janowitz and Carl Mayer. Considered the quintessential work of German Expressionist cinema, it tells the story of an insane hypnotist (Werner Krauss) who uses a brainwashed somnambulist (Conrad Veidt) to commit murders. The film features a dark, twisted visual style, with sharp-pointed forms, oblique, curving lines, structures and landscapes that lean and twist in unusual angles, and shadows and streaks of light painted directly onto the sets.\nThe script was inspired by various experiences from the lives of Janowitz and Mayer, both pacifists who were left distrustful of authority after their experiences with the military during World War I. The film makes use of a frame story, with a prologue and epilogue combined with a twist ending. Janowitz said this device was forced upon the writers against their will. The film's design was handled by Hermann Warm, Walter Reimann and Walter R\u00f6hrig, who recommended a fantastic, graphic style over a naturalistic one.\nThe film thematizes brutal and irrational authority. Writers and scholars have argued the film reflects a subconscious need in German society for a tyrant, and is an example of Germany's obedience to authority and unwillingness to rebel against deranged authority. Some critics have interpreted Caligari as representing the German war government, with Cesare symbolic of the common man conditioned, like soldiers, to kill.  Other themes of the film include the destabilized contrast between insanity and sanity, the subjective perception of reality, and the duality of human nature.\nThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari was released when foreign film industries were easing restrictions on the import of German films after World War I, so it was screened internationally. Accounts differ as to its financial and critical success upon release, but modern film critics and historians have largely praised it as a revolutionary film. The film was voted number 12 on the prestigious Brussels 12 list at the 1958 World Expo. Critic Roger Ebert called it arguably \"the first true horror film\", and reviewer Danny Peary called it cinema's first cult film and a precursor for arthouse films. The film helped draw worldwide attention to the artistic merit of German cinema, and had a major influence on American films, particularly in the genres of horror and film noir."

When a dazed woman passes them, Francis explains she is his \"fianc\u00e9e\" Jane and that they have suffered a great ordeal. Most of the rest of the film is a flashback of Francis' story, which takes place in Holstenwall, a shadowy village of twisted buildings and spiraling streets. \nFrancis and his friend Alan, who are good-naturedly competing for Jane's affections, plan to visit the town fair. Meanwhile, a mysterious man named Dr. Caligari seeks a permit from the rude town clerk to present a spectacle at the fair, which features Cesare, a somnambulist. The clerk mocks and berates Caligari, but ultimately approves the permit. That night, the clerk is stabbed to death in his bed.\nThe next morning, Francis and Alan visit Caligari's sideshow attraction, where he opens a coffin-like box to reveal the sleeping Cesare. On Caligari's order, Cesare awakens and answers questions from the audience. Despite Francis' protests, Alan asks, \"How long shall I live?\" To Alan's horror, Cesare answers, \"The time is short. You die at dawn!\" Later that night, a figure breaks into Alan's home and stabs him to death in his bed. A grief-stricken Francis investigates Alan's murder with help from Jane and her father, Dr. Olsen, who obtains police authorization to investigate the somnambulist. That night, the police apprehend a criminal in possession of a knife who is caught attempting to murder an elderly woman. When questioned by Francis and Dr. Olsen, the criminal confesses he tried to kill the elderly woman, but denies any part in the two previous deaths; he was merely taking advantage of the situation to divert blame away from himself.\nAt night, Francis spies on Caligari and observes what appears to be Cesare sleeping in his box. However, the real Cesare sneaks into Jane's home as she sleeps. He raises a knife to stab her, but instead abducts her after a struggle, dragging her through the window onto the street. Chased by an angry mob, Cesare eventually drops Jane and flees; he soon collapses and dies of exhaustion. Francis confirms that the criminal who confessed to the elderly woman's murder is still locked away and could not have been Jane's attacker. Francis and the police investigate Caligari's sideshow and discover that the \"Cesare\" sleeping in the box is only a dummy. Caligari escapes in the confusion. Francis follows him and sees Caligari go into an insane asylum.\nUpon further investigation, Francis is shocked to learn that Caligari is the asylum's director. With help from the asylum staff, Francis studies the director's records and diary while the director is sleeping. The writings reveal his obsession with the story of an 18th-century mystic named Caligari, who used a somnambulist named Cesare to commit murders in northern Italian towns. The director, attempting to understand the earlier Caligari, experiments on a somnambulist admitted to the asylum, who becomes his Cesare. The asylum director screams, \"I must become Caligari!\" Francis and the doctors call the police to Caligari's office, where they show him Cesare's corpse. Caligari then attacks one of the staff. He is subdued, restrained in a straitjacket, and becomes an inmate in his own asylum.\nThe narrative returns to the present, where Francis concludes his story. In a twist ending, Francis is depicted as an asylum inmate. Jane and Cesare are patients as well; Jane believes that she is a queen, while Cesare is not a somnambulist but awake, quiet, and not visibly dangerous. The man Francis refers to as \"Dr. Caligari\" is the asylum director. Francis attacks him and is restrained in a straitjacket, then placed in the same cell where Caligari was confined in Francis's story. The asylum director announces, now that he understands Francis's delusion, that he is confident he can cure him."

        "content": "The visual style of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is dark, twisted and bizarre; radical and deliberate distortions in perspective, form, dimension and scale create a chaotic and unhinged appearance. The sets are dominated by sharp-pointed forms and oblique and curving lines, with narrow and spiraling streets, and structures and landscapes that lean and twist in unusual angles, giving the impression they could collapse or explode at any given moment. Film critic Roger Ebert described it as \"a jagged landscape of sharp angles and tilted walls and windows, staircases climbing crazy diagonals, trees with spiky leaves, grass that looks like knives\". The sets are characterized by strokes of bold, black paint. The landscape of Holstenwall is painted on canvas, as opposed to a constructed set, and shadows and streaks of light are painted directly onto the sets, further distorting the viewer's sense of perspective and three-dimensionality. Buildings are clustered and interconnected in a cubist-like architecture, surrounded by dark and twisted back alleys. Lotte Eisner, author of The Haunted Screen, writes that objects in the film appear as if they are coming alive and \"seem to vibrate with an extraordinary spirituality\". Rudolf Kurtz, screenwriter and author of Expressionismus und Film, likewise wrote \"the dynamic force of objects howls their desire to be created\". The rooms have radically offset windows with distorted frames, doors that are not squared, and chairs that are too tall. Strange designs and figures are painted on the walls of corridors and rooms, and trees outside have twisted branches that sometimes resemble tentacles.German film professor Anton Kaes wrote, \"The style of German Expressionism allowed the filmmakers to experiment with filmic technology and special effects and to explore the twisted realm of repressed desires, unconscious fears, and deranged fixations\". The visual style of Caligari conveys a sense of anxiety and terror to the viewer, giving the impression of a nightmare or deranged sensibility, or a place transformed by evil, in a more effective way than realistic locations or conventional design concepts could. Siegfried Kracauer wrote that the settings \"amounted to a perfect transformation of material objects into emotional ornaments\". The majority of the film's story and scenes are memories recalled by an insane narrator, and as a result the distorted visual style takes on the quality of his mental breakdown, giving the viewers the impression that they are inside the mind of a madman. As with contemporary Expressionist paintings, the visual style of Caligari reflects an emotional reaction to the world, and the film's characters represent an emotional response to the terror of society as embodied by Caligari and Cesare. Often in the film, set pieces are emblematic of the emotional state of the characters in the scene. For example, the courtyard of the insane asylum during the frame story is vastly out of proportion. The characters seem too big for the small building, and the courtyard floor features a bizarre pattern, all of which represent the patients' damaged frames of mind. Likewise, the scene with the criminal in a prison cell features a set with long vertical painted shadows resembling arrowheads, pointing down at the squatting prisoner in an oppressive effect that symbolizes his broken-down state.Stephen Brockmann argues the fact that Caligari was filmed entirely in a studio enhances the madness portrayed by the film's visuals because \"there is no access to a natural world beyond the realm of the tortured human psyche\". The sets occasionally feature circular images that reflect the chaos of the film, presenting patterns of movement that seem to be going nowhere, such as the merry-go-round at the fair, moving at a titled angle that makes it appear at risk of collapsing. Other elements of the film convey the same visual motifs as the sets, including the costumes and make-up design for Caligari and Cesare, both of which are highly exaggerated and grotesque. Even the hair of the characters is an Expressionistic design element, especially Cesare's black, spiky, jagged locks. They are the only two characters in the film with Expressionistic make-up and costumes, making them appear as if they are the only ones who truly belong in this distorted world. Despite their apparent normalcy, however, Francis and the other characters never appear disturbed by the madness around them reflected in the sets; they instead react as if they are parts of a normal background.A select few scenes disrupt the Expressionistic style of the film, such as in Jane's and Alan's home, which include normal backgrounds and bourgeois furniture that convey a sense of security and tranquility otherwise absent from the film. Eisner called this a \"fatal\" continuity error, but John D. Barlow disagrees, arguing it is a common characteristic for dream narratives to have some normal elements in them, and that the normalcy of Jane's house in particular could represent the feeling of comfort and refuge Francis feels in her presence. Mike Budd argues while the Expressionistic visual style is jarring and off-putting at first, the characters start to blend more harmoniously as the film progresses, and the setting becomes more relegated into the background.Robinson suggested Caligari is not a true example of Expressionism at all, but simply a conventional story with some elements of the art form applied to it. He argues the story itself is not Expressionistic, and the film could have easily been produced in a traditional style, but that Expressionist-inspired visuals were applied to it as decoration. Similarly, Budd has called the film a conventional, classical narrative, resembling a detective story in Francis's search to expose Alan's killer, and said it is only the film's Expressionist settings that make the film transgressive. Hans Janowitz has entertained similar thoughts as well: \"Was this particular style of painting only a garment in which to dress the drama? Was it only an accident? Would it not have been possible to change this garment, without injury to the deep effect of the drama? I do not know.\""

        "content": "Though often considered an art film by some modern critics and scholars, Caligari was produced and marketed the same way as a normal commercial production of its time period, able to target both the elite artistic market as well as a more commercial horror genre audience. The film was marketed extensively leading up to the release, and advertisements ran even before the film was finished. Many posters and newspaper advertisements included the enigmatic phrase featured in the film, \"Du musst Caligari werden!\", or \"You must become Caligari!\" Caligari premiered at the Marmorhaus theatre in Berlin on 26 February 1920, less than one month after it was completed. The filmmakers were so nervous about the release that Erich Pommer, on his way to the theatre, reportedly exclaimed, \"It will be a horrible failure for all of us!\" As with the making of the film, several urban legends surround the film's premiere. One, offered by writers Roger Manvell and Heinrich Fraenkel in The German Cinema, suggests the film was shelved \"for lack of a suitable outlet\", and was only shown at Marmorhaus because another film had fallen through. Another suggested the theatre pulled the film after only two performances because audiences demanded refunds and demonstrated against it so strongly. This story was told by Pommer, who claimed the Marmorhaus picked Caligari back up and ran it successfully for three months after he spent six months working on a publicity campaign for the film. David Robinson wrote that neither of these urban legends were true, and that the latter was fabricated by Pommer to increase his own reputation. On the contrary, Robinson said the premiere was highly successful, showing at the theatre for four weeks, an unusual amount for the time, and then returning two weeks later. He said it was so well received that women in the audience screamed when Cesare opened his eyes during his first scene, and fainted during the scene in which Cesare abducts Jane.Caligari was released at a time when foreign film industries had just started easing restrictions on the import of German films following World War I. The film was acquired for American distribution by the Goldwyn Distributing Company, and had its American premiere at the Capitol Theatre in New York City on 3 April 1921. It was given a live theatrical prologue and epilogue, which was not unusual for film premieres at major theatres at the time. In the prologue, the film is introduced by a character called \"Cranford\", who identifies himself as the man Francis speaks with in the opening scene. In the epilogue, Cranford returns and exclaims that Francis has fully recovered from his madness. Mike Budd believes these additions simplified the film and \"adjusted [it] for mass consumption\", though Robinson argued it was simply a normal theatrical novelty for the time. Capitol Theatre manager Samuel Roxy Rothafel commissioned conductor Ern\u00f6 Rap\u00e9e to compile a musical accompaniment that included portions of songs by composers Johann Strauss III, Arnold Schoenberg, Claude Debussy, Igor Stravinsky and Sergei Prokofiev. Rotafel wanted the score to match the dark mood of the film, saying: \"The music had, as it were, to be made eligible for citizenship in a nightmare country\".Caligari had its Los Angeles premiere at Miller's Theater on 7 May 1921, but the theatre was forced to pull it due to demonstrations by protestors. However, the protest was organized by the Hollywood branch of the American Legion due to fears of unemployment stemming from the import of German films into America, not over objections to the content of Caligari itself. After running in large commercial theatres, Caligari began to be shown in smaller theatres and film societies in major cities. Box office figures were not regularly published in the 1920s, so it has been difficult to assess the commercial success or failure of Caligari in the United States. Film historians Kristin Thompson and David B. Pratt separately studied trade publications from the time in an attempt to make a determination, but reached conflicting findings; Thompson concluded it was a box office success and Pratt concluded it was a failure. However, both agreed it was more commercially successful in major cities than in theatres in smaller communities, where tastes were considered more conservative.Caligari did not immediately receive a wide distribution in France due to fears over the import of German films, but film director Louis Delluc organized a single screening of it on 14 November 1921, at the Colis\u00e9e cinema in Paris as part of a benefit performance for the Spanish Red Cross. Afterward, the Cosmograph company bought the film's distribution rights and premiered it at the Cin\u00e9-Op\u00e9ra on 2 March 1922. Caligari played in one Paris theatre for seven consecutive years, a record that remained intact until the release of Emmanuelle (1974). According to Janowitz, Caligari was also shown in such European cities as London, Rome, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Brussels, Prague, Vienna, Budapest and Bucharest, as well as outside Europe in China, Japan, India and Turkey, and also in South American nations."

However, she is now married, and her husband John finds them together. John offers to show Paul his weapon collection, in particular his favorite hunting rifle. He deliberately loads it. Paul makes no move to escape and is shot by the jealous husband. As Paul feigns death, John claims to his wife, the sole witness, that it was an accident. Ethel finally realizes she loves John and tells him so; she agrees to support his story. Paul comes back to life, surprising the couple and telling them that John missed completely. Paul then leaves the couple, but later collapses in his limousine. He instructs his valet Luther to take him to the hospital to be treated.\nLater Luther offers the topcoat, complete with a bullet hole, as collateral for a $10 loan from his friend Edgar. Edgar is the butler of Harry Wilson, who is about to marry Diane. However, Diane's friend Ellen, who is divorcing her husband for infidelity, dares her to examine the contents of Harry's topcoat. She finds a love letter from someone called \"Squirrel\" to her \"passionate lion\". Harry overhears and persuades his best man George to pretend that he took Harry's topcoat by mistake after a party last night and that the letter is actually his. George, who has feelings for Diane himself, reluctantly agrees. Diane is completely fooled ... and begins to see George (whom she thought of as \"dim\") in an entirely different, much more romantic light. Diane learns the truth when Squirrel shows up. She dumps Harry and leaves with George.\nAfterward, Luther and Edgar pawn the topcoat for $10. It eventually ends up with Charles Smith, an unknown classical music composer. A friend arranges a meeting with famed conductor Arturo Bellini, who is impressed with his composition. He is offered the opportunity to conduct the premiere of his work at Carnegie Hall. At the last minute, he is informed he must be properly attired. Elsa hurriedly buys the topcoat for him, but it is a very tight fit. When he conducts, it rips at both shoulders and the audience erupts with laughter. Charles is brought to tears. However, Bellini stands up in his concert box, pointedly removes his own tailcoat and asks him to continue; one by one, the \"gentlemen\" in the audience remove their own tailcoats. After the triumphant performance, Charles donates the topcoat to charity.\nJoe, who runs a mission for the poor, delivers a letter to alcoholic panhandler Larry Browne. It is an invitation to his 25th anniversary college reunion, held at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Joe convinces Larry to attend, hoping it will help him rebuild his life. Larry manages to convince his former classmates that he is successful, even getting a job offer, but one of them, Williams, knows that Larry was a shady lawyer in Chicago who was disbarred. When one man cannot find his wallet, the group hold a mock trial, with Larry as the defendant and Williams as the prosecutor. In the end, Larry ultimately tells everything and leaves. The next morning, however, three of his classmates come to the mission to let him know the job is still his.\nThe topcoat ends up in a second-hand shop, has an adventure with a tale featuring W. C. Fields, Phil Silvers and Margaret Dumont [see below]; where it is stolen by a thief. He wears it to get into an upscale illegal gambling parlor to rob the patrons. In his escape by plane, the jacket catches on fire and the panicked thief throws it out, with $43,000 of loot in the pockets. It lands by Luke and Esther, a poor Black couple. They take it to their minister, and they decide to give it to their congregation to buy whatever they have prayed for. An old farmer tells Luke that the only thing he prayed for is a scarecrow, so Luke gives him the now ragged jacket to make one."

A conman (Fields) buys the jacket from the second-hand store that acquired it from the rescue mission of the fourth tale, thinking that it is stuffed with money from its former owner, who, according to the crooked shop salesman (Silvers), was \"a millionaire\". The conman wears the jacket to a lecture he is to give on abstinence from alcohol at the home of a wealthy woman (Dumont), where the coconut milk served as an alcohol alternative has been spiked with booze by her husband\u2014turning the lecture into a drunken party.\nThe sequence was written primarily by Bert Lawrence, Anne Wigton, William Morrow and Edmund Beloin, with director Mal St. Clair \"advising (Duvivier) on gags and comedy routines for Fields and other comics.\" This tale was fifth in the sequence and was cut when the film was released to reduce running time. It was the easiest to cut without losing continuity, and, ironically, it was by far the funniest. Some sources indicate the \"running time\" was a convenient excuse; others among the cast were unhappy about the Fields sequence taking attention away from the rest of the film.\nThis sequence was discovered in the Fox vaults in the mid-1990s seemingly intact. It was used in Kevin Burns' Hidden Hollywood II: More Treasures from the 20th Century Fox Vaults, a 1997 television documentary spotlighting cut sequences from the studio's films. It was later included as a supplement on the VHS release of the film. The Fox Movie Channel runs the film in its entirety, with all six tales intact and in their intended sequence."

Robinson and Robeson, who was a champion of good film roles for Black actors. Tales of Manhattan was Robeson's final attempt to work within Hollywood, after making only 12 movies and refusing lucrative film offers for over three years. Robeson was deeply disappointed with the sequence, which featured musical numbers by Robeson and the Hall Johnson choir.\nHe initially thought that he and his associates could use the depiction of the plight of the rural Black poor\u2014shown in the film as investing the bulk of their windfall in communal land and tools\u2014to demonstrate a share-and-share-alike way of life. Although he attempted to change some of the film's content during production, in the end he found it \"very offensive to my people. It makes the Negro childlike and innocent and is in the old plantation hallelujah shouter tradition ... the same old story, the Negro singing his way to glory.\" To Robeson, it was a matter of human dignity, and outweighed what he considered his duty to promote communal ownership, inserted into the storyline for Robeson by screenwriter Donald Ogden Stewart, like Robeson a member of the Communist Party USA.\nSome reviewers and black entertainers (including Clarence Muse) noted that the film exposed Blacks' living conditions under the sharecropping system, but Robeson was so dissatisfied that he attempted to buy up all the prints and take the film out of distribution. Following its release, he held a press conference announcing that he would no longer act in Hollywood films because of the demeaning roles available to Black actors. Robeson also said he would gladly picket the film along with others who found the film offensive."

        "content": "The Birth of a Nation, originally called The Clansman, is a 1915 American silent epic drama film directed by D. W. Griffith and starring Lillian Gish. The screenplay is adapted from Thomas Dixon Jr.'s 1905 novel and play The Clansman. Griffith co-wrote the screenplay with Frank E. Woods and produced the film with Harry Aitken.\nThe Birth of a Nation is a landmark of film history, lauded for its technical virtuosity. It was the first non-serial American 12-reel film ever made. Its plot, part fiction and part history, chronicles the assassination of Abraham Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth and the relationship of two families in the Civil War and Reconstruction eras over the course of several years\u2014the pro-Union (Northern) Stonemans and the pro-Confederacy (Southern) Camerons. It was originally shown in two parts separated by an intermission, and it was the first American-made film to have a musical score for an orchestra. It pioneered closeups and fadeouts, and it includes a carefully staged battle sequence with hundreds of extras (another first) made to look like thousands. It came with a 13-page Souvenir Program. It was the first motion picture to be screened inside the White House, viewed there by President Woodrow Wilson, his family, and members of his cabinet.\nThe film was controversial even before its release, and it has remained so ever since; it has been called \"the most controversial film ever made in the United States\":\u200a198\u200a and \"the most reprehensibly racist film in Hollywood history\". The film has been denounced for its racist depiction of African Americans. The film portrays its black characters (many of whom are played by white actors in blackface) as unintelligent and sexually aggressive toward white women. The Ku Klux Klan (KKK) is portrayed as a heroic force, necessary to preserve American values, protect white women, and maintain white supremacy.Popular among white audiences nationwide upon its release, the film's success was both a consequence of and a contributor to racial segregation throughout the U.S. In response to the film's depictions of black people and Civil War history, African Americans across the U.S. organized and protested. In Boston and other localities, black leaders and the NAACP spearheaded an unsuccessful campaign to have it banned on the basis that it inflamed racial tensions and could incite violence. It was also denied release in Chicago, Ohio, Denver, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, and Minneapolis. Griffith's indignation at efforts to censor or ban the film motivated him to produce Intolerance the following year.In spite of its divisiveness, The Birth of a Nation was a massive commercial success across the nation\u2014grossing far more than any previous motion picture\u2014and it profoundly influenced both the film industry and American culture. Adjusted for inflation, the film remains one of the highest-grossing films ever made. It has been acknowledged as an inspiration for the rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan, which took place only a few months after its release. In 1992, the Library of Congress deemed the film \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry."

Jia-Jen, the eldest, is a chemistry teacher who devotes herself to Christianity after facing heartbreak from her college ex-boyfriend. The second daughter, Jia-Chien, is an executive at an airline company. She wanted to become a head chef like her father but he claimed that it was not for a woman. Jia-Ning, the youngest, is a college student who works part-time at a Wendy's fast food restaurant.\nAt dinner, Jia-Chien announces that she has invested in a new apartment and will be moving out once construction is complete. Surprisingly, Mr. Zhu approves. Jia-Chien criticizes the flavor, claiming Mr. Zhu's taste is deteriorating. Mr. Zhu dismisses the idea before suddenly rushing off to help his (and Jia-Chien's) long-time friend and \"taster\", Old Wen, at a banquet. Afterwards, Mr. Zhu wonders with Old Wen if there is anything more to life than eating, drinking, man, and woman. Meanwhile, family friend Jin-Rong stops by the Zhu residence with her daughter Shan-Shan. Jin-Rong vocalizes her difficulties with a messy divorce while being responsible for work, Shan-Shan, and her opinionated mother, Madame Liang, as she returns to Taipei from America. Jia-Jen comforts her while Shan-Shan colors a caricature of Mr. Zhu.\nThe next morning, Mr. Zhu meets Shan-Shan, learns that the lunches Jin-Rong provides her are suboptimal, and decides to cook for her. Shan-Shan agrees, letting Mr. Zhu eat the lunches her mom made to prevent her from discovering their secret. At school, Jia-Jen meets the new volleyball coach Ming-Dao and they take interest in one another. Jia-Chien meets the chief negotiator Li Kai during a meeting at work and they flirt with one another. She has a chance to relocate to Amsterdam due to a potential promotion. Jia-Ning meets up with Guo-Lun, her friend Rachel's on-and-off boyfriend. As Guo-Lun mopes about his unrequited love, Jia-Ning comforts him, telling him that true love is being with someone he can express his feelings to comfortably, leading Guo-Lun to realize his love for Jia-Ning.\nMeanwhile, Old Wen becomes hospitalized. Jia-Jen is fooled by love letters she believes are from Ming-Dao, falling for a prank by her students. Jia-Chien's apartment investment falls through as she discovers that the apartment company went bankrupt and ran away with her savings. She also learns that it was Li Kai who broke Jia-Jen's heart in college and confronts him about it. Li Kai says he never dated Jia-Jen. Jia-Ning faces a dilemma when she begins dating Guo-Lun even after Rachel confesses that she loves him. Mr. Zhu's health deteriorates and secretly visits the hospital, unaware that Jia-Chien saw him while visiting Old Wen. Eventually, Old Wen passes away and Mr. Zhu concludes that his sense of taste has officially departed.\nAt another Sunday feast, Jia-Chien announces that she will no longer be moving out; Mr. Zhu tells her not to worry. Later, Jia-Ning reveals her relationship with Guo-Lun and her pregnancy. The next dinner, Jia-Jen divulges that she and Ming-Dao have eloped. Jia-Jen and Jia-Ning move out of the residence, leaving Mr. Zhu with Jia-Chien. Troubled, Mr. Zhu begins to confide in and meet Madame Liang, leading the daughters to believe that the two are romantically involved.\nWorried about her father's health, Jia-Chien rejects her promotion. Soon, the sisters, their partners, and Jin-Rong's family gather for a large Sunday feast. Mr. Zhu announces his engagement, not to Madame Liang, but to Jin-Rong, also revealing that his visit to the hospital was to show good health to gain Madame Liang's blessing. Madame Liang goes into shock, abruptly ending the dinner. Later, Jia-Ning and Guo-Lun have their baby, Jia-Jen converts Ming-Dao to Christianity, and Mr. Zhu sells the family home and buys a condo with Jin-Rong and Shan-Shan. Jia-Chien, no longer needing to take care of her father, accepts the job in Amsterdam. Before she leaves she prepares a final feast for the family in the family home, but only Mr. Zhu arrives. When Mr. Zhu tastes her cooking he suddenly realizes that his sense of taste has returned.

The banquet becomes a burden on the family.\nThe authors Hong Zhao and Haixin Jin argue in their article \u7834\u574f\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u4f20\u627f\u2014\u2014\u300a\u996e\u98df\u7537\u5973\u300b\u89e3\u8bfb that in the film Eat Drink Man Woman, Zhu\u2019s family first maintains a semblance of calm when everyone represses their desires, then, the family is destructed when members throw off the shackles of their family roles to pursue their own desires. The family structure is eventually reconstructed when everyone\u2019s desire for eat, drink and sex is well balanced. At the beginning of the film, Zhu\u2019s family struggles between maintaining the banquet (eat and drink) and their sexual desire (man and woman). Food is the bond that holds the family together. However, though they dine together every week, they are afraid to confide in each other. When they focus on \u201ceat drink\u201d but suppress sexual desire, the family is unhappy. No one enjoys the meal and Zhu even loses his sense of taste. When Zhu, Jia Jen, and Jia Ning chase after their sexual desires (man and woman), the original family structure disintegrates, but the family becomes happier since everyone gets what they want. The desire for food and sex eventually reach a balance and Zhu\u2019s sense of taste is back at this moment.Each character in this film has their own desire but at the beginning of the film, due to the concern with their family roles, they cannot express themselves."

From the very beginning, Filumena is deeply in love with Domenico, but her love is not reciprocated. After Filumena expresses her wish to be solely his woman, Domenico arranges a leased home for her, with Rosalie as a maid and Alfredo (Aldo Puglisi) as the butler, and arranges a job for her in his shop. He eventually takes her into his house as a semi-official mistress under the pretence that she is the niece of Carmela (his mother's former maid) there to take care of his ailing, senile mother. Domenico's mindset about Filumena's past keeps him from taking their relationship seriously.\nAfter falling for the 20-year-old cashier in his store, Domenico (now 50) plans to marry her. But he finds himself cornered when Filumena feigns illness and, while \"on her deathbed,\" asks him to marry her. Thinking she will be dead in a matter of hours and the marriage won't even be registered, he agrees. After being proclaimed his legal bride, the shrewd and resourceful Filumena drops the charade of feigning death. This sends Domenico into a fit of rage, as he feels that Filumena tricked him for his money. But Filumena reveals the real reason for the marriage: she did it for the three children she had borne (Umberto, Riccardo, and Michele). As the children were coming of age, she wanted them to have Domenico's family name.\nDomenico won't accept this and decides to contest the marriage. The law rules in his favour, and the marriage is annulled. Filumena accepts the annulment but tells Domenico that he had fathered one of the children. She does not say which one, as she considers all of them equal. However, she gives him a hint that his child was conceived on the night Domenico had said \"to pretend we are in love\" and had given her a 100-lira note, on which she had written the date and kept it in a locket ever since. She gives the note to Domenico, having torn off the corner containing the date. Domenico is visibly rattled by this revelation but can't solve the clue.\nDomenico tries desperately to figure out which child he had fathered. He visits the children at their workplaces and tries other means but hits a dead end.\nHe meets up with Filumena and tries to force an answer out of her, but she reveals nothing more. As a last resort, Domenico decides to confront the children directly, but Filumena vehemently opposes this, as the prospect of Domenico's money would drive a wedge between the children. As Filumena and Domenico scuffle, they tumble down, fall into each other's arms, and passionately kiss. They then declare their love for each other and decide to (re)marry.\nAt the church, the boys wait, and Domenico arrives. Domenico mentions that, because he will be marrying their mother, he will give them his name. He continues to prod them for clues but again comes out with nothing, as they each share some of his traits. Filumena rushes in; Domenico, smiling with joy, tells her how wonderful she looks, and the marriage takes place.\nBack at home, the boys bid their mother goodnight. As, one after another, they say goodnight to Domenico calling him their father, he smiles broadly and says that he will see them tomorrow.\nFilumena sits and weeps with joy at this. When Domenico asks why she is crying, she states that it feels wonderful to cry."

        "content": "Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a 1977 American science fiction drama film written and directed by Steven Spielberg, starring Richard Dreyfuss, Melinda Dillon, Teri Garr, Bob Balaban, Cary Guffey, and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut. It is the story of Roy Neary, an everyday blue-collar worker in Indiana, whose life changes after an encounter with a UFO.\nClose Encounters was a long-cherished project for Spielberg. In late 1973, he developed a deal with Columbia Pictures for a science-fiction film. Though Spielberg received sole credit for the script, he was assisted by Paul Schrader, John Hill, David Giler, Hal Barwood, Matthew Robbins, and Jerry Belson, all of whom contributed to the screenplay in varying degrees. The title is derived from Ufologist J. Allen Hynek's classification of close encounters with extraterrestrials, in which the third kind denotes human observations of extraterrestrials or \"animate beings\". Douglas Trumbull served as the visual effects supervisor, while Carlo Rambaldi designed the extraterrestrials.\nMade on a production budget of US$19.4 million, Close Encounters was released in a limited number of cities on November 16 and 23, 1977, and expanded into wide release the following month. It was a critical and financial success, eventually grossing over $300 million worldwide. It received numerous awards and nominations at the 50th Academy Awards, 32nd British Academy Film Awards, the 35th Golden Globe Awards and the 5th Saturn Awards, and has been widely acclaimed by the American Film Institute.\nIn December 2007, it was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. A Special Edition was released theatrically in 1980, featuring shortened scenes and additional scenes. Spielberg agreed to create this edition to add more scenes that they had been unable to include in the original release, with the studio demanding a controversial scene depicting the interior of the extraterrestrial mothership. Spielberg's dissatisfaction with the altered ending scene led to a third version, the Director's Cut on VHS and LaserDisc in 1998 (and later DVD and Blu-ray). It is the longest version, combining Spielberg's favorite elements from both previous editions but removing the scenes inside the mothership. The film was later remastered in 4K and was then re-released in theaters in 2017 for its 40th anniversary."

The planes are in perfect condition, but without any occupants. An elderly witness nearby claims \"the sun came out at night, and sang to him\".  Near Indianapolis, air traffic controllers watch two airline flights narrowly avoid a mid-air collision with a UFO.\nAt a rural home outside Muncie, Indiana, three-year-old Barry Guiler wakes to find his toys operating on their own. He starts to follow something outside, forcing his mother, Jillian, to chase after him. Large-scale power outages begin rolling through the area, forcing electrician Roy Neary  to investigate. While he gets his bearings, Roy experiences a close encounter with a UFO, and when it flies over his truck, it lightly burns the side of his face with its lights. The UFO takes off with three others in the sky, as Roy and three police cars give chase. The spacecraft fly off into the night sky but the metaphysical experience leaves Roy mesmerized.\nThe researchers are similarly baffled to find the SS Cotopaxi in the middle of the Gobi Desert, intact and completely empty.\nRoy becomes fascinated by UFOs to the dismay of his wife, Ronnie. He obsesses over subliminal images of a mountain shape, often making models of it. Jillian, meanwhile also becomes obsessed, sketching the unique mountain image. Soon after, she is terrorized in her home by a UFO which descends from the clouds. She fights off violent attempts by the UFO and unseen beings to enter the home, but in the chaos, Barry is abducted.\nLacombe, Laughlin, and a group of United Nations experts continue to investigate increasing UFO activity and strange, related occurrences. Witnesses in Dharamsala, Northern India report that the UFOs make distinctive sounds: a five-tone musical phrase in a pentatonic scale. Scientists broadcast the phrase to outer space, but are mystified by the response, a seemingly meaningless series of numbers (104 44 30 40 36 10) repeated until Laughlin, with his background in cartography, recognizes it as a set of geographical coordinates, which point to Devils Tower near Moorcroft, Wyoming. Lacombe and the U.S. military converge on Wyoming. The United States Army evacuates the area, planting false reports in the media that a train wreck has spilled a toxic nerve gas, while actually preparing a secret landing zone for the UFOs and their occupants.\nMeanwhile, Roy's increasingly eccentric behavior causes Ronnie to abandon him, taking their three children with her. When a news program about a supposed train wreck near Devils Tower airs on television, Roy and Jillian recognize the same mountain they have been visualizing. They, along with other travelers experiencing similar visions, set out for Devils Tower in spite of the public warnings about toxic gas.\nMost of the travelers are apprehended by the Army, but Roy and Jillian reach the site just as UFOs appear in the night sky. The government specialists at the site begin to communicate with the UFOs, which gradually appear by the dozens, by using light and sound on a large electrical billboard. An enormous mothership lands to release many abductees from different eras: World War II pilots, Cotopaxi sailors, adults, children, and animals. Barry also returns and reunites with Jillian. The government officials hastily prepare Roy for inclusion in its select group of potential visitors to the mothership.\nAs the extraterrestrials finally emerge from the mothership, they select Roy to join their travels. As Roy enters the mothership, one of the extraterrestrials pauses for a few moments with the humans. Lacombe uses Curwen hand signs that correspond to the five-note extraterrestrial tonal phrase. The extraterrestrial replies with the same gestures, smiles, and returns to its ship, which takes to the sky."

Williams wrote more than 300 examples of the iconic five-tone motif, to be used by scientists to communicate with the visiting spaceship as a mathematical language, before Spielberg chose the one incorporated into the film's signature theme. Spielberg called Williams's work \"When You Wish Upon a Star meets science fiction\". Incidentally, Williams briefly included the signature melody into the score at Spielberg's behest, just before Roy Neary turns to board the mothership. The synthesizer playing the five notes is an ARP 2500. Vice President of Engineering at ARP Instruments, Phillip Dodds, was sent to install the unit on the film set and was subsequently cast as Jean Claude, the musician who plays the sequence on the huge synthesizer in an attempt to communicate with the extraterrestrial mothership. Spielberg initially included Cliff Edwards's original \"When You Wish upon a Star\" from Pinocchio in the closing credits, but after a Dallas preview where several members of the audience audibly snickered at the inclusion, the song was dropped and replaced with Williams's orchestral version. It is in the special edition of the end titles on the 1998 Collector's Edition of the soundtrack.The score was recorded at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. Williams was nominated for two Academy Awards in 1978, one for his score to Star Wars and one for his score to Close Encounters. He won for Star Wars, though he later won two Grammy Awards in 1979 for his Close Encounters score (one for Best Original Film Score and one for Best Instrumental Composition for \"Theme from Close Encounters\")."

        "content": "Film critic Charlene Engel observed that Close Encounters \"suggests that humankind has reached the point where it is ready to enter the community of the cosmos. While it is a computer which makes the final musical conversation with the extraterrestrial guests possible, the characteristics bringing Neary to make his way to Devils Tower have little to do with technical expertise or computer literacy. These are virtues taught in schools that will be evolved in the 21st century.\" The film also evokes typical science fiction archetypes and motifs. The film portrays new technologies as a natural and expected outcome of human development and indication of health and growth.Other critics found a variety of Judeo-Christian analogies. Devils Tower parallels Mount Sinai, the extraterrestrials as God, and Roy Neary as Moses. Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments is on television at the Neary household. Some found close relations between Elijah and Roy; Elijah was taken into a \"chariot of fire\", akin to Roy boarding the UFO. Climbing Devils Tower behind the faltering Jillian, Roy exhorts Jillian to keep moving and not to look back, a contrast to Lot's wife, who looked back at Sodom and turned into a pillar of salt. Spielberg explained, \"I wanted to make Close Encounters a very accessible story about the everyday individual who has a sighting that overturns his life, and throws it into complete upheaval as he starts to become more and more obsessed with this experience.\"Roy's wife Ronnie attempts to hide the sunburn caused by Roy's exposure to the UFOs and wants him to forget his encounter with them. She is embarrassed and bewildered by what has happened to him and desperately wants her ordinary life back. The expression of his lost life is seen when he is sculpting a huge model of Devils Tower in his living room, with his family deserting him. Roy's obsession with an idea implanted by an extraterrestrial intelligence, his construction of the model, and his gradual loss of contact with his wife, mimic the events in the short story \"Dulcie and Decorum\" (1955) by Damon Knight.Close Encounters studies the form of \"youth spiritual yearning\". Barry Guiler, the unfearing child who refers to the UFOs and their paraphernalia as \"toys\" (although that was unscripted, with the child being drawn to smile by being shown toys offstage), serves as a motif for childlike innocence and openness in the face of the unknown. Spielberg also compared the theme of communication as highlighting that of tolerance: \"If we can talk to extraterrestrials in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, why not with the Reds in the Cold War?\" Sleeping is the final obstacle to overcome in the ascent of Devils Tower. Roy, Jillian, and a third invitee, Larry Butler, climb the mountain pursued by government helicopters spraying sleeping gas. Larry stops to rest, is gassed, and falls into a deep sleep.In his interview with Spielberg on Inside the Actors Studio, James Lipton suggested Close Encounters has another, more personal theme for Spielberg: \"Your father was a computer engineer; your mother was a concert pianist, and when the spaceship lands, they make music together on the computer\", suggesting that Roy Neary's boarding the spaceship represents Spielberg's wish to be reunited with his parents. The director had not consciously intended this aspect. In a 2005 interview, Spielberg stated that he made Close Encounters when he did not have children, and if he were making it today, he would never have had Roy leave his family and board the mothership.Communication and language issues constitute additional themes as noted by Andrew Johnston in Time Out New York: \"Throughout the film, there are many scenes that anticipate themes Spielberg would explore in subsequent projects, but his execution of these ideas here is usually more interesting and subtle. In Amistad, for example, he devotes much time to illustrating the language barrier separating Africans from both their captors and their potential saviors. It's an essential plot point, but it's so belabored that the story gets bogged down. In CE3K, the language problem is illustrated concisely by a quick scene in which an interpreter translates Spanish into English for Laughlin so he can turn around and translate it into French for Lacombe. Since Spielberg doesn't ram the language problem down our throats, the extraterrestrials' solution\u2014using music to communicate with humanity\u2014seems more elegant and natural.\""

In 1985, Spielberg donated $100,000 to the Planetary Society for Megachannel ExtraTerrestrial Assay.Shortly after the film's release in late 1977, Spielberg considered either a sequel or prequel, but decided against it. He explained, \"The army's knowledge and ensuing cover-up is so subterranean that it would take a creative screen story, perhaps someone else making the picture and giving it the equal time it deserves.\"When asked in 1980 to select a single \"master image\" that summed up his film career, Spielberg chose the shot of Barry opening his living room door to see the blazing orange light from the UFO. \"That was beautiful but awful light, just like fire coming through the doorway. [Barry's] very small, and it's a very large door, and there's a lot of promise or danger outside that door.\" In 2007, Close Encounters was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and was added to the National Film Registry for preservation.

        "content": "The Godfather is a 1972 American epic crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who co-wrote the screenplay with Mario Puzo, based on Puzo's best-selling 1969 novel of the same title. The ensemble cast includes Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, and Diane Keaton. It is the first installment in The Godfather trilogy,  chronicling the Corleone family under patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando) from 1945 to 1955. It focuses on the transformation of his youngest son, Michael Corleone (Pacino), from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss.\nParamount Pictures obtained the rights to the novel for $80,000, before it gained popularity. Studio executives had trouble finding a director; the first few candidates turned down the position before Coppola signed on to direct the film but disagreement followed over casting several characters, in particular, Vito (Marlon Brando) and Michael (Al Pacino). Filming took place primarily on location around New York City and in Sicily, and was completed ahead of schedule. The musical score was composed principally by Nino Rota, with additional pieces by Carmine Coppola.\nThe Godfather premiered at the Loew's State Theatre on March 14, 1972, and was widely released in the United States on March 24, 1972. It was the highest-grossing film of 1972, and was for a time the highest-grossing film ever made, earning between $250 and $291 million at the box office. The film was acclaimed by critics and audiences, who praised its performances\u2014particularly those of Brando and Pacino\u2014direction, screenplay, writing, story, cinematography, editing, score, and portrayal of the mafia. The Godfather launched the successful careers of Coppola, Pacino, and other relative newcomers in the cast and crew. At the 45th Academy Awards, the film won Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay (for Puzo and Coppola). In addition, the seven other Oscar nominations included Pacino, Caan, and Duvall all for Best Supporting Actor, and Coppola for Best Director.\nThe Godfather is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, as well as a landmark of the gangster genre. It was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1990, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and is ranked the second-greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute. It was followed by sequels The Godfather Part II (1974) and The Godfather Part III (1990). Pauline Kael wrote that \"If ever there was a great example of how the best popular movies come out of a merger of commerce and art, The Godfather is it.\""

        "content": "In 1945, the New York City Corleone family don, Vito Corleone, listens to requests during his daughter Connie's wedding to Carlo. Vito's youngest son Michael, a Marine who has thus far stayed out of the family business, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a popular singer and Vito's godson, seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role. Vito sends his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to persuade studio president Jack Woltz to offer Johnny the part. Woltz refuses Hagen's request at first, but soon complies after finding the severed head of his prized stud horse in his bed.\nAs Christmas approaches, drug baron Sollozzo asks Vito to invest in his narcotics business and for police protection. Vito declines, citing that involvement in narcotics would alienate his political connections. Suspicious of Sollozzo's partnership with the Tattaglia crime family, Vito sends his enforcer Luca Brasi to the Tattaglias on an espionage mission. Brasi is garroted to death during the initial meeting. Later, enforcers gun down Vito and coerce Hagen into a meeting. With Vito's first-born Sonny now in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept the narcotics deal. Vito survives the shooting and is visited in the hospital by Michael, who finds him unprotected after NYPD officers on Sollozzo's payroll cleared out Vito's guards. Michael thwarts the attempt on his father's life but is beaten by corrupt police captain Mark McCluskey. After the attempted hit at the hospital, Sonny retaliates with a hit on Bruno Tattaglia. Sollozzo and McCluskey request to meet with Michael and settle the dispute. Michael feigns interest and agrees to meet, but hatches a plan with Sonny and Corleone capo Clemenza to kill them and go into hiding. Michael meets Sollozzo and McCluskey at a Bronx restaurant; after retrieving a handgun planted in the bathroom by Clemenza, he shoots both men dead.\nDespite a clampdown by the authorities for the killing of a police captain, the Five Families erupt in open warfare. Michael takes refuge in Sicily and Fredo, Vito's second son, is sheltered by Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny publicly attacks and threatens Carlo for physically abusing Connie. When he abuses her again, Sonny speeds to their home but is ambushed and murdered by gangsters at a highway toll booth. In Sicily, Michael meets and marries a local woman, Apollonia, but she is killed shortly thereafter by a car bomb intended for him.\nDevastated by Sonny's death and tired of war, Vito sets a meeting with the Five Families. He assures them that he will withdraw his opposition to their narcotics business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay. Kay gives birth to two children in the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo not suited to lead, Michael assumes the position of head of the Corleone family. Vito reveals to Michael that it was Don Barzini who ordered the hit on Sonny and warns him that Barzini would try to kill him at a meeting organized by a traitorous Corleone capo. With Vito's support, Michael relegates Hagen to managing operations in Las Vegas as he is not a \"wartime consigliere\". Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos and is dismayed to see that Fredo is more loyal to Greene than to his own family.\nIn 1955, Vito dies of a heart attack while playing with Michael's son Anthony. At Vito's funeral, Tessio asks Michael to meet with Barzini, signaling his betrayal. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone hitmen murder the dons of the Five Families, plus Greene, and Tessio is executed for his treachery. Michael extracts Carlo's confession to playing a part in Sonny's murder. He assures Carlo that he is being exiled, not murdered, before Clemenza strangles Carlo. Connie confronts Michael about his involvement in Carlo's death while Kay is in the room. Kay asks Michael if she is telling the truth and is relieved when he denies carrying out the death. As she leaves, capos enter the office and pay reverence to Michael as \"Don Corleone\"."

For the score, Rota was to relate to the situations and characters in the film. Rota synthesized new music for the film and took some parts from his 1958 Fortunella film score, in order to create an Italian feel and evoke the tragedy within the film. Paramount executive Evans found the score to be too \"highbrow\" and did not want to use it; however, it was used after Coppola managed to get Evans to agree. Coppola believed that Rota's musical piece gave the film even more of an Italian feel. Coppola's father, Carmine, created some additional music for the film, particularly the music played by the band during the opening wedding scene.Incidental music includes \"C'\u00e8 la luna mezzo mare\" and Cherubino's aria, \"Non so pi\u00f9 cosa son\", from Le Nozze di Figaro. There was a soundtrack released for the film in 1972 in vinyl form by Paramount Records, on CD in 1991 by Geffen Records, and digitally by Geffen on August 18, 2005. The album contains over 31 minutes of music that was used in the film, most of which was composed by Rota, along with a song from Coppola and one by Johnny Farrow and Marty Symes. AllMusic gave the album five out of five, with editor Zach Curd saying it is a \"dark, looming, and elegant soundtrack\". An editor for Filmtracks believed that Rota was successful in relating the music to the film's core aspects."

        "content": "Although many films about gangsters preceded The Godfather, Coppola steeped his film in Italian immigrant culture, and his portrayal of mobsters as persons of considerable psychological depth and complexity was unprecedented. Coppola took it further with The Godfather Part II, and the success of those two films, critically, artistically and financially, was a catalyst for the production of numerous other depictions of Italian Americans as mobsters, including films such as Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas and TV series such as David Chase's The Sopranos.\nA comprehensive study of Italian-American culture in film from 1914 to 2014 was conducted by the Italic Institute of America showing the influence of The Godfather. Over 81 percent of films, 430 films, featuring Italian Americans as mobsters (87 percent of which were fictional) had been produced since The Godfather, an average of 10 per year, while only 98 films were produced preceding The Godfather.\nThe Godfather epic, encompassing the original trilogy and the additional footage that Coppola incorporated later, has been thoroughly integrated into American life. Together with a succession of mob-theme imitators, it has resulted in a stereotyped concept of Italian-American culture biased toward the criminal networks. The first film had the largest effect. Unlike any film before it, its portrayal of the many poor Italians who immigrated to the United States in the early decades of the 20th century is perhaps attributable to Coppola and expresses his understanding of their experience. The films explore the integration of fictional Italian-American criminals into American society. Though set in the period of mass Italian immigration to America, the film explores the specific family of the Corleones, who live outside the law. Although some critics have considered the Corleone story to portray some universal elements of immigration, other critics have suggested that it resulted in viewers overly associating organized crime with Italian-American culture. Produced in a period of intense national cynicism and self-criticism, the film struck a chord about the dual identities felt by many descendants of immigrants. The Godfather has been cited as an influence in an increase in Hollywood's negative portrayals of immigrant Italians, and was a recruiting tool for organized crime.The concept of a mafia \"Godfather\" was a creation of Mario Puzo, and the film resulted in this term being added to the common language. Don Vito Corleone's line, \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse\", was voted the second-most memorable line in cinema history in AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes by the American Film Institute, in 2014. The concept was not unique to the film. French writer Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, in his novel Le P\u00e8re Goriot (1835), wrote that Vautrin told Eug\u00e8ne: \"In that case I will make you an offer that no one would decline.\" An almost identical line was used in the John Wayne Western, Riders of Destiny (1933), where Forrest Taylor states, \"I've made Denton an offer he can't refuse.\" In 2014, the film also was selected as the greatest film by 2,120 industry professionals in a Hollywood survey undertaken by The Hollywood Reporter.Gangsters reportedly responded enthusiastically to the film. Salvatore \"Sammy the Bull\" Gravano, the former underboss in the Gambino crime family, said: \"I left the movie stunned ... I mean I floated out of the theater. Maybe it was fiction, but for me, then, that was our life. It was incredible. I remember talking to a multitude of guys, made guys, who felt exactly the same way.\" According to Anthony Fiato, after seeing the film, Patriarca crime family members Paulie Intiso and Nicky Giso altered their speech patterns to imitate that of Vito Corleone. Intiso was known to swear frequently and use poor grammar; but after seeing the movie, he began to improve his speech and philosophize more."

For instance, in the season 3 episode \"Lisa's Pony\", Lisa wakes up to find a horse in her bed and starts screaming, a reference to Jack finding his prize racehorse's head in his bed. In the season 4 episode \"Mr. Plow\", Bart Simpson is pelted with snowballs in mimicry of Sonny's killing.\nThe film's baptism sequence was parodied in \"Fulgencio\", the 13th episode of season 4 of the comedy series Modern Family, with Phil Dunphy standing in for Michael. The sequence also references the horse head scene when Phil's son Luke places a severed zebra head in the bed of a boy who had been making fun of him and had a fear of zebras. Phil also references Godfather lines when he tells his wife Claire, \"Don't ask me about my business,\" and mentions an offer he can't refuse.\nThe 2006 video game The Godfather is based upon this film and tells the story of an original character, Aldo Trapani, whose rise through the ranks of the Corleone family intersects with the plot of the film on numerous occasions. Duvall, Caan, and Brando supplied voiceovers and their likenesses, but Pacino did not. Francis Ford Coppola openly voiced his disapproval of the game.\nOn April 28, 2022, a 10-episode drama series The Offer premiered on Paramount+, about the production told from the perspective of producer Ruddy.\nAn episode of the animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants entitled \"The Goobfather\" from the 13th season has many scenes that directly parody this film.\nThe 2023 film Barbie, directed by Greta Gerwig, features a scene in which the characters watch The Godfather, with Ken, portrayed by Kingsley Ben-Adir, praising the film as a collective effort of Francis Ford Coppola and Robert Evans.

An arrogant barbarian fighter, Cord, defeats every opponent, but he is disqualified for fighting dishonorably. Cord decides to follow the eventual winner, Morthond, hoping that he can lead Cord to Zetan.\nWhile the two fighters are resting, a blind flutist walks by them and into a nearby building. Cord follows the blind man and sees him easily dispatch a gang of thugs who attack him. Impressed by his fighting skills, Cord asks the blind man to be his teacher. The blind man refuses, but Cord follows him anyway. Cord becomes frustrated with the way the blind man teaches his lessons in riddles, after which the blind man disappears.\nCord finds Morthond wounded from the first trial. Morthond asks Cord to help him end his suffering and pursue his quest to find Zetan. Cord does, and he faces a tribe of monkey men whose leader, the Monkeyman, is a great fighter. Cord challenges and eventually overcomes the Monkeyman, who then tells him how to find his second trial.\nOn the way, Cord encounters a man in a large cauldron of oil who is attempting to dissolve the lower half of his body. The man is hoping to end his sexual urges to find enlightenment. He invites Cord to join him in the cauldron, but Cord refuses, and the man warns him that Cord will eventually break his own vow of celibacy.\nCord then comes upon a band of travelers holding a festival. Cord meets with their leader, Chang-Sha, who offers to let Cord sleep with one of his wives, Tara. Cord declines due to his vow and instead challenges Chang-Sha to combat. The contest is set for the following day, as Chang-Sha has already agreed to fight a muscle-bound African warrior. Chang-Sha defeats the African, killing him. During the night, Cord is joined in his tent by Tara and they make love. Cord, enthralled with her, asks Tara to stay with him forever. The next morning when Cord awakes, he finds that the entire band has left, and that Tara has been crucified, enraging Cord. \nResuming his journey, Cord has a vision of Death, but he dispels the spirit by demonstrating his lack of fear.\nWhile trying to find Chang-Sha, Cord reaches an oasis, where he again meets the blind man. Cord again asks him to be his teacher; the blind man agrees, and they travel together. Encounters with a poor ferryman couple, a band of raiders and a spoiled child become opportunities for the blind man to teach an exasperated Cord a few life lessons before they go their separate ways once again.\nCord finally finds Chang-Sha and his band. Cord now holds himself responsible for Tara's death, but he insists on fighting Chang-Sha to learn the location of Zetan. After pummeling each other for several minutes the fight ends in a draw, but Chang-Sha tells Cord how to find Zetan anyway. \nCord reaches the island where Zetan lives. He encounters Zetan and the sect that protects the book of enlightenment. Cord expects to fight, but Zetan explains that Cord has passed the trials and is entitled to read the book. He even asks Cord to replace him as the new keeper of the book. Opening it, Cord finds that the book's pages are simply mirrors. Zetan explains that there is no book of wisdom, and that enlightenment is found only in oneself. Cord walks off laughing, declining to take the frustrated Zetan's place, and leaves the island. Having found a measure of peace in  his life, Cord rejoins the blind man who passes on his flute to him, indicating that Cord will now take on the role of teacher."

Heidi (a hippopotamus), the star, is insulted by pornographic director Trevor (a rat) and complains to her boss and lover, Bletch (a walrus), who is actually in an adulterous relationship with Samantha (a Siamese cat). Meanwhile, Robert (a hedgehog), the newest member of the team, arrives at the theatre, where he is accosted by reporter F. W. Fly (a fly), who tries to corrupt Robert into informing on the cast, meets Arthur (a worm), the show's manager, and immediately falls in love with another newcomer, Lucille (a female dog). Trevor is approached by sniveling drug-addicted knife thrower Wynyard (a frog) looking for his fix, but the drugs have not yet been delivered. Guppy (a fish) auditions for The Feebles backstage, only to get eaten by Bletch. After Heidi finishes jogging, Samantha confronts her, insults her, and reveals her relationship with Bletch, resulting in a fight between the two, in which Heidi throws her in a cardboard box. With the help of Arthur, Robert is able to serenade Lucille, confessing his love to her, and the two become engaged. \nAfter his tribble-like creatures accidentally get crushed by a barrel, animal tamer Sid (an elephant), and Arthur have a beer, when he receives a visit from his ex-girlfriend, showgirl Sandy (a chicken) with his alleged son Seymour the Elechicken (an improbable-looking elephant/chicken hybrid). Sandy informs him she will be preparing a paternity case against him. Bletch and Barry (a bulldog) consummate a drug deal with Cedric (a warthog), during which Bletch and Cedric deliberately sabotage each other during a game of golf, which ends with Bletch winning by throwing up the chewed remains of Guppy. \nBack at the theater, Dennis (an aardvark) is shown peeping on the second most important star of the show, Harry (a rabbit) in a threesome with two female rabbits. Trevor is shooting a porn film in the basement with the Masked Masochist (a weta) and Madam Bovine (a cow). They are interrupted by Robert, who mistakes the scene for torture and tries to save Bovine, who in turn accidentally crushes the Masked Masochist, suffocating him. Trevor later feeds him to a fish-like monster.\nThe director of the show, Sebastian (a red fox), lambasts Robert for failing his part as an extra on the stage. As punishment, he assigns Robert the task of replacing Wynyard's assistant, who has just been killed by Wynyard's knife throwing while going through drug withdrawal. At the toilet, Harry is suffering from a mystery illness and F. W. Fly harasses him. Wynyard tells Robert his story of Vietnam, and convinces Robert to give him $50 to buy drugs from Trevor. After seeing Trevor's latest porno film starring Dennis (who Trevor chose for a substitute) and Madame Bovine, Bletch decides they need a new porn star, and Trevor chooses Lucille. Harry passes out down some stairs, much to the surprise of fellow cast member Dorothy (a sheep), who yells for help. Dr. Quack (a duck) gives Harry only twelve hours to live, both unaware of F. W. Fly spying on them from the ceiling above. \nElsewhere, Abi (a human), the show's contortionist, accidentally manages to roll himself into a ball during rehearsal. Not happy with how the show is turning out, Sebastian demands for his song to be included, only to be turned down and thrown out by Bletch.\nF. W. Fly continually harasses Harry, ultimately reporting his illness to the tabloids. Trevor drugs Lucille and tries to rape her as an audition, but is caught by Robert. When he walks in on the scene, Robert thinks that Lucille was drinking and throwing herself at Trevor, and disowns her. After an awful rehearsal, Sebastian lambasts Heidi, causing her to rush to Bletch for emotional affirmation, but walks in on Samantha performing oral sex on him. That night, after testing the drugs provided by Cedric on Dennis, the drugs turn out to be borax, infuriating Bletch. Cedric's agent Louie (a dog) is literally liquefied after being force-fed some of the borax by Bletch's henchmen. \nHeidi locks herself in her room, throws a tantrum, and refuses to perform, but relents after Bletch has make-up sex with her. Soon after, Bletch and his cronies venture to the docklands to fight Cedric and his crab-crewmen. Bletch's side prevails after killing Cedric and the crabs, as well as a giant spider helping to move crates, which bites off Barry's head, and Cedric's boss, Mr. Big (a sperm whale), by driving through his digestive system and coming out his anus. After seeing the article of Harry's illness in the newspaper, The Speculator, Bletch decides to retaliate, presumably wanting to avoid negative press on the cast. Lucille tries to convince Robert of her love for him, but he tells her he never wants to see her again. Trevor lures F. W. Fly into the bathroom, where Bletch tears his wings off and flushes him down the toilet. Shortly afterwards, Heidi attempts to seduce Bletch in his office, but Bletch confesses to Heidi that he actually hates her and wants to give the main role to Samantha. This causes Heidi to mentally break down, and envisions the rest of the Feebles laughing at her.\nLater, things begin to go awry during the performance. An ailing Harry winds up vomiting all over the stage during his performance, Sid is accosted by Sandy in the midst of his act, which causes it to fall apart, Wynyard accidentally kills himself during his act when he loses his grip on one of his knives and it comes down on his head, and Sebastian decides to take matters into his own hands. After a failed attempt at hanging herself, Heidi then tries to commit suicide with an M60 machine gun, but at that second, Samantha walks into the room and taunts Heidi upon seeing her about to end her life. Heidi snaps, turns the gun on Samantha, and shoots her dead. Sebastian, in a poor and desperate attempt to save the show, puts on a musical number about the act of \"Sodomy\", disgusting the silent and unamused live audience, much to the horror of Bletch, who orders Trevor to kill him. As he does so, Heidi then goes on a shooting spree, killing many of the cast, including Harry (who was told by Dr. Quack that he was going to recover as he only has \"bunny pox\"), Abi (who finally managed to free his head only to be crushed by his bedded nails), Dorothy (who attempted to talk to Heidi), and others.\nAt the end of the show, Heidi continues her shooting spree, and Sid braves the crazed Heidi's automatic fire to save his son, after Sandy gets her head shot off. Sebastian hides in Harry\u2019s giant carrot-rocket, and is injured when Heidi causes it to go off and crash into a wall. Robert rescues Lucille from being shot and professes that he still loves her, and Lucille tells him the truth about Trevor's attempted raping of her. After Heidi kills every other Feeble on stage, Bletch attempts to talk Heidi into surrendering, but Heidi opens fire on him and he drops from the balcony. Lying injured on the stage, Bletch convinces Heidi to stop her rampage by proclaiming he still loves her, only for Trevor to shoot her in the shoulder from behind with a shotgun.\nBletch, having tricked Heidi into letting her guard down, orders Trevor to kill her, only for Robert to intervene by swinging on a rope from the rafters and colliding with Trevor, incapacitating Trevor briefly enough for Heidi to reclaim the machine gun and shoot him dead. Bletch lunges at Heidi in a last ditch effort, but is killed too. From backstage, Arthur tells Heidi that he regrettably had to tip off the police about Heidi's shooting rampage. Heidi accepts this and makes one last request before her impending incarceration - to play her musical number, \"Garden of Love\", to which Arthur complies.\nThe epilogue reveals the fates of only seven survivors: Sid gets extensive repair on his kneecaps after being accidentally shot by Heidi in her rampage and works in an orchard as a struggling horticulturist with his son Seymour. Arthur received an OBE for his lifelong service at the theater and retires to the country. Sebastian recovers from his injuries and became a successful writer who achieved worldwide fame for his best seller, The Feeble Variety Massacre: One Man's Act of Heroism!, and is currently negotiating film rights. Robert (now an award-winning fashion photographer for a women's magazine) and Lucille are married with two children. Finally, Heidi, whose killing spree resulted in her imprisonment in a women's penitentiary for ten years, has been rehabilitated into the community and now works under a new identity on the check-out counter of a large supermarket."

        "content": "The film was originally conceived as part of a television series, and only belatedly became a feature after Japanese investors proposed expanding it; as such, the script was hastily re-written. The dialogue was recorded before shooting began. Made on an extremely low budget considering the time-consuming process of working with puppets, the film went over budget and schedule. The feature was filmed in Wellington, with the majority of the scenes being filmed on multiple constructed sets places, in an abandoned railway shed (Shed No. 12 to be exact) at the dockyards. Some scenes were filmed outside the goods shed, such as a few external and internal scenes that were filmed at The St. James Theatre. During filming, some scenes, including the Vietnam flashback, were funded by members of the film crew, and filmed secretly under the title Frogs of War. The Vietnam flashback includes a game of Russian roulette as a parody of The Deer Hunter. An initial application for Film Commission money was rejected by executive director Jim Booth, who a short time later became Jackson's producer. The Commission eventually granted the production two-thirds of its $750,000 budget, though relationships between the funders and the production soured and the Film Commission removed its credit from the film. \nIt is often mistakenly stated that there are no human characters in the film; the character Abi is a human. However, there are no real-life human characters in the film. Director Jackson has a cameo as an audience member dressed as an alien from Bad Taste. Every vehicle seen in the film is a variation on the Morris Minor, including a specially constructed limousine. Morris Minors also appear in Jackson's Bad Taste and Braindead. By presumed coincidence, one of the characters, Harry the Hare, shares a name with the title character of James B. Hemesath's short story \"Harry the Hare\" (himself a Bugs Bunny pastiche), written for Harlan Ellison's anthology Again, Dangerous Visions in 1972."

        "content": "It's a Wonderful Life is a 1946 American Christmas supernatural drama film produced and directed by Frank Capra. It is based on the short story and booklet \"The Greatest Gift\" self-published by Philip Van Doren Stern in 1943, which itself is loosely based on the 1843 Charles Dickens novella A Christmas Carol. The film stars James Stewart as George Bailey, a man who has given up his personal dreams in order to help others in his community and whose thoughts of suicide on Christmas Eve bring about the intervention of his guardian angel, Clarence Odbody. Clarence shows George all the lives he touched and what the world would be like if he had not existed.\nAlthough it was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture,  It's a Wonderful Life initially received mixed reviews and was unsuccessful at the box office. Theatrically, the film's break-even point was $6.3 million, about twice the production cost, a figure it did not come close to achieving on its initial release. Because of the film's disappointing sales, Capra was seen by some studios as having lost his ability to produce popular, financially successful films. Its copyright expired in 1974 following a lack of renewal and it entered the public domain, allowing it to be broadcast without licensing or royalty fees at which point it became a Christmas classic.It's a Wonderful Life is now considered to be one of the greatest films of all time and among the best Christmas films. It has been recognized by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 best American films ever made. It was No. 11 on the American Film Institute's 1998 greatest movie list, No. 20 on its 2007 greatest movie list, No. 8 on its list of greatest love stories, and No. 1 on its list of the most inspirational American films of all time. In 1990, It's a Wonderful Life was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being deemed as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".  Capra revealed that it was his favorite among the films he directed and that he screened it for his family every Christmas season. It was one of Stewart's favorite films.A modern remake of the film, written and directed by Kenya Barris, is in development at Paramount Pictures as of January 2024."

The prayers of his family and friends reach Heaven, where guardian angel second class Clarence Odbody is assigned to save George in order to earn his wings. Clarence is shown flashbacks of George's life. He watches 12-year-old George rescue his younger brother Harry from drowning, leaving George deaf in his left ear. George later saves the pharmacist, Mr. Gower, from accidentally poisoning a customer.\nIn 1928, George plans a world tour before college. He is reintroduced to Mary Hatch, who has loved him since childhood. When his father dies from a sudden stroke, George postpones his travel to settle the family business, Bailey Brothers Building and Loan. Avaricious board member Henry Potter, who owns the bank and most of the town, seeks to dissolve the company, but the board of directors votes to keep it open on condition that George run it. George acquiesces and works alongside his uncle Billy, giving his tuition savings to his younger brother Harry with the understanding that Harry will take over when he graduates.\nHowever, Harry returns from college married and with a job offer from his father-in-law, and George resigns himself to running the building and loan. George and Mary rekindle their relationship and marry, and use their honeymoon savings to keep the company solvent during a run on the bank. Under George, the company establishes Bailey Park, a housing development surpassing Potter's overpriced slums. Potter entices George with a high-paying job, but George rebuffs him when he realizes that Potter's true intention is to close the building and loan.\nOn Christmas Eve the town prepares a hero's welcome for Harry, a Navy fighter pilot awarded the Medal of Honor for preventing a kamikaze attack on a troopship. Billy goes to Potter's bank to deposit $8,000 of the building and loan's money. He taunts Potter with a newspaper headline about Harry, then absentmindedly wraps the cash in Potter's newspaper. Potter finds and keeps the money, while Billy cannot recall how he misplaced it. With a bank examiner reviewing the company's records, George fruitlessly retraces Billy's steps. Frustrated and angered by Billy\u2019s blunder, which may lead to scandal and jail, George resents the sacrifices he has made and the family that has kept him trapped in Bedford Falls. He appeals to Potter for a loan, offering his meager life insurance policy as collateral. Potter scoffs that George is worth more dead than alive, refuses to help, and phones the police.\nGeorge flees Potter's office, gets drunk at a bar, and prays for help. Contemplating suicide, he goes to a nearby bridge. Before George can jump, Clarence dives into the freezing river and George rescues him. When George wishes he had never been born, Clarence shows George a timeline in which he never existed. Bedford Falls is now Pottersville, an unsavory town occupied by sleazy entertainment venues and callous people. Mr. Gower was jailed for manslaughter because George was not there to stop him from poisoning the customer. George's mother does not know him. Uncle Billy was institutionalized after the building and loan failed. Bailey Park is a cemetery, where George discovers Harry's grave: Without George, Harry had drowned as a child, and without Harry to save them, the troops aboard the transport ship were killed. George finds that Mary is an \"old maid\" librarian. When he grabs her and claims to be her husband, she screams and runs away.\nGeorge flees back to the bridge and begs for his life back. His wish granted, he rushes home to await his arrest. Meanwhile, Mary and Billy have rallied the townspeople, who donate more than enough to replace the missing money. Harry arrives and toasts George as \"the richest man in town.\" Among the donations George finds a copy of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, a gift from Clarence inscribed, \"Remember, no man is a failure who has friends. Thanks for the wings!\" When a bell on the Christmas tree rings, George's youngest daughter, Zuzu, explains that \"every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings.\""

The New York Daily Times published an editorial that declared the film and James Stewart's performance to be worthy of Academy Award consideration.It's a Wonderful Life received five Academy Award nominations:\nThe Best Years of Our Lives, a drama about servicemen attempting to return to their pre-World War II lives, won most of the awards that year, including four of the five for which It's a Wonderful Life was nominated.

James Stewart and Donna Reed reprised their roles for all three radio productions. Stewart also starred in the May 8, 1949, radio adaptation presented on the Screen Directors Playhouse.\nA musical stage adaptation of the film, titled A Wonderful Life, was written by Sheldon Harnick and Joe Raposo. This version was first performed at the University of Michigan in 1986, but a planned professional production was stalled by legal wrangling with the estate of Philip Van Doren Stern. It was eventually performed in Washington, DC, by Arena Stage in 1991, and had revivals in the 21st century, including a staged concert version in New York City in 2005 and several productions by regional theatres.\nAnother musical stage adaptation of the film, titled It's a Wonderful Life \u2013 The Musical, was written by Bruce Greer and Keith Ferguson. This version premiered at the Majestic Theatre, Dallas, Texas, in 1998. It was an annual Christmas show at the theater for five years. It has since been performed at venues all around the United States.In July 2019, it was revealed that another stage musical adaptation was in development with music and lyrics by Paul McCartney (making his musical theatre debut), lyrics and book by Lee Hall and produced by Bill Kenwright. The musical was set to debut late 2020, but is still yet to be announced.A 1986 skit on Saturday Night Live features William Shatner introducing the \"lost ending\" of It's a Wonderful Life in which George Bailey (Dana Carvey) and the citizens of Bedford Falls discover that Mr. Potter (Jon Lovitz) has stolen George's money and take turns beating him up in his office.\nIn 1992, the final episode of Tiny Toon Adventures parodied It's A Wonderful Life entitled \"It's A Wonderful Tiny Toon Christmas\". In it, Buster Bunny feels sad after the failure of his play and wishes he had never become a Tiny Toon, so a guardian angel shows Buster what life would have been like without him.\nThe film was also adapted into a play in two acts by James W. Rodgers. It was first performed on December 15, 1993, at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School. The play opens with George Bailey contemplating suicide and then goes back through major moments in his life. Many of the scenes from the movie are only alluded to or mentioned in the play rather than actually dramatized. For example, in the opening scene, Clarence just mentions George having saved his brother Harry after the latter had fallen through the ice.It's a Wonderful Life: A Live Radio Play, a stage adaptation presented as a 1940s radio show, was adapted by Joe Landry and has been produced around the United States since 1997. The script is published by Playscripts, Inc.\nIn 1997, PBS aired Merry Christmas, George Bailey, taped from a live performance of the 1947 Lux Radio Theatre script at the Pasadena Playhouse. The presentation, which benefited the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, featured an all-star cast, including Bill Pullman as George, Nathan Lane as Clarence, Martin Landau as Mr. Potter, Penelope Ann Miller as Mary, and Sally Field as Mother Bailey.In 2002, the television film It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie premiered on NBC. The film is a homage to It's a Wonderful Life. In the film, Kermit the Frog wishes that he had never been born.Tony Palermo's 2005 stage adaptation has the story presented as actors making a radio-play complete with them making live sounds effectsPhilip Grecian's 2006 radio play based on the film It's a Wonderful Life is a faithful adaptation, now in its third incarnation, that has been performed numerous times by local theatres in Canada.The Last Temptation of Clarence Odbody is a 2011 novel written by John Pierson. The novel imagines the future lives of various characters if George had not survived his jump into the river.Scenes from the film are seen in the 2016 documentary Abacus: Small Enough to Jail, where Abacus Federal Savings Bank founder and chairman Thomas Sung talked about how It's a Wonderful Life influenced him.\nA stage-adaptation of the story was presented at The Tower Theatre in Winchester in December 2016 by Blue Apple Theatre with Lawrie Morris in the role of George Bailey. This is believed to be the first time an actor with an intellectual disability (Lawrie Morris had Down's Syndrome) has had the role.A new \"cinematic audio\" adaptation by David Ossman of the Firesign Theatre was produced and directed by Ossman and his wife Judith Walcutt of Otherworld Media in December 2019 at the Whidbey Island Center for the Arts.

        "content": "The Pride of the Yankees is a 1942 American sports drama film produced by Samuel Goldwyn, directed by Sam Wood, and starring Gary Cooper, Teresa Wright, and Walter Brennan. It is a tribute to the legendary New York Yankees first baseman Lou Gehrig, who died a year before its release, at age 37, from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which later became known to the lay public as \"Lou Gehrig's disease\".\nThough subtitled The Life of Lou Gehrig, the film is less a sports biography than an homage to a heroic and widely loved sports figure whose tragic and premature death touched the entire nation. It emphasizes Gehrig's relationship with his parents (particularly his strong-willed mother), his friendships with players and journalists, and his storybook romance with the woman who became his \"companion for life,\" Eleanor Twitchell. Details of his baseball career\u2014which were still fresh in most fans' minds in 1942\u2014are limited to montages of ballparks, pennants, and Cooper swinging bats and running bases, though Gehrig's best-known major league record\u20142,130 consecutive games played\u2014is prominently cited.\nYankee teammates Babe Ruth, Bob Meusel, Mark Koenig, and Bill Dickey play themselves, as does sportscaster Bill Stern. The film was adapted by Herman J. Mankiewicz, Jo Swerling, and an uncredited Casey Robinson from a story by Paul Gallico, and received 11 Oscar nominations. It ends with a re-enactment of Gehrig's poignant 1939 farewell speech at Yankee Stadium. The film's iconic closing line\u2014\"Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth\"\u2014was voted 38th on the American Film Institute's list of 100 greatest movie quotes. The film was also ranked 22nd on AFI's list of most inspiring movies."

A sportswriter befriends Gehrig and persuades a scout to come see him play. When his mother gets sick, Gehrig signs with the team he has always revered, the New York Yankees, to pay for the hospital bills. With the help of his father, he endeavors to keep his career change a secret from his mother.\nGehrig works his way up through the minor leagues and joins the Yankees. His hero, Babe Ruth, is at first condescending and dismissive of the rookie, but his strong, consistent play wins over Ruth and the rest of the team. Gehrig is unknowingly included by his teammates in playing pranks on Ruth on the team train.\nDuring a game at Comiskey Park, Gehrig trips over a stack of bats and is teased by a spectator, Eleanor (the daughter of the ballpark hot dog magnate), who laughingly calls him \"tanglefoot\". Later, they are properly introduced, leading to a relationship, and then an engagement. Gehrig's mother, who still has not accepted the fact that her son will not be an engineer, does not take this news well; Gehrig finally stands up to her, and marries Eleanor.\nThe Yankees become the dominant team in baseball, and Gehrig becomes a fan favorite. His father and fully converted mother attend games and cheer for him. In a re-creation of a famous (and possibly apocryphal) story, Gehrig visits a crippled boy named Billy in a hospital. He promises to hit two home runs in a single World Series game in the boy's honor\u2014then fulfills his promise.\nGehrig is now the \"Iron Horse\", a national hero at the peak of his career with multitudes of fans, many loyal friends, and an adoring wife. Then he begins to notice, with growing alarm, that his strength is slowly ebbing away. Though he continues to play, and extends his consecutive-game streak to a seemingly insurmountable record, his physical condition continues its inexorable decline. One day, in Detroit, he tells Yankees manager Joe McCarthy that he has become a detriment to the team and benches himself. After an examination, a doctor gives him the awful news: Gehrig has a rare, incurable disease, and only a short time to live.\nA short time later, on Lou Gehrig Day at Yankee Stadium, an older Billy finds Gehrig and shows him that he has made a full recovery, inspired by his hero's example and the two-homer fulfilled promise. Then, as Eleanor weeps softly in the stands, Gehrig addresses the fans: \"People all say that I've had a bad break. But today ... today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth.\""

Although he was ideally suited to the part due to his physical resemblance to Gehrig and the quiet strength and masculine appeal that he projected, Cooper was reluctant to accept it because he, like Goldwyn, had no interest in baseball. By one account, he had never watched a game nor even swung a bat prior to taking the role. Another problem was Cooper's age (41), particularly in scenes involving Gehrig as a young man. Cinematographer Rudolph Mat\u00e9 lighted Cooper from below during those early scenes to conceal lines and wrinkles, then gradually reduced and finally eliminated the lighting effect as the story progressed.Another important (and problematic) casting decision was Babe Ruth, as himself. Ruth's health had been declining steadily since his retirement in 1935, and by 1942 he weighed nearly 270 pounds. He was put on a strict diet to achieve a presentable weight before filming began. This rapid weight loss, on the heels of a heart attack followed by a car accident, combined with the tough shooting schedule and Ruth's propensity to keep late hours, weakened him significantly. By the time filming wrapped, he had developed pneumonia severe enough to require a period of hospitalization.Multiple published sources have asserted that Cooper, who was right-handed, could not master a convincing left-handed swing. To remedy the problem, the story went, he was filmed wearing a mirror-image uniform and swinging from the right side of the plate, then running to third base instead of first; technicians then purportedly flopped the print of the film. Tom Shieber, Senior Curator at the National Baseball Hall of Fame, has shown, however, that Cooper did indeed learn to bat left-handed, and never wore a backwards Yankees uniform nor ran to third base after swinging. Film footage was, in fact, flopped only once, during a brief sequence portraying Gehrig's minor league days at Hartford, in order to make Cooper appear to be throwing left-handed \u2014 a far more difficult task for a right-hander to master. (\"[Cooper] threw the ball like an old woman tossing a hot biscuit,\" said Lefty O'Doul, who tried unsuccessfully to teach him a convincing left-handed throw.) Scenes requiring Cooper to throw a ball as a Yankee were filmed using his stand-in, the left-handed Babe Herman.Scenes purporting to depict Yankee Stadium, Comiskey Park, and other ballparks were all filmed at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles, home of the Los Angeles Angels of the old Pacific Coast League, and a popular venue for baseball movies of the era, as well as the Home Run Derby television series."

That building is actually located on the north end of campus, well away from the baseball field; his farthest hits most likely smashed through the windows of a nearby building housing the School of Journalism.In the film, Gehrig hits two home runs in a World Series game against the St. Louis Cardinals where Babe Ruth also homers. This never occurred against the Cardinals, but did happen in Game 3 of the 1932 World Series versus the Cubs.In the film, Gehrig meets Eleanor Twitchell early in his career and marries her shortly after his first World Series.  Actually the two met in 1931, well after Gehrig was an established star. They were married in 1933.\nIn the scene where Eleanor looks through Lou's scrapbook, a newspaper clipping about Babe Ruth leaving the Yankees has a September 1935 date.  Ruth last played for the Yankees in 1934.  He had started the 1935 season as a Boston Brave, but he retired in late May.\nIn one of the film's more memorable scenes, a physician matter-of-factly informs Gehrig of his tragic diagnosis, dismal prognosis, and brief life expectancy. In fact, Mayo Clinic doctors painted an unrealistically optimistic picture of Gehrig's condition and prospects, reportedly at his wife's request. Among other things he was given \"a 50\u201350 chance of keeping me as I am\" for the foreseeable future, and was told that he \"...may need a cane in 10 or 15 years.\" Deliberate concealment of bad news from patients, particularly when cancer or an incurable degenerative disease was involved, was a relatively common practice at the time."

After Marge and Lisa plead with Ned, he agrees to put Homer on trial. At the trial, Marge saves Homer from being sent to Hell by displaying a photo from their wedding day. On the back of the photo, Homer has written that, in return for Marge giving him her hand in marriage, he pledges his soul to her forever; therefore, it was not his property to sell at the time of his deal with Ned. The case is dismissed, and Ned frees Homer, but Ned gets his revenge by turning Homer's head into a donut.\nIn \"Terror at 5+1\u20442 Feet\", Bart tries to warn the passengers on the school bus that a gremlin is loosening the lug nuts on one of the wheels, but nobody can see the gremlin. In desperation, Bart climbs halfway out the window to scare off the gremlin with an emergency flare. As Bart is pulled back into the bus by Principal Skinner and Groundskeeper Willie, he drops the flare on the gremlin, who catches fire and falls from the bus, but is found by Ned. Even though everyone sees the damage when they make it to school, Bart is sent to a psychiatric hospital for his disruptive behavior. Bart is relieved as he is finally able to rest, but is once again petrified when the gremlin appears in the back window of the ambulance, holding Ned's severed head.\nIn \"Bart Simpson's Dracula\", the Simpson family is invited to Mr. Burns' castle in Pennsylvania for a midnight feast. Bart and Lisa discover a secret staircase descending to a basement with coffins. Vampires emerge from the coffins and encircle them while Lisa reads through Burns' autobiography Yes, I Am a Vampire. Lisa escapes and tries to warn her parents that Burns has bitten Bart, but Homer and Marge pay little attention until Bart tries to bite Lisa later that night. Homer drives a stake through Burns' heart, and kills him, as Lisa believes doing so will restore Bart. The next morning, Lisa discovers that everyone else in the Simpson family is a vampire, with Marge as their head. The family breaks character and wishes the audience a happy Halloween; they then begin humming \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\"."

O'Brien worked on the \"wrap-arounds\" of Bart introducing each segment to make sure that they \"pulled\" the episode together. The wrap-arounds are based on Rod Serling's television series Night Gallery, in which Serling appears at an art gallery and introduces each episode by unveiling paintings depicting the stories. Executive producer James L. Brooks loved the show, so it was \"great fun\" for him to do the parody. Show runner David Mirkin thought the Treehouse of Horror episodes were the hardest episodes to do because the staff had to fit in all three stories in only 22 minutes. Mirkin said, \"Things had to happen really fast. They're really just crammed with jokes and story beats and everything.\"\"The Devil and Homer Simpson\" was written by Daniels and McGrath. The first time Devil Flanders appears, he resembles the devil Chernabog from Fantasia (1940); Silverman particularly admired the animation in that sequence. Oakley loved the idea of Flanders being the Devil because he was the character whom viewers would least expect. He also thought Harry Shearer did a good job of playing Flanders in a much darker way, while remaining very true to the character. Many scenes had to be cut to shorten the segment, including one that showed Homer's severed head being used as a bowling ball by a demon in hell. This scene later appeared in the clip show episode \"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\", which aired in the show's seventh season.\"Terror at 5+1\u20442 Feet\" was written by Oakley and Weinstein. It was inspired by The Twilight Zone episode \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\", in which William Shatner's character is inside an airplane watching a gremlin tear apart the wing. Silverman watched the episode to get inspiration for Bart's facial expressions. Oakley said there was a lot of work put into the design of the gremlin in \"Terror at 5+1\u20442 Feet\" to make him scary \"within The Simpsons universe\". Mirkin said he felt the gremlin was well-done because he looked scary and \"yet it looks like a completely organic Simpsons character\". \u00dcter, a German exchange student, makes his first appearance in this segment; he was conceived as a one-time joke, but reappeared in later episodes because Mirkin felt he was \"such a perfect stereotype\".\"Bart Simpson's Dracula\" was written by Canterbury and based on Francis Ford Coppola's film Bram Stoker's Dracula. Mirkin was a big fan of the film and pushed for a segment inspired by it. He liked the final result and felt Mr. Burns was perfect in the role of Dracula. Dracula and his castle were designed by Silverman. Mirkin, a \"big\" Peanuts fan, came up with the idea for the ending of \"Bart Simpson's Dracula\"."

The paintings seen in these segments are parodies of well-known works, including van Gogh's Self-Portrait, September 1889, Munch's The Scream, Magritte's The Son of Man, David's The Death of Marat, Dal\u00ed's The Persistence of Memory, Picasso's Three Musicians and Escher's Ascending and Descending, all featuring members of the Simpson family. (The last painting, shown before \"Bart Simpson's Dracula\", is Dogs Playing Poker.) Marge says that the following episode is scary, and that maybe viewers should listen to the War of the Worlds broadcast instead.\n\"The Devil and Homer Simpson\" is a parody of Stephen Vincent Ben\u00e9t's story \"The Devil and Daniel Webster\". The first time the Devil appears, he resembles the demon Chernabog from Fantasia. After Homer discovers a technicality and boasts that he's \"smarter than the devil\" the Devil turns into the Chernabog-esque demon and intones, \"I'll see you in Hell yet, Homer Simpson!\" The scene in Hell where Homer is fed all the doughnuts in the world, and asks for more, is a direct parody of the cartoon Pigs is Pigs, in which the character Piggy is taken in by a scientist and forced to eat all the food in the world. The demon who feeds Homer all the donuts in the world says: \"I don't understand it. James Coco went mad in fifteen minutes!\" Coco was an actor known for his culinary talents and best-selling cookbooks. The \"jury of the damned\" includes John Wilkes Booth, Lizzie Borden, John Dillinger, Blackbeard, Benedict Arnold, Richard Nixon (who points out that he is not yet dead) and the starting lineup of the 1976 Philadelphia Flyers, a reference to their days as the Broad Street Bullies, when they were notorious for their violent playing style.\n\"Terror at 5+1\u20442 Feet\" is a parody of The Twilight Zone episode \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\", later remade as  the final segment of Twilight Zone: The Movie. In the school bus, Martin wears a shirt reading Wang Computers. Bart tells Otto there's a gremlin on the side of the bus. Hans Moleman is beside the bus driving an AMC Gremlin. Otto, assuming this is what he's referring to, sags \"No problemo, Bart dude!\" and runs Moleman off the road.\n\"Bart Simpson's Dracula\" is a parody of Francis Ford Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula. At Burns' castle, Lisa notices a tome resting on a stand in the basement: Yes, I Am a Vampire, by Monty Burns. Foreword by Steve Allen. Shortly after she finds the tome, she mistakes Bart's fearful attempts at getting her attention as impressions of Shemp and Curly Howard of the Three Stooges. Bart floating outside Lisa's bedroom window is a parody of The Lost Boys as well as Stephen King's novel Salem's Lot. The family's plan to kill the head vampire is also a reference to both the film and novel. In particular, the twist revelation that Burns is not the head vampire is also a reference to the twist ending of The Lost Boys. The segment ends with the family singing \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\" \u00e0 la A Charlie Brown Christmas.\nAlf Clausen's closing credits composition is a version of the Simpsons theme that combines the electric guitar used in The Munsters theme with the harpsichord and clicking from The Addams Family theme."

Film studio Monumental Pictures encourages rumors of a romance between Don and Lina. Don dislikes the rumors and barely tolerates Lina, but Lina believes Don loves her. At a red-carpet interview, Don tells the story of his rise to stardom. Don says he grew up cultured and highly educated, but his words are contradicted by flashbacks showing his humble roots as a hoofer, vaudeville musician and stuntman, alongside his childhood best friend, Cosmo Brown (\"Fit as a Fiddle\").\nAfter the premiere, Don escapes a mob of his fans by jumping into a passing car driven by Kathy Selden. Kathy, who claims to be a theater actress, drives Don to the premiere's afterparty, but expresses disdain for the art of film acting. At the afterparty, Monumental Pictures head R. F. Simpson shows a short demonstration of the newfound talking picture. His guests are unimpressed and assume talking pictures will be a fad. Kathy is then revealed to be a chorus girl hired to perform at the party (\"All I Do is Dream of You\"). Furious at Don's teasing, she throws a cake at him, but he dodges it and the cake hits Lina. Kathy runs away before Don can catch up with her.\nThree weeks later, Don has fallen in love with Kathy but cannot find her. Cosmo tries to cheer Don up (\"Make 'Em Laugh\"). Lina reveals that she got Kathy fired. On the studio lot, Cosmo finds Kathy working as an extra in another Monumental Pictures production (\"Beautiful Girl\"). Kathy admits to actually being a fan of Don's, while Don professes his feelings for her (\"You Were Meant for Me\").\n\nRival studio Warner Bros. releases its first talking picture, The Jazz Singer, to wide acclaim. R. F. decides he has no choice but to convert the next Lockwood and Lamont film, The Dueling Cavalier, into a talkie; Lina and Don undertake elocution lessons in preparation (\"Moses Supposes\"). The production is beset with difficulties, most notably Lina's grating, high-pitched voice and the actors being unfamiliar with the recording technology. Due to multiple complications (including awkward microphone placements, Don's uninspired improvising and the audio going out of sync), The Dueling Cavalier's preview screening is a failure.\nAfterward, Kathy and Cosmo suggest The Dueling Cavalier be turned into a musical (\"Good Morning\"). Cosmo, inspired by the film's synchronization error, suggests Kathy should dub Lina's voice. Don happily agrees. Don takes Kathy home, then dances through her neighborhood in the rain (\"Singin' in the Rain\"). Don and Cosmo pitch their idea to R. F., changing the title of the film to The Dancing Cavalier and adding a modern framing device. R. F. approves but tells them not to inform Lina of Kathy's involvement.\nHaving learned the truth, a furious Lina barges in on a dubbing session. She becomes even angrier after being told that Don and Kathy are in love, and that R. F. intends to give Kathy a screen credit and a big publicity buildup. Lina threatens to sue R. F. unless he makes sure no one ever hears of Kathy and that she keeps dubbing Lina for the rest of her career. R. F. reluctantly agrees because of a clause in Lina's contract which holds the studio responsible for positive media coverage.\nThe premiere of The Dancing Cavalier is a success (\"Would You\"). When the audience clamors for Lina to sing live, Don, Cosmo, and R. F. tell her to lip sync into a microphone while Kathy, concealed behind the curtain, sings into a second one. While Lina is \"singing\" (\"Singin' in the Rain Reprise\"), Don, Cosmo and R. F. open the curtain, revealing the ruse. The defeated Lina flees in humiliation. Kathy tries to run away as well, but Don proudly announces to the audience that Kathy is \"the real star\" of the film (\"You Are My Lucky Star\"). Some time later, Kathy and Don kiss in front of a billboard for their new film, Singin' in the Rain."

        "content": "Wag the Dog is a 1997 American political satire black comedy film produced and directed by Barry Levinson and starring Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro. The film centers on a spin doctor and a Hollywood producer who fabricates a war in Albania to distract voters from a presidential sex scandal. The screenplay by Hilary Henkin and David Mamet was loosely adapted from Larry Beinhart's 1993 novel, American Hero.\nWag the Dog was released one month before the news broke of the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal and the bombing of the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan by the Clinton administration in August 1998, which prompted the media to draw comparisons between the film and reality. The comparison was also made in December 1998, when the administration initiated a bombing campaign of Iraq during Clinton's impeachment trial for the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal. It was made again in spring 1999, when the administration intervened in the Kosovo War and initiated a bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, which, coincidentally, bordered Albania and contained ethnic Albanians. The film grossed $64.3 million on a $15 million budget, and was well received by critics, who praised the direction, performances, themes and humor. Hoffman received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, and screenwriters David Mamet and Hilary Henkin were both nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay."

Conrad Brean, a top spin doctor, is brought in by presidential aide Winifred Ames to take the public's attention away from the scandal. He decides to construct a fictional war in Albania, hoping the media will concentrate on this instead. Brean contacts Hollywood producer Stanley Motss to create the war, complete with a theme song and fake film footage of a fleeing orphan to arouse sympathy. The hoax is initially successful, with the president quickly gaining ground in the polls.\nWhen the CIA learns of the plot, they send Agent Young to confront Brean about the hoax. Brean convinces Young that revealing the deception is against his and the CIA's best interests. But when the CIA \u2014 in collusion with the president's rival candidate \u2014 reports that the war has ended, the media begins to focus back on the president's sexual abuse scandal. To counter this, Motss invents a hero who was left behind enemy lines in Albania.\nInspired by the idea that he was \"discarded like an old shoe\", Brean and Motss ask the Pentagon to provide a special forces soldier with a matching name (a sergeant named \"Schumann\" is identified), around whom a POW narrative can be constructed. As part of the hoax, folk singer Johnny Dean records a song called \"Old Shoe\", which is pressed onto a 78 rpm record, prematurely aged so that listeners will think it was recorded years earlier, and sent to the Library of Congress to be \"found\". Soon, large numbers of old pairs of shoes begin appearing on phone and power lines, and a grassroots movement takes hold.\nWhen the team goes to retrieve Schumann, they discover he is in fact a criminally insane Army convict. On the way back, their plane crashes en route to Andrews Air Force Base. The team survives and is rescued by a farmer, an illegal alien who is given expedited citizenship for a better story. However, Schumann is killed when he attempts to rape a gas station owner's daughter. Seizing the opportunity, Motss stages an elaborate military funeral for Schumann, claiming he died from wounds sustained during his rescue.\nWhile watching a political talk show, Motss gets frustrated that the media are crediting the president's upsurge in the polls to the bland campaign slogan of \"Don't change horses in mid-stream\" rather than to Motss's hard work. Motss states he wants credit and will reveal his involvement, despite Brean's offer of an ambassadorship and the dire warning that he is \"playing with his life\". After Motss refuses to change his mind, Brean reluctantly orders his security staff to kill him. A newscast reports that Motss has died of a heart attack at home, the president has been successfully re-elected, and an Albanian terrorist organization has claimed responsibility for a recent bombing, suggesting the fake war is prompting a real one."

The idiom stems from the 1870s. In a local newspaper, The Daily Republican: \"Calling to mind Lord Dundreary's conundrum, the Baltimore American thinks that for the Cincinnati Convention to control the Democratic party would be the 'tail wagging the dog'.\"The phrase, then and now, indicates a backwards situation in which a small and seemingly unimportant entity (the tail) controls a bigger, more important one (the dog). It was used again in the 1960s. The film became a \"reality\" the year after it was released, due to the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal. Days after admitting to wrongdoing, President Bill Clinton ordered missile strikes against two countries, Afghanistan and Sudan. During his impeachment proceedings, Clinton also bombed Iraq, drawing further \"wag the dog\" accusations, and with the scandal still on the public's mind in March 1999, his administration launched a bombing campaign against Yugoslavia."

On Christmas Eve, Jim prepares for his final performance before marrying Lila and retiring on a farm in Connecticut. Lila tells Jim she has fallen in love with the notorious charmer Ted instead; heartbroken, Jim bids them goodbye.\nHe tries to make a go of working the farm, but ends up in a sanatorium instead. The following Christmas Eve, Jim is back in New York City with plans to turn his farm into \"Holiday Inn,\" an entertainment venue open only on holidays, to the amusement of Ted and his agent Danny Reed. In a flower shop, Danny is pitched by sales girl and aspiring performer Linda Mason; he steers her to Holiday Inn and Ted's club. Later that night, Linda and Jim accidentally meet at a performance by Ted and Lila. Jim pretends to own a rival club, while Linda postures as a celebrity friend of Ted's, only to flee when Ted and Lila approach.\nOn Christmas Day, Linda arrives at Holiday Inn and meets Jim, the pair immediately realizing their deception. Jim sings her his new song, \"White Christmas\".\nOn New Year's Eve, Holiday Inn opens to a packed house. Back in New York City, Ted learns that Lila is leaving him for a Texas millionaire. Drinking heavily, he arrives at Holiday Inn at midnight and literally stumbles into Linda. They dance and bring down the house, which believes it all to be a polished act. Danny arrives and is ecstatic that Ted has found a new partner, but in the morning, Ted does not remember Linda. Jim hides her, afraid Ted will steal her away.\nOn Lincoln's Birthday, Ted and Danny search for Linda, but Jim convinces Linda to play the minstrel show number \"Abraham\" in blackface together to foil them. While applying Linda's makeup, Jim asks her to stay there with him between holidays, which she interprets as a proposal. He affirms it but equivocates that only when he can afford to. Leaving empty-handed, Ted and Danny plan to return.\nRehearsing for Valentine's Day, Jim presents Linda with a new song, \"Be Careful, It's My Heart\". Ted arrives and launches into an impromptu dance with Linda. Recognizing her from New Year's Eve, he demands that Jim prepare them a number to perform in the next show.\nOn Washington's Birthday, Ted and Linda dance in elaborate 18th-century period costumes, with Jim sabotaging their tempo from a minuet to jazz throughout. Linda refuses Ted's offer to become his dance partner, saying that she and Jim are to be married. When Ted asks him about the engagement, Jim plays it off, but Ted is unconvinced.\nAt Easter, romance blossoms between Jim and Linda. They are met by Ted, who asks to remain in Jim's shows to experience \"the true happiness\" they have found. Linda is charmed, but Jim is suspicious.\nJim's apprehensions are confirmed on Independence Day, when he overhears Ted and Danny's bringing a pair of Hollywood representatives to audition Ted and Linda for motion pictures from that night's show. Jim bribes teamster Gus to stall Linda, who ends up driving the pair into a creek. Linda gets picked up on the roadside by Lila. Having left the penniless \"millionaire\", she crows that she will be Ted's partner that night for the studio tryout. Assuming that Jim made the switch to keep her from leaving, Linda directs Lila into the creek.\nAt the inn, Ted is forced to improvise a solo, a fireworks-studded tap dance routine. Linda arrives, irritated that Jim did not trust her to make her own decision. She joins Ted, Hollywood-bound. Jim reluctantly agrees to let the eager producers make a film about Holiday Inn, but vows not to leave the Inn.\nThanksgiving finds the Inn closed, and Jim wallowing in self-pity. As he prepares to mail his new song, his housekeeper Mamie implores him to fight to win Linda back.\nJim arrives in California on Christmas Eve, just as Ted and Linda plan to marry. Jim confronts Ted in his dressing room, gets locked in, then turns the table on Ted and Danny. On the set of Linda's movie, a meticulous recreation of Holiday Inn, Jim leaves his pipe on the piano and hides as Linda enters and performs \"White Christmas\". Reflexively ringing tiny bells with it as he did, she falters, then continues waveringly as Jim's voice joins her. Jim appears and Linda runs to him.\nBack at Holiday Inn on New Year's Eve, Ted is reunited with Lila. Jim and Linda sing a duet, affirming their love."

Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire were the stars of Holiday Inn with support from Marjorie Reynolds and Virginia Dale. Filming took place between November 18, 1941, and January 30, 1942. Produced and directed by Mark Sandrich, Holiday Inn had its premiere at the New York City Paramount Theatre August 4, 1942. It was a success in the US and the UK, the highest-grossing film musical to that time. It was expected that \"Be Careful, It's My Heart\" would be the hit song. While it did very well, \"White Christmas\" topped the charts in October 1942 instead, and stayed there for eleven weeks. Another Berlin song, \"Happy Holiday\", is featured over the opening credits and within the film storyline.Filming outside the studio occurred at the Village Inn Resort in Monte Rio on the Russian River, in Sonoma County, California.Many segments of the film are preceded by shots of a calendar with a visual symbol of the given holiday. For November, an animated turkey is shown running back and forth between the third and fourth Thursdays, finally shrugging its shoulders in confusion. This is a satirical reference to the \"Franksgiving\" controversy created when President Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to expand the Christmas shopping season by declaring Thanksgiving a week earlier than before, leading to Congress setting Thanksgiving as the fourth Thursday in November by law.The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii occurred halfway through filming. As a result, the Fourth of July segment was expanded beyond Fred Astaire's firecracker dance to include the patriotic number that highlights the strength of the US military."

The cast includes William Holden, Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, and Sessue Hayakawa.\nIt was initially scripted by screenwriter Carl Foreman, who was later replaced by Michael Wilson.

U.S. Navy Commander Shears tells Nicholson that the camp conditions are horrific. Nicholson forbids any escape attempts because headquarters ordered them to surrender. Also, the dense surrounding jungle renders escape virtually impossible.\nColonel Saito, the camp commandant, informs the new prisoners they will construct a railway bridge over the River Kwai connecting Bangkok and Rangoon. Nicholson objects, citing the Geneva Convention exempting officers from manual labour. Saito threatens to have the officers shot, until Major Clipton, the British medical officer, warns there are too many witnesses. The officers are left standing in the intense heat until evening when Saito then confines them to a punishment hut. Nicholson is beaten and locked in an iron box.\nMeanwhile, Shears and two other prisoners escape. Shears is wounded and wanders into a Burmese village, where he is nursed back to health. He eventually reaches the British colony of Ceylon.\nThe bridge construction proceeds badly due to faulty Japanese engineering and the prisoners' slow pace and sabotage. Saito is required to commit ritual suicide if the completion deadline is unmet. Desperate, he releases Nicholson and his officers, exempting them from manual labour. Nicholson, shocked by the poor job his men have done, orders building a proper bridge. He considers it a tribute to the British Army's ingenuity but Clipton argues it is collaboration with the enemy. Nicholson's obsession with the bridge drives him to allow officers to voluntarily work on the project.\nShears is convalescing in Ceylon near a commando school referred to as \"Force 316\". Major Warden wants to recruit Shears for a commando mission to destroy the bridge. Shears refuses only to discover he has been temporarily transferred to the British military and has no choice.\nWarden, Shears, and two other commandos\u2014Chapman and Joyce\u2014parachute into Thailand. Chapman is killed during the jump, and Warden is wounded in an encounter with a Japanese patrol. Khun Yai, a village chief, and a group of Siamese women lead Warden, Shears, and Joyce to the river. Under cover of darkness, Shears and Joyce plant explosives on the bridge towers. The first train to cross the bridge is scheduled for the following day, and Warden wants to destroy both. By daybreak, however, the river level has dropped, exposing the wire leading to the detonator.\nNicholson spots the wire, and he and Saito investigate the riverbank as the train approaches. Nicholson pulls up the wire on the riverbank, leading them toward Joyce, who is manning the detonator. Joyce breaks cover and stabs Saito to death. Nicholson inexplicably calls to Japanese soldiers for help and attempts to stop Joyce from reaching the detonator.

        "content": "The plot and characters of Boulle's novel and the screenplay were almost entirely fictional. Since it was not a documentary, there are many historical inaccuracies in the film, as noted by eyewitnesses to the building of the real Burma Railway by historians.The conditions to which POW and civilian labourers were subjected were far worse than the film depicted. According to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission:\n\nThe notorious Burma-Siam railway, built by Commonwealth, Dutch and American prisoners of war, was a Japanese project driven by the need for improved communications to support the large Japanese army in Burma. During its construction, approximately 13,000 prisoners of war died and were buried along the railway. An estimated 80,000 to 100,000 civilians also died in the course of the project, chiefly forced labour brought from Malaya and the Dutch East Indies, or conscripted in Siam (Thailand) and Burma. Two labour forces, one based in Siam and the other in Burma, worked from opposite ends of the line towards the centre.\nLieutenant Colonel Philip Toosey of the British Army was the real senior Allied officer at the bridge in question. Toosey was very different from Nicholson and was certainly not a collaborator who felt obliged to work with the Japanese. In fact Toosey strove to delay construction. While Nicholson disapproves of acts of sabotage and other deliberate attempts to delay progress, Toosey encouraged this: termites were collected in large numbers to eat the wooden structures, and the concrete was badly mixed. Some consider the film to be an insulting parody of Toosey.On a BBC Timewatch programme, a former prisoner at the camp states that it is unlikely that a man like the fictional Nicholson could have risen to the rank of lieutenant colonel, and, if he had, due to his collaboration he would have been \"quietly eliminated\" by the other prisoners.Julie Summers, in her book The Colonel of Tamarkan, writes that Boulle, who had been a prisoner of war in Thailand, created the fictional Nicholson character as an amalgam of his memories of collaborating French officers. He strongly denied the claim that the book was anti-British, although many involved in the film itself (including Alec Guinness) felt otherwise.Ernest Gordon, a survivor of the railway construction and POW camps described in the novel/film, stated in his 1962 book, Through the Valley of the Kwai: \n\nIn Pierre Boulle's book The Bridge over the River Kwai and the film which was based on it, the impression was given that British officers not only took part in building the bridge willingly, but finished in record time to demonstrate to the enemy their superior efficiency. This was an entertaining story. But I am writing a factual account, and in justice to these men\u2014living and dead\u2014who worked on that bridge, I must make it clear that we never did so willingly. We worked at bayonet point and under bamboo lash, taking any risk to sabotage the operation whenever the opportunity arose.\nA 1969 BBC television documentary, Return to the River Kwai, made by former POW John Coast, sought to highlight the real history behind the film (partly through getting ex-POWs to question its factual basis, for example Dr Hugh de Wardener and Lt-Col Alfred Knights), which angered many former POWs. The documentary itself was described by one newspaper reviewer when it was shown on Boxing Day 1974 (The Bridge on the River Kwai had been shown on BBC1 on Christmas Day 1974) as \"Following the movie, this is a rerun of the antidote.\"Some of the characters in the film use the names of real people who were involved in the Burma Railway. Their roles and characters, however, are fictionalised. For example, a Sergeant-Major Risaburo Saito was in real life second in command at the camp. In the film, a Colonel Saito is camp commandant. In reality, Risaburo Saito was respected by his prisoners for being comparatively merciful and fair towards them. Toosey later defended him in his war crimes trial after the war, and the two became friends.\nSome Japanese viewers resented the movie's depiction of their engineers' capabilities as inferior and less advanced than they were in reality. Japanese engineers had been surveying and planning the route of the railway since 1937, and they had demonstrated considerable skill during their construction efforts across South-East Asia. Some Japanese viewers also disliked the film for portraying the Allied prisoners of war as more capable of constructing the bridge than the Japanese engineers themselves were, accusing the filmmakers of being unfairly biased and unfamiliar with the realities of the bridge construction, a sentiment echoed by surviving prisoners of war who saw the film in cinemas.The major railway bridge described in the novel and film did not actually cross the river known at the time as the Kwai. However, in 1943 a railway bridge was built by Allied POWs over the Mae Klong river\u2014renamed Khwae Yai in the 1960s as a result of the film\u2014at Tha Ma Kham, five kilometres from Kanchanaburi, Thailand. Boulle had never been to the bridge. He knew that the railway ran parallel to the Kwae for many miles, and he therefore assumed that it was the Kwae which it crossed just north of Kanchanaburi. This was an incorrect assumption. The destruction of the bridge as depicted in the film is also entirely fictional. In fact, two bridges were built: a temporary wooden bridge and a permanent steel/concrete bridge a few months later. Both bridges were used for two years, until they were destroyed by Allied bombing. The steel bridge was repaired and is still in use today."

The separate dialogue, music and effects were located and remixed with newly recorded \"atmospheric\" sound effects. The image was restored by OCS, Freeze Frame, and Pixel Magic with George Hively editing.On 2 November 2010 Columbia Pictures released a newly restored The Bridge on the River Kwai for the first time on Blu-ray. According to Columbia Pictures, they followed an all-new 4K digital restoration from the original negative with newly restored 5.1 audio. The original negative for the feature was scanned at 4K (four times the resolution in High Definition), and the colour correction and digital restoration were also completed at 4K. The negative itself manifested many of the kinds of issues one would expect from a film of this vintage: torn frames, embedded emulsion dirt, scratches through every reel, colour fading. Unique to this film, in some ways, were other issues related to poorly made optical dissolves, the original camera lens and a malfunctioning camera. These problems resulted in a number of anomalies that were very difficult to correct, like a ghosting effect in many scenes that resembles colour mis-registration, and a tick-like effect with the image jumping or jerking side-to-side. These issues, running throughout the film, were addressed to a lesser extent on various previous DVD releases of the film and might not have been so obvious in standard definition."

        "content": "In London, Professor Henry Higgins, a scholar of phonetics, believes that one's accent determines a person's prospects in society (\"Why Can't the English?\"). At the Covent Garden fruit-and-vegetable market one evening, he listens to Eliza Doolittle, a young flower seller with a strong Cockney accent, and makes notes. This causes others to suspect he is a \"tec\". When Eliza protests that she has done nothing wrong, she asks Colonel Hugh Pickering, himself a phonetics expert, to confirm this. Pickering and Higgins are delighted to become acquainted; in fact, Pickering had come from India just to meet Higgins. Higgins boasts he could teach even someone like Eliza to speak so well he could pass her off as a duchess at an embassy ball. Eliza wants to work in a flower shop, but her accent makes that impossible (\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\"). The following morning, Eliza shows up at Higgins's home, seeking lessons. Pickering is intrigued and offers to cover all the attendant expenses if Higgins succeeds. Higgins agrees and describes how women ruin lives (\"I'm an Ordinary Man\").\nEliza's father, Alfred P. Doolittle, a dustman, learns of his daughter's new residence (\"With a Little Bit of Luck\"). He shows up at Higgins's house three days later, ostensibly to protect his daughter's virtue, but in reality to extract some money from Higgins, and is bought off with \u00a35. Higgins is impressed by the man's honesty, his natural gift for language, and especially his brazen lack of morals. Higgins recommends Alfred to a wealthy American who is interested in morality.\nEliza endures Higgins's demanding teaching methods and harsh treatment (\"Just You Wait\"), while the servants feel both annoyed with the noise as well as pity for Higgins (\"Servants' Chorus\"). She makes no progress, but just as she, Higgins, and Pickering are about to give up, Eliza finally \"gets it\" (\"The Rain in Spain\"); she instantly begins to speak with an impeccable upper-class accent, and is overjoyed at her breakthrough (\"I Could Have Danced All Night\").\nAs a trial run, Higgins takes her to Ascot Racecourse (\"Ascot Gavotte\"), where she makes a good impression initially, only to shock everyone by a sudden lapse into vulgar Cockney while cheering on a horse. Higgins is amused. There, she meets Freddy Eynsford-Hill, a young upper-class man who becomes infatuated with her (\"On the Street Where You Live\").\nHiggins then takes Eliza to an embassy ball, where she dances with a foreign prince. Zoltan Karpathy, a Hungarian trained by Higgins, watches and listens, and declares she is a Hungarian princess.\nAfterward, Eliza's hard work is ignored, with all the praise going to Higgins (\"You Did It\"). This and his callous treatment of her, especially his indifference to her future, causes her to walk out on him, but not before she throws his slippers at him, leaving him mystified by her ingratitude (\"Just You Wait [Reprise]\"). Outside, Freddy is waiting (\"On the Street Where You Live [Reprise]\") and greets Eliza, who is irritated by him as all he does is talk (\"Show Me\"). She tries to return to her old life, but finds that she no longer fits in. She meets her father, who has been left a large fortune by the wealthy American to whom Higgins had recommended him, and is resigned to marrying Eliza's stepmother. Alfred feels that Higgins has ruined him, lamenting that he is now bound by \"middle-class morality\" (\"Get Me to the Church On Time\"). Eliza eventually visits Higgins's mother, who is outraged at her son's behavior.\nThe next day, Higgins finds Eliza gone and searches for her (\"A Hymn to Him\"), eventually finding her at his mother's house. He attempts to talk her into coming back to him. He becomes angered when she announces that she is going to marry Freddy and become Karpathy's assistant (\"Without You\"). He goes home, predicting that she will come crawling back. However, he comes to the realization that she has become important to him (\"I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face\"). He turns on his gramophone and listens to her voice. When she shows up, Higgins nonchalantly asks, \"Eliza, where the devil are my slippers?\""

However, Edward did not propose to Selena, and angrily denounces arranged marriages (\"Why Can't I Be Two People?\"). Edward prefers to marry for love while his parents want a political alliance (\"What Has Love Got to Do with Being Married?\").\nMeanwhile, Cinderella's cruel stepmother has banished her to the cellar, and forces her to work as a servant to her and her two vindictive daughters, Isobella and Palatine. Cinderella finds some comfort in remembering happier times (\"Once I Was Loved\"). Whilst putting flowers by her parents' grave, she inadvertently stumbles upon the prince, and his friend and bodyguard John, who are visiting the Royal crypt. The Prince sardonically talks about his dead ancestors, with whom he will one day be buried (\"What a Comforting Thing to Know\").\nBack at the castle, the King of Euphrania is advised that a marriage between Edward and a Princess from one of Euphrania's neighboring countries (and thus potential enemies) would help prevent war. A ball is seen as the perfect way to help Edward choose his bride (\"Protocolligorically Correct\"). The Prince hates the idea, though his cousin Montague is delighted (\"Bride-finding Ball\"). When news arrives that Carolsveld intends to make war on Euphrania, Edward has no choice but to accept. However, fewer than half the princesses accept the invitation, so the local nobility, including Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters, are invited.\nBecause of the lack of dresses at the dressmakers, the stepmother and stepsisters demand that Cinderella sew all three of them elegant gowns for the ball from the fabric of their old dresses. Cinderella has no idea what to do. As luck would have it a fairy godmother, who has a talent for sensing the wishes of those who are pure in heart, arrives and creates three beautiful gowns while Cinderella rests. That night, the stepmother and stepsisters depart for the ball leaving Cinderella alone. Cinderella's fairy godmother returns and informs Cinderella that she too can go to the ball. She transforms Cinderella's shabby dress into a lovely gown, arranges her hair in the period fashion, and a coach and horses are magically prepared. Cinderella is sent off to the ball with a warning that the magic can only last until midnight (\"Suddenly It Happens\"). It is love at first sight when Cinderella and Edward meet at the ball (\"Secret Kingdom\"). As the clock strikes midnight, Cinderella races away, leaving behind only her glass slipper (\"He / She Danced With Me\").\nEdward sends his servants out far and wide in search of the woman who fits the glass slipper. The search turns out empty-handed. Edward builds a monument for the slipper and hopes that one day his lost love will turn up. John is also suffering as a result of love: he is in love with a noblewoman, but his position forbids them to be together (\"Position and Positioning\"). Edward knights John, so John can pursue his romance with Lady Caroline. Finally, frustrated by his fruitless search, Edward breaks the monument, tossing the slipper into the woods where Cinderella finds and starts to dance with it, which catches John's attention and he rushes off to inform the Prince.\nCinderella and Edward are reunited and greeted by her stepmother and stepsisters. Edward asks the permission of the stepmother to marry Cinderella and she gives full permission, if only to get Cinderella off her hands. Cinderella tells her stepmother and stepsisters that she forgives them for their abuse. In the throne room, Edward and Cinderella go before the King and Queen. Whilst the King and Queen find Cinderella to be charming, something seems to be troubling the King. He takes the Lord Chamberlain aside and tells him that there is no way his son and Cinderella, a non-royal, can be married. The Lord Chamberlain conveys this to Cinderella, explaining also that a military alliance through marriage must be established with one of the neighboring kingdoms to protect them against war and to secure the safety and future existence of Euphrania. Along with this disheartening news, it is also explained that she will have to be exiled that very night to avoid a war with Carolsveld. Brokenhearted, Cinderella asks the Lord Chamberlain to tell Edward that she never loved him, because she knows that Edward will try to find her because of his love for her (\"Tell Him\").\nAfter finding out what the King has done to Cinderella from John, an exasperated Edward confronts him for ruining his chances of a love and happy marriage. Realizing the situation at hand and how the King and Queen won't give up their stance on a political marriage, he agrees to marry whomever they choose, but says that his marital duties will go no further than the altar. He lays a curse that their royal house will die with him and throw Euphrania into chaos. The King now feels guilt over exiling Cinderella, but he had no choice due to his own fears of a war with Carolsveld. On the day of his wedding, Edward begs Cinderella to forgive him for marrying Selena, unaware that the fairy godmother heard him. Cinderella living peacefully in exile in another country, still thinks of Edward (\"I Can't Forget the Melody\"). Her fairy godmother arrives and asks Cinderella why she isn't at the castle as Edward is getting married that day. Cinderella, surprised, asks who Edward is marrying. The fairy godmother doesn't know, as it's most certainly the wrong woman, but plans to set things right\u2014again.\nBack at the castle, as the wedding is taking place, everyone is surprised when Cinderella shows up in a wedding gown. The King interrupts the wedding and he and his council meet in private. The fairy godmother joins the discussion and convinces the king to change the law, so that Edward can marry the girl of his choice. In a surprising twist, Edward's cousin and the chosen bride fall in love at first sight, and marry, thus fulfilling the alliance after all. Cinderella and Edward live happily ever after."

As it was never put out on VHS by MCA, the MCA Laserdisc was the only US video release of any kind prior to 2000, likely due to Universal's distribution rights lapsing and having reverted to production company Paradine.In the UK and Australia, where it was more successful, it spanned several VHS releases by the likes of Video Gems and CEL Home Video respectively. These releases feature the full length UK theatrical version, which includes the songs \"What Has Love Got to Do with Being Married\" and \"I Can't Forget the Melody\" that were cut from the US release.In 2000, independent distributor Castle Hill (who had acquired US distribution rights in the mid 1990s) licensed the film to Image Entertainment for a US VHS and DVD release in its full length UK theatrical version.

This release is long out of print and was highly sought after prior to 2013.On 19 November 2013, the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by Inception Media Group, under licence from Castle Hill successor Westchester Films.

In addition to porting over all the extras and the audio commentary from the Image Entertainment DVD, the only new supplement is the UK theatrical trailer mastered from a 35mm element. The film has also received overseas Blu-Ray releases from Second Sight in the UK and Orustak Pictures in Japan, both utilizing the Pinewood 4K restoration and most extras from the Inception release.On 5 February 2019, Shout Factory (who had purchased Westchester Films in 2017 and reincorporated their titles under the Shout Factory branding) reissued the film on DVD and Blu-Ray.

Lisa, Grampa, and Bart each tell a horror story.\nIn Lisa's story, \"Clown Without Pity\", Homer buys a cursed Krusty the Clown doll as a last-minute birthday present for Bart. After the doll makes numerous attempts on Homer's life, he captures the doll, locks it in a suitcase, and drops it in a \"Bottomless Pit\". Returning home, Homer is ambushed by the escaped doll, who tackles him into the kitchen and tries to drown him in a dog bowl. Marge calls the consumer service hotline. A repairman arrives and discovers that the doll has been set to \"evil\" mode. He flips the switch to \"good\" and the Krusty doll becomes friends with Homer, although it is quickly put to work as Homer's slave.\nIn Grampa's story, \"King Homer\", inspired by Grampa watching lots of movies, Marge joins Mr. Burns and Mr. Smithers on an expedition to Ape Island as bait for the legendary giant ape King Homer in 1936. The natives of Ape Island capture Marge and tie her to a post as an offering for King Homer, who is summoned by the sound of drums. Marge is initially terrified but sees the friendly side of Homer, and the two form a friendship. Nonetheless, Mr. Burns is determined to capture King Homer and Smithers knocks Homer unconscious with a gas bomb. Returning to Springfield, the group display King Homer at a theater. The photographers' flashes enrage King Homer, who breaks free from his restraints. He abducts Marge and attempts to climb a skyscraper, but is unable to get past the second story of the building and collapses in exhaustion. In the end, King Homer and Marge get married.\nIn Bart's story, \"Dial \"Z\" for Zombies\", Bart finds a book of black magic in Springfield Elementary Library when he is asked to write a book report for class. That night, he tries to resurrect the family's dead cat, Snowball I, but accidentally reanimates corpses from the nearby human cemetery instead. The zombies terrorize Springfield, turning many people into zombies. Aided by Homer wielding a shotgun, Lisa and Bart find a book at the library to cast the appropriate counter-spell, causing all of the zombies to return to their graves."

With only six weeks to the airdate, the writers made almost one hundred line changes, a very rare occurrence. It was decided to completely overhaul the episode after a poorly received screening with the writing staff. The tombstones that appeared at the start of and during the episode were abandoned in later episodes because it was becoming increasingly difficult to think of ideas. A subtle tombstone joke in this episode is in the scene where two zombies are crawling out of their graves. The names Jay Kogen and Wolodarsky (two of The Simpsons writers who worked on the episode) are written on the tombstones, but both are misspelled.The \"King Homer\" segment is one of Matt Groening's all-time favorite stories from the Treehouse of Horror series. Al Jean was also quite worried about this segment because it was the longest running black-and-white segment they had ever aired, and he thought that some people might be concerned that their televisions were broken. The \"He was a zombie?\" line, created by Mike Reiss, is, in the opinions of the writers, one of the all-time classic lines from the series."

Homer's stomach is bigger than that of the silhouette, but this was so subtle that not many people got the joke. Buckminster Fuller's tombstone can be seen in the Springfield Cemetery; it is adorned with a geodesic dome. In the episode's wraparounds, Bart is dressed as Alex from A Clockwork Orange (1971).The \"Clown Without Pity\" segment is based on the Twilight Zone episode \"Living Doll\" and the film Trilogy of Terror. The title itself is a play on the song \"Town Without Pity\", written for the movie of the same name and performed by Gene Pitney. The man that sells Homer the Krusty doll is based on Mr. Wing from Gremlins (1984). The song Homer sings in the bathtub is a variation of the Oscar Mayer song with the letters spelling out his name instead of \"O-S-C-A-R\". Bernard Herrmann's music from Psycho is heard as the Krusty doll chases Homer. The Krusty doll riding under Homer's car is a reference to the 1991 film Cape Fear. The song Marge hears while put on hold after calling the Krusty doll hotline is \"Everybody Loves a Clown\" by Gary Lewis & the Playboys. A brief parody of the Love, American Style theme plays at the end of the segment as well as the \"King Homer\".\nThe \"King Homer\" segment is a parody of the 1933 film King Kong. The tribal leader is heard saying \"Mosi Tatupu, Mosi Tatupu\", which  the subtitles inform us means \"We will sacrifice the blue-haired lady.\" The scene of King Homer on Broadway is based on Young Frankenstein (1974). During his rampage, he spots Shirley Temple singing \"On the Good Ship Lollipop\", and ends up eating her. Mr. Burns says \"I remember when Al Jolson ran amok at the Winter Garden and climbed the Chrysler Building.\"\nThe title \"Dial \"Z\" for Zombies\" is a play on the title of the 1954 Hitchcock film Dial M for Murder. It parodies Night of the Living Dead, Return of the Living Dead,  and Pet Sematary. In the pet cemetery, there are tombstones that read Fish Police, Capitol Critters and Family Dog, each a short-lived animated series intended to capitalize on The Simpsons' success. When casting the spell, Bart wears the album cover of Michael Jackson's Thriller on his head. This is a reference to Jackson's famous music video, in which he dances with zombies. As Zombie William Shakespeare is dying he says \u201cIs this the end of Zombie William Shakespeare?\u201d, which is a reference to the line from Little Caesar \u201cMother of mercy, is this the end of Rico?\u201d Homer's weapon of choice for \"Dial \"Z\" for Zombies\", a sawn-off Winchester Model 1887 lever-action shotgun; is a reference to Terminator 2: Judgment Day and the scene where Homer guns down zombies in the hallway of Springfield Elementary's library is a direct reference to the Terminator's first battle with the T-1000."

The segment was the idea of another writer.The third segment, \"Night of the Dolphin\" was written by Carolyn Omine. The writers wanted to have a segment in a tribute to an animal and settled on dolphins, because they are \"the friendliest animal in the world\". Omine conceived the way the dolphins walked on land and pitched this to director Matthew Nastuk. The King Dolphin's voice is Harry Shearer's normal voice. There are two deleted scenes that are now available on the DVD: One with Dr. Julius Hibbert fighting with hypodermics and one where Moe Szyslak puts a gas tube down a dolphin's blow hole during the humans vs. dolphin war.

After a scene in which his wife searches frantically and finds a poppet left by a jealous work rival, he discovers that his wife, Tansy, is practising obeah, referred to in the film as \"conjure magic\", which she learned in Jamaica. She insists that her charms have been responsible for his rapid advancement in his academic career and for his general well-being. A firm rationalist, Norman is angered by her acceptance of superstition. He forces her to burn all her magical paraphernalia.\nAlmost immediately things start to go wrong: a female student accuses Norman of rape, her boyfriend threatens him with violence, and someone tries to break into the Taylors' home during a thunderstorm. Tansy, willing to sacrifice her life for her husband's safety, almost drowns herself and is only saved at the last minute by Norman giving in to the practices he despises.\nTansy attacks him with a knife while in a trance, but Norman disarms her and locks her in her room. Her limping walk during the attack gives Norman a clue to the person responsible for his ill luck: university secretary Flora Carr, the wife of Lindsay whose career had stalled in favour of Norman's. Flora uses witchcraft to set fire to the Taylor home with Tansy trapped inside.\nUsing a form of auditory hypnosis over a loudspeaker system, Flora convinces Norman that a giant stone eagle perching at the top of the university chapel has come to life to attack him. Lindsay arrives at the office and turns off the loudspeaker, and the illusory eagle vanishes. Tansy escapes her burning home and rejoins her no longer sceptical  husband. On their way out of the campus, Lindsay sees the chapel's heavy doors are ajar (left thus by Norman in his \"escape\" from the eagle), and insists on securing them despite Flora's protests. As she waits for him, the eagle statue falls from the roof and kills her."

        "content": "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a 2004 American science fiction romantic drama film directed by Michel Gondry based on Charlie Kaufman's  screenplay, and a story by Michel Gondry, Kaufman, and Pierre Bismuth. The film stars Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, with Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, and Tom Wilkinson in supporting roles. The film follows two individuals who undergo a procedure to erase each other from their memories following the dissolution of their relationship. The title of the film is a quotation from the 1717 poem Eloisa to Abelard by Alexander Pope. It uses elements of psychological drama, science fiction, and a nonlinear narrative to explore the nature of memory and love.Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind opened in theaters in the United States on March 19, 2004, to widespread acclaim from critics and audiences, who hailed the visual style, editing, writing, score, themes, Gondry\u2019s direction, and the performances of the cast, especially Carrey and Winslet. The film was a box office success, grossing $74 million on a $20 million budget, and was named by the American Film Institute one of the Top 10 Films of 2004. At the 77th Academy Awards, Bismuth,  Gondry and Kaufman won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, and Winslet received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. The film became a cult classic in the years since its release and is considered by many critics as one of the best films of the 2000s, and one of the greatest films of all time."

Heartbroken, he decides to undergo the same procedure. In preparation, he records a tape recounting his memories of their volatile relationship.\nThe Lacuna employees work on Joel's brain as he sleeps in his apartment so that he will wake up with no memory of the procedure. One employee, Patrick, leaves to see Clementine. Since her procedure, he has been using Joel's and Clementine's memories as a guide for seducing her. While the procedure runs on Joel's brain, the technician, Stan, and the secretary, Mary, take drugs, party and have sex.\nJoel re-experiences his memories of Clementine as they are erased, starting with their last fight. As he reaches earlier, happier memories, he realizes that he does not want to forget her. His mental projection of Clementine suggests that Joel hides her in memories that do not involve her. This halts the procedure, but Stan calls his boss, Howard, who arrives and restarts it. Joel comes to his last remaining memory of Clementine: the day they first met, on a beach in Montauk. As the memory crumbles around them, Clementine tells Joel to meet her in Montauk.\nIn Joel's apartment, while Stan is outside, Mary tells Howard she is in love with him and they kiss. Howard's wife arrives and sees them through the window. Furious, she tells Howard to tell Mary the truth: that Mary and Howard previously had an affair, and that Mary had her memories erased. Disgusted, Mary steals the Lacuna records and mails them to the patients, including Joel and Clementine.\nJoel wakes up, his memories of Clementine erased. He impulsively goes to Montauk and meets Clementine on the train home. They are drawn to each other and go on a date to the frozen Charles River in Boston. Joel drives Clementine home and Patrick sees them, realizing they have found each other again. Joel and Clementine receive their Lacuna records and listen to their tapes. They are shocked by the bitter memories they had of each other and almost separate again, but agree to try again."

        "content": "Jim Carrey as Joel Barish: A bookish introvert who enters a two-year relationship with Clementine Kruczynski. After their relationship ends, Clementine erases Joel from her memory, and he erases her from his mind in response. Charlie Kaufman depicted Joel with some of his autobiographical personality traits. Producers cast Carrey against type for his role as Joel, selecting him for his everyday appearance, as well as his comedic ability. According to Gondry, this was because \"It's hard to be funny. It's far easier to take someone really funny and bring them down than do the opposite.\" To induce Carrey, an actor who typically portrayed high-energy roles, to portray a restrained character, Gondry would not allow him to improvise, a restriction he did not place on the other cast members (Carrey objected). Gondry also put Carrey off balance by giving misleading orders or by rolling the camera at the wrong time. Gondry believed this would make Carrey forget what he should do to be Joel, allowing him to go in character. In the 2017 Netflix documentary Jim & Andy, Carrey mentions a conversation with Gondry one year before shooting began for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, shortly after Carrey had a breakup with an unspecified woman. Gondry saw that Carrey's emotional state at the time was \"so beautiful, so broken\" that he asked him to stay that way for one year to fit the character. In the documentary, Carrey commented, \"That's how fucked up this business is.\" Nicolas Cage was Gondry's original choice to play Joel, but Cage was unavailable as he was in high demand from independent directors after his performance in Leaving Las Vegas.\nKate Winslet as Clementine Kruczynski: A spontaneous extrovert who, after breaking up with him after a two-year relationship, erases Joel Barish from her mind. Producers cast Winslet against type for her part as Clementine, as Winslet had previously featured heavily in period pieces. She received the role after she was the only actress to offer criticism on the script instead of pandering to the writers. After another actress won an Oscar, the studio attempted to make Gondry use her instead of Winslet for the role of Clementine, but Gondry threatened to walk from the project if that occurred. During filming, Gondry took Winslet to a separate room to coach her, and she wore wigs instead of dying her hair. Some commentators note how Clementine's character criticizes the Manic Pixie Dream Girl stock character several years before film critic Nathan Rabin coined the phrase. Most commentators discuss one particular example to demonstrate this criticism, wherein Clementine warns Joel she is flawed: \"Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive. But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.\" With her impulsiveness, emotional intensity (extreme mood changes), alcohol consumption, turbulent relationships, reckless behavior, and hasty idealization or devaluation of Joel, Clementine seems to exhibit traits of borderline personality disorder, although it is not clear whether Kaufman wrote her character with this specific diagnosis in mind. Gondry had earlier thought of casting Bj\u00f6rk for the role of Clementine. She feared she would be emotionally affected and rejected the invitation after reading the script.\nKirsten Dunst as Mary Svevo: The receptionist for Lacuna who, while dating Stan Fink, has a crush on Howard Mierzwiak. While erasing Joel's memory, Howard's wife catches her kissing Howard. Howard's wife reveals Mary previously had a relationship with Howard, which Howard erased from her mind. She reacts to this information by quitting her job and mailing Lacuna's company records to its customers. In the script, Mary and Howard's relationship resulted in an unplanned pregnancy, leading to Howard pressuring Mary into an abortion, which Howard also erased from her memory.\nMark Ruffalo as Stan Fink: A technician for Lacuna who is in a relationship with Mary Svevo until the reveal of her previous relationship with Howard Mierzwiak. Ruffalo received the role of Stan after providing an \"unexpected take on the role\" to Gondry when he suggested Stan be a fan of the Clash and resemble Joe Strummer.\nElijah Wood as Patrick Wertz: Patrick is a technician for Lacuna who enters a relationship with Clementine by imitating Joel. They break up when Joel and Clementine begin dating for the second time. Seth Rogen auditioned for the role.\nTom Wilkinson as Dr. Howard Mierzwiak: Howard runs Lacuna. Before the film's events, he had an affair with Mary, which ended with the relationship's erasure from her mind. Wilkinson reportedly did not enjoy the shooting of the film and clashed with Gondry.\nJane Adams as Carrie Eakin: Joel Barish's friend.

The film showcases memory as fragmented and unreliable, evident by its non-linear structure."

        "content": "In 1860 Paris, a distraught man murders his wife's doctor. Chemist Louis Pasteur (Paul Muni) has publicized the theory that microbes cause diseases. Therefore, doctors should avoid spreading by washing their hands and sterilizing their instruments in boiling water. The doctor did not do this, and the wife died of puerperal fever after giving birth.\nFrance's medical academy dismisses Pasteur\u2014notably his most vocal critic, Dr. Charbonnet (Fritz Leiber Sr.)\u2014as a crank whose recommendations are tantamount to witchcraft. Pasteur frankly calls attention to the risks of Charbonnet's non-sterile methods and correctly predicts that a member of Napoleon III's royal family who Charbonnet is attending will die of puerperal fever. Pasteur is considered dangerous because his ideas have led to murder. When the Emperor comes down against him, Pasteur leaves Paris and moves to Arbois.\nIn the 1870s, when the new French government tries to restore the economy after the Franco-Prussian War, they learn that many sheep are dying of anthrax, except around Arbois. They send representatives who realize that, after working with a small group of loyal researchers, Pasteur developed an anthrax vaccine.\nThe medical academy still opposes him and says Arbois must be free of anthrax, so the government buys land there and invites sheep farmers to use it. Pasteur objects strongly, saying the soil is full of anthrax spores, and eventually proposes an experiment. He will vaccinate 25 of the newly arrived sheep; then they and a control group of 25 others will be injected with blood from a sheep with anthrax.\nJoseph Lister (Halliwell Hobbes), the pioneer of antiseptic surgery in England, is interested enough to attend. He witnesses Pasteur's success as all the vaccinated sheep remain healthy after the other 25 die. At this point, Jean Martel (Donald Woods), a young doctor who was formerly Charbonnet's assistant but now follows Pasteur, becomes engaged to Pasteur's daughter Annette (Anita Louise).\nThe celebrations are short-lived, as a rabid dog runs through the town and bites a man. As a woman attempts to cure him by witchcraft, Pasteur laments that doctors would have no more chance of success. Moving back to Paris, he makes rabies his next project. He spreads the disease from one animal to another by injection but cannot detect any microbe being transferred (viruses had not been discovered), and the method he used to create the anthrax vaccine fails.\nCharbonnet visits the lab to gloat over Pasteur's failure. He is so confident Pasteur is a quack that he injects himself with rabies\u2014and is triumphant, as he does not get the disease. Pasteur is puzzled until his wife Marie (Josephine Hutchinson) suggests the sample may have weakened with age. This sets him on the right path, giving dogs progressively stronger injections.\nBut before his experiments conclude, a frantic mother begs him to try his untested treatment on her son (Dickie Moore), who a rabid dog has bitten. Despite fearing imprisonment or even execution for Practicing without a license to provide medical treatment, Pasteur decides he must try to save the child. During the attempt, Dr. Zaranoff (Akim Tamiroff) arrives from Russia with a group of peasants exposed to rabies. They have volunteered to receive Pasteur's treatment.\nAnnette goes into labor with Martel's child. The doctor to attend to her is unavailable, and the boy urgently needs Martel. Pasteur searches for another doctor, but he can only find Charbonnet. He begs Charbonnet to wash his hands and sterilize his instruments; Charbonnet finally agrees that if Charbonnet lives another month, Pasteur will retract and denounce all his work on rabies. Both men are honorable enough to respect the agreement. The birth goes well, but Pasteur suffers a mild stroke.\nDays later, word comes that Pasteur has permission to treat the still-alive Russians. He attends them in hospital for the first injections using a wheelchair and later a cane. The experiment is a success, and now even Charbonnet concedes he was wrong, tearing up Pasteur's retraction and asking for the shots himself.\nAfterwards, Pasteur hears that Lister will denounce him at the medical academy. He angrily attends, but it is actually a surprise. Lister praises him, Zaranoff presents him with a Russian medal, and the once-skeptical doctors honor him."

While in Bois de Boulogne, Honor\u00e9 Lachaille remarks that in Paris, marriage is not the sole option for wealthy young bon vivants like his nephew Gaston, who is bored with life. Gaston does enjoy spending time with Madame Alvarez and her granddaughter, precocious, carefree Gilberte, affectionately known as Gigi. Gigi's mother (a singer who is heard but never seen onscreen) leaves her care mostly to Madame Alvarez.\nFollowing the \"family tradition\", Madame Alvarez regularly sends Gigi to her sister, Gigi's Great-Aunt Alicia to be groomed as a courtesan, a kept mistress of wealthy men. Gigi learns proper etiquette and charm but disdains the trivial love between a man and his mistress. She prefers to have fun with Gaston, whom she regards as an older brother or a young uncle.\nLike his uncle, Gaston is a known wealthy womanizer in Parisian high society. When his latest mistress has an affair with her ice-skating instructor, Gaston publicly humiliates her, resulting in her faux-attempted suicide. Gaston plans to retreat to the country, but his uncle insists that he remain in Paris and attend even more parties.\nWhile playing cards with Gaston, Gigi wagers that if he loses, he must take her and her grandmother to the seaside for the weekend. Gaston loses the bet, and the three travel to Trouville. While Gaston and Gigi have fun together, Honor\u00e9 and Madame Alvarez unexpectedly reunite and reminisce about their once-passionate affair. \nWhen Gaston goes to Monte Carlo, Great-Aunt Alicia and Madame Alvarez scheme to turn Gigi into Gaston's mistress. Though initially dubious, Madame Alvarez agrees to Gigi being intensively trained before Gaston's return. Gigi accepts this as pre-destined.\nWhen Gaston returns, he is discomfited when Gigi shows off her new womanly gown. Gaston insults the dress, preferring her juvenile outfits; Gigi mocks his taste in clothes. Offended, Gaston storms out, then realizes his folly and returns to apologize. He offers to take Gigi to tea at the Reservoir, but Madame Alvarez tells him that an unchaperoned Gigi being seen in public with him could damage her reputation.\nAngered, Gaston storms out again. He reflects on Gigi, realizing he has developed a romantic desire for her. Although hesitant due to her young age, Gaston realizes that he loves Gigi. He proposes a generous \"business arrangement\" to Madame Alvarez and Aunt Alicia for Gigi to become his mistress. Gigi refuses, telling Gaston she does not seek celebrity status, only to eventually be abandoned by him and become another man's mistress. She wants their relationship to remain platonic, but when Gaston reveals that he loves her, Gigi chastises him, saying if he truly loved her, he would never expose her to a mistress's uncertain life. She later sends for Gaston and tells him that she would rather be miserable with him than without him, and agrees to the arrangement. \nThe couple go to Maxim's restaurant. Gigi performs perfectly as his courtesan, which upsets Gaston. After presenting her with an expensive emerald bracelet, he grows uneasy with the unrelenting scrutiny being heaped on them. Honor\u00e9 congratulates Gaston on his new courtesan and remarks that Gigi is so delightful that she will likely keep him amused for months.\nGaston, too in love with Gigi to subject her to uncertainty and social judgment, insists they leave.

        "content": "Following completion of the film, it was previewed in Santa Barbara. Audience reaction was overwhelmingly favorable, but Lerner and Loewe were dissatisfied with the result. Lerner felt it was twenty minutes too long and most of the action too slow. The changes he proposed would cost an additional $300,000, money Freed was loath to spend. The songwriting team offered to buy 10% of the film for $300,000, then offered $3 million for the print. Impressed with their belief in the film, MGM executives agreed to the changes, which included eleven days of considerable reshooting, putting the project at $400,000 over budget. At a preview in Encino, audience reaction changed from \"appreciation to affection\", and Lerner felt the film finally was ready for release. It premiered at the Royale Theatre, a legitimate theatrical venue in New York City, on May 15, 1958.The film had 10 reserved seat engagements in the United States before opening in selected cities on a continuous run basis from October 2, 1958. The film entered saturation release in the United States with 450 prints on April 1, 1959."

The film's screenplay was largely inspired by Stallone's original screenplay for Beverly Hills Cop (1984).\nCobra was released to generally negative reviews with criticism focused on its excessive violence and overuse of genre tropes, but it was a box office success, earning $49 million in the U.S. and $160 million worldwide.

Marion \"Cobra\" Cobretti, a member of their elite \"Zombie Squad\", to resolve the crisis. Infiltrating the supermarket, Cobretti stands off with the shooter, who espouses social Darwinist ideals and mentions a \"New World\", and kills him before he can execute a group of hostages. As the scene is processed, Cobretti is reprimanded by Detective Monte for his seeming disregard for police procedures and protocols, while Cobretti himself admonishes a group of reporters harassing him for not prioritizing the safety of potential victims. \nUnbeknownst to the authorities, the supermarket incident is only part of a string of seemingly unconnected violent crimes in Los Angeles committed by the aforementioned \"New World\", a social Darwinist cult that despises modern society and believes in killing the weak, leaving only the strongest and smartest to rule the world. Ingrid Knudsen, a model and businesswoman, becomes the New World's priority target after witnessing several cultists, including their leader only known as the \"Night Slasher\", going on a killing spree. She is placed under the protective custody of Cobretti and his partner Sergeant Tony Gonzales after a failed attempt on her life. \nWhen more attempts to kill Ingrid and Cobretti are committed by multiple cultists, Cobretti theorizes the Night Slasher and his crimes are being committed by a larger organization of killers (the New World), but his theory is rebuffed by his superiors. However, the LAPD agrees with Cobretti that it will be safest if Ingrid be moved out of Los Angeles. Cobretti, Gonzales, and Ingrid travel to the small town of San Remos, where Cobretti becomes romantically involved with Ingrid. The New World sends their second-in-command, Officer Nancy Stalk, to infiltrate their police escort and compromise their whereabouts; despite Cobretti's suspicions and mistrust of Nancy, he does nothing and the group spends the night in a motel. \nAt dawn, the New World arrives in San Remos on motorcycles and besieges the town, Directed by Nancy, who is spotted by Cobretti and Gonzales. In the ensuing shootout, Cobretti manages to kill many of the New World cultists, but Gonzales is wounded and their motel room is destroyed. Cobretti and Ingrid flee San Remos in a pickup truck, but the cultists give chase and wreck the pickup truck with a roadblock, forcing the pair to flee through a grapefruit plantation to a nearby steel mill, pursued by the Night Slasher, Nancy, and the remaining cultists. Cobretti manages to defeat the rest of the New World cultists in the steel mill, and gets Nancy accidentally killed when the Night Slasher shoots her during a struggle with Cobretti. \nThe Night Slasher fights Cobretti in vicious hand-to-hand combat, but is killed when Cobretti impales him with a large hook that drags him into a furnace, burning him alive. With the New World vanquished, the California Highway Patrol secures San Remos, and Gonzales is rescued and hospitalized. As Cobretti is cleared by his superiors, Monte arrives and initially appears apologetic, only to again chastise Cobretti for \"overdoing it\", prompting Cobretti to punch Monte in the face before he and Ingrid ride away on a motorcycle."

They also play-marry each other with Ring Pops, but are separated after Kate is adopted two weeks later.\nFive years later, a tough, overweight girl named Rasputia Latimore rescues Norbit from twin playground bullies and eventually becomes his girlfriend, but soon grows into an arrogant and tyrannical woman. They marry each other as adults, but Rasputia begins insulting and controlling him, especially accusing him of adjusting her car seat when she is driving her car. Norbit is also belittled by Rasputia's three older brothers Big Black Jack, Blue, and Earl, working as a bookkeeper at their construction company. The Latimore brothers run a \"security business\", instilling fear in the entire community except Mr. Wong, who refuses to sell them his business and does not hesitate to use his spear and pistol to intimidate them.\nAfter catching Rasputia cheating on him with her tap dance instructor Buster Perkin, Norbit calls her the \"Queen of Whores\" during their argument, which results in her chasing him through the neighborhood. Afterwards, he discards his wedding ring and vents his anger about Rasputia's infidelity at a puppet show for the orphans. He is stunned to see Kate for the first time since childhood, and his affection for her reignites as he learns she is using the money she obtained from selling her clothing business in Atlanta to purchase Mr. Wong's orphanage, but is disappointed to learn she is engaged to a man named Deion Hughes.\nAided by ex-pimp friends Pope Sweet Jesus and Lord Have Mercy and the other townspeople, Norbit meets Kate without Rasputia's knowledge and along the way, Kate teaches Norbit how to ride a bike. Deion attempts to leave town, having no intention to help Kate run the orphanage, but the Latimore brothers persuade him to help them turn the orphanage into a strip club named \"Nipplopolis\" instead and dupe Norbit into getting Kate to sign papers to renew the restaurant's liquor license in the Latimores' name. Norbit's meeting with Kate leads to helping rehearse her wedding, where a kiss between them makes her reconsider marrying Deion. Norbit returns home to learn Rasputia witnessed their kiss and threatens violence towards Kate if he ever sees her again.\nWhen Kate later learns about the deal from Deion, she goes to confront Norbit and sees him being imprisoned by Rasputia, who masterminded the orphanage plot, in their basement. Norbit reluctantly insults her and drives her away to protect her from Rasputia. Satisfied, Rasputia lies that Norbit tricked Kate since she came back to town. Heartbroken, Kate runs away and a guilt-ridden Norbit decides to permanently leave town but then finds a letter from the private investigator he hired, discovering Deion has accumulated a total of $300,000 in divorce settlements from his four marriages in the last six years to four different women.\nThe Latimores reveal their plan to Norbit, and lock him in the basement again. Norbit escapes by bike, reaching the wedding just in time to inform Kate of Deion's schemes. Though his proof of Deion's divorce settlements was destroyed after falling into a pond, Norbit reveals that he\u2019d contacted three of Deion's ex-wives and their children while he\u2019d been locked in the basement the night before, and Deion flees as they give chase, which results in the Latimores' plan backfiring.\nThe Latimores attack Norbit for sabotaging their plans, but the townspeople take up arms to protect him as his bravery has inspired them to stand up to the Latimores. Rasputia fights her way through the crowd and prepares to kill him, but Mr. Wong harpoons her in the rear, causing her to rapidly run in pain out of town. With their sister gone, the Latimore brothers finally accept defeat and are chased out of town while Norbit and Kate reconcile, purchase the orphanage, and marry under the same tree where they played as children years ago, finally living happily ever after. Rasputia and the Latimores are never seen or heard from again, but several rumors say that they moved to Mexico and open up their strip club \"El Nipplopolis\", where Rasputia becomes their most popular and lucrative stripper."

        "content": "After the success of Shrek, DreamWorks co-founder and CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg signed up Eddie Murphy to star in a live-action followup, and they were looking for the right film. Norbit seemed like a good fit, a production in line with his tradition of playing multiple characters in a comedy as Murphy had done before with Coming to America, Dr. Dolittle and The Nutty Professor. DreamWorks production president Adam Goodman brought the script to Brian Robbins and he was excited about the prospect of working with Eddie Murphy. Norbit was the first of three films where director Brian Robbins and Eddie Murphy worked together; the other two would be Meet Dave and A Thousand Words. Murphy wrote the story after going on the Internet to see videos \"where really large women, African-American women, would beat up their tiny husbands\", a concept which he found hilarious. Although Norbit was always intended to be a comedy, early drafts of the script were much darker. According to Thandie Newton, during filming, the stand-ins were very convincing, and she frequently filmed scenes with them instead of Murphy.The various prosthetic makeups, bodysuits, and wigs were created by Rick Baker and his company Cinovation. Baker praised Murphy saying \"He really makes the stuff come to life, and he never complains. When we did 'The Nutty Professor' [...], he spent 80-odd days in the makeup chair. As much as I love makeup, even I would have been complaining by the end, but Eddie didn't.\"Rick Baker wanted to work from a real life model and auditioned over a hundred extra large ladies, all with the necessary proportions. The model also needed to be able to dance. After several rounds of auditions, one lady was chosen as the life model for Rasputia and a foam latex suit was created based on her measurements. The suit's surface was painted with silicone to make it look like skin. Silicone was also used to make matching gloves. The shape of Murphy's face was changed using foam latex and pieces of silicone, which were then painted over in various tones of red, brown and yellow to create realistic looking skin tone. A body double was used for some scenes, particularly the water park. Murphy with his face in makeup as Rasputia performed against green screen and his head was digitally composited onto the body double."

It was the third and final DreamWorks Animation film co-produced with Aardman Features following Chicken Run (2000) and Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005), and was the first Aardman project mostly made in CGI animation as opposed to starting with their usual stop-motion \u2013 this was because using water on plasticine models could damage them, and it was complex to render the effect in another way. The film stars the voices of Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Ian McKellen, Shane Richie, Bill Nighy, Andy Serkis and Jean Reno. In the film, a pampered fancy rat named Roddy St. James (Jackman) is flushed down the toilet in his Kensington apartment by a sewer rat named Sid (Richie), and befriends a scavenger named Rita Malone (Winslet) in order to get back home while evading a sinister toad (McKellen) and his hench-rats (Nighy and Serkis).\nThe idea about rats that fall in love in sewers was created by animator Fell during the production of Chicken Run. In 2001, Fell developed the concept into a story before pitching it to DreamWorks. The project was first announced in July 2002, followed with comic writing duo Clement and La Frenais contracted to write the script, which had the working title Ratropolis. In 2003, Bowers joined in to direct the film with Fell.\nThe film's world premiere was held at the Toho Cinemas Theatre in Roppongi Hills during the Tokyo International Film Festival on October 22, 2006, followed by the wide release in United States by Paramount Pictures on 3 November 2006, and in the United Kingdom by UIP on 1 December. Despite receiving positive reviews from critics, Flushed Away performed poorly at the box office, prompting DreamWorks to end their partnership with Aardman and take a $109-million write-down. It grossed over $178 million worldwide against its $149 million budget. The film received nominations for the BAFTA Award and Critics' Choice Award for Best Animated Feature.

One night, while his owners are away on holiday, a sewer rat named Sid spews out of the sink's drain and decides to stay and watch the 2006 FIFA World Cup Final. Roddy attempts to get rid of Sid by flushing him down the Jacuzzi brand toilet, falsely claiming it to be an actual jacuzzi, but Sid is not fooled and flushes Roddy instead.\nRoddy finds himself in Ratropolis, a sewer city made out of various bits of junk that resembles London. He is told to seek out Rita Malone, an enterprising scavenger rat who works the drains in her faithful boat, the Jammy Dodger, who can possibly help him get home. Roddy and Rita are abducted by rats Spike and Whitey and brought before their boss, the Toad, as Rita stole back a prized ruby originally scavenged by her father. The Toad plans to have Roddy and Rita frozen with liquid nitrogen, but the pair escape. Rita takes the ruby, and a unique electric master cable required to control Ratropolis' sewer floodgates.\nRoddy deduces that the ruby is a fake and easily shatters it, enraging Rita. Roddy offers Rita a real ruby if she takes him back to Kensington, to which she agrees. The pair first stop to visit her family before setting off. During Roddy's stay, he overhears a conversation that causes him to assume that Rita is selling him out to the Toad, so he reneges on the deal and steals the Jammy Dodger. When Rita catches up to him, she is able to clear up the misunderstanding. The pair evade pursuit from Spike, Whitey, and their accomplices.\nIncensed at his minions' repeated failures, the Toad sends for his French cousin, Le Frog. It is revealed that the Toad was Prince Charles' favorite childhood pet until he was abruptly replaced by a rat and flushed down a toilet, resulting in his hatred of rodents. Le Frog and his subordinates intercept Roddy and Rita to retrieve the cable, but the duo manages to escape out of the sewer drain and back to Roddy's apartment, though the Jammy Dodger is destroyed.\nRoddy pays Rita the promised ruby and an emerald, then shows her around his apartment. She at first believes he has family, but notices his cage and realizes he is a pet and alone. Rita tries to persuade Roddy to come with her, but he is too proud to admit his loneliness and rebuffs her. Rita leaves the apartment via the toilet only for her to be kidnapped, with the Toad taking back the master cable. The distraught Roddy joins Sid to watch the game. When Sid mentions half-time, Roddy pieces together the Toad's plan: to open the floodgates during half-time of the World Cup, when all the humans will most likely be using their toilets, allowing the ensuing, enormous wave of drainage to destroy Ratropolis, allowing the Toad to use the depopulated city as a home for his tadpole children. Roddy entrusts Sid with his home and cushy position, and has Sid flush him back down the sewers again. He frees Rita, and together they defeat the Toad and his henchman by getting Toad and Le Frog's tongues stuck to moving gears and freeze the wave of drainage with liquid nitrogen. Hailed as a hero, Roddy agrees to stay in Ratropolis with Rita. Soon after, the two, as well as Rita's family, set off on the Jammy Dodger II.\nIn a post-credits scene, Sid continues to relax at his new home in Kensington. However, when Roddy's owners return, the daughter, Tabitha, finds Sid on the couch and introduces him to their new cat, much to his horror."

In 2003, David Bowers joined in to direct the film with Fell.Traditionally, Aardman had used stop-motion for their animated features, but it was complex to render water with this technique, and using real water could damage plasticine models. It would have also been expensive to composite CGI into shots that include water, of which there are many in the movie, so the company chose to make Flushed Away their first all-CGI production. This is the third and final of three Aardman-produced films released by DreamWorks. Aardman's turbulent experience with DreamWorks during the making of this film and The Curse of the Were-Rabbit led to the split between the two studios."

The answers to the outstanding questions in these stories are all hidden in the secrets from a generation ago at the now abandoned Catholic boarding school on the reservation.\nIn Story One, Ojibwe Native Americans Rain Many Lightnings O'Rourke (Georgina Lightning) and Johnny Goodfeather (Adam Beach), a teacher and a police officer have been living together for ten years, off the reservation despite Johnny's job solely out of circumstance. They have not felt ready to get married until now, Johnny asking her which coincides with his announcement that he has been accepted into the FBI training program in Washington, DC. Rain isn't sure if she is prepared to move, since her mother, Irene, has long been institutionalized in a local psychiatric institution diagnosed as schizophrenic, she inching closer to being in a vegetative state. Under this circumstance, Rain was raised by her Aunt Barbara (\"Auntie Apple\"), a devout Catholic who has long assimilated into western society and who turns to local priest Father Bartoli for any guidance. One day, after Rain swerves to avoid some children in the road and winds up in a car accident, Johnny swears there were none. What Rain eventually confides to Johnny is that she of late has been seeing visions of things she doesn't understand, she fearing that she may be going the way of her mother. She is later transferred to a psychiatric institution; when Johnny challenges Auntie Apple and tries to force his way to her, his hotheadedness gets him arrested. Rain eventually finds out the children she's been seeing running around the community are not living children, but the spirits of dead children. Through visions and investigations she discovers these unquiet dead are the little girls and boys who were murdered at the Indian boarding school that used to kidnap, institutionalize, and abuse children in the community. She realizes that the spirits of the children are speaking to her so the truth can come to light and that, maybe, the community can finally find healing.In Story Two, Luke Patterson (Bradley Cooper), a government geologist, has come to the area to investigate a reported earthquake - if it be the case, a rare earthquake - on the reservation. Beyond Johnny helping him get a city hall permit to investigate on the reservation, Luke befriends Johnny and his family during his extended stay in the area and begins to learn more about the history behind the reservation and the local boarding school from Johnny's father Pete.\nIn Story Three, Steve Klamath is running for mayor against the long time incumbent, Paul Gunderson, who has always been pro-development on the reservation. As the campaign progresses, Steve, who wants to fight for indigenous rights from the inside of the establishment, seems to be waging a losing battle both within the Native population as they historically stay home on voting day, and with the non-Native population who largely viewing him with contempt for his policies. Local radio talk show host Richard Two Rivers (Wes Studi), who is seen as the voice of the reservation, outwardly gives Steve's campaign airtime if only because it is Steve's side who contacts the radio station about the campaign, although his background shows Richard may not be who he is as perceived by the public."

Her father, who occasionally had violent outbursts, had been silent about his childhood. When Lightning was 18, her father committed suicide. This shocking event launched her on a quest, as she attempted to find out about her father's mysterious childhood. In the course of her research, she found herself visiting the Indian boarding school where her father, along with many First Nations children, had been institutionalized as a boy. She saw the large cemetery behind the school, with the names of so many young students on the headstones. From this disturbing experience, the concept for the film emerged.While the filmmaker is from Canada, the film is set in America, and was shot primarily at the Fond du Lac Indian Reservation in Minnesota. Filming took place in late 2006 on or around the Fond du Lac Reservation and Cloquet and Esko, Minnesota."

It was conceived during the hiatus between the third and fourth series of their BBC Television series Monty Python's Flying Circus.\nWhile the group's first film, And Now for Something Completely Different, was a compilation of sketches from the first two television series, Holy Grail is an original story that parodies the legend of King Arthur's quest for the Holy Grail. Thirty years later, Idle used the film as the basis for the 2005 Tony Award-winning musical Spamalot.\nMonty Python and the Holy Grail grossed more than any British film screened in the US in 1975.

        "content": "In AD 932, King Arthur and his squire, Patsy, travel Britain searching for men to join the Knights of the Round Table. Along the way, Arthur debates whether swallows could carry coconuts, passes through a town infected with the plague, recounts receiving Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake to two anarcho-syndicalist peasants, defeats the Black Knight, and observes an impromptu witch trial. He recruits Sir Bedevere the Wise, Sir Lancelot the Brave, Sir Galahad the Pure, Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot, and the aptly named Sir Not-Appearing-in-this-Film, along with their squires and Robin's minstrels. Arthur leads the knights to Camelot, but, after a musical number, changes his mind, deeming it \"a silly place\". As they turn away, God appears and orders Arthur to find the Holy Grail.\nArthur and his knights arrive at a castle occupied by French soldiers, who claim to have the Grail and taunt the Britons, driving them back with a barrage of barnyard animals. Bedevere concocts a plan to sneak in using a Trojan Rabbit, but forgets to tell the others to hide inside it; the Knights are forced to flee when it is flung back at them. Arthur decides the knights should go their separate ways to search for the Grail. \nA modern-day historian filming a documentary on the Arthurian legends is killed by an unknown knight on horseback, triggering a police investigation.\nArthur and Bedevere are given directions by an old man and attempt to satisfy the strange requests of the dreaded Knights Who Say \"Ni!\". Sir Robin avoids a fight with a Three-Headed Knight by running away while the heads are arguing among themselves. Sir Galahad is led by a grail-shaped beacon to Castle Anthrax, which is occupied exclusively by young women, who wish to be punished for misleading him, but he is unwillingly \"rescued\" by Lancelot. Lancelot receives an arrow-shot note from Swamp Castle. Believing the note is from a lady being forced to marry against her will, he storms the castle and slaughters several members of the wedding party, only to discover the note is from an effeminate prince.\nArthur and his knights regroup and are joined by Brother Maynard, his monk brethren, and three new knights: Bors, Gawain and Ector. They meet Tim the Enchanter, who directs them to a cave where the location of the Grail is said to be written. The entrance to the cave is guarded by the Rabbit of Caerbannog. Underestimating it, the knights attack, but the Rabbit easily kills Bors, Gawain and Ector. Arthur uses the \"Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch\", provided by Brother Maynard, to destroy the creature. Inside the cave, they find an inscription from Joseph of Arimathea, directing them to Castle Aarrgh.\nAn animated cave monster devours Brother Maynard, but Arthur and the knights escape after the animator unexpectedly suffers a fatal heart attack. The knights approach the Bridge of Death, where the bridge-keeper demands they answer three questions in order to pass or else be cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril. Lancelot easily answers simple questions and crosses. An overly cocky Robin is defeated by an unexpectedly difficult question, and an indecisive Galahad fails an easy one; both are magically flung into the gorge. When Arthur asks for clarification on a question regarding the airspeed of an unladen swallow, the bridge-keeper cannot answer and is himself thrown into the gorge.\nArthur and Bedevere cannot find Lancelot, unaware that he has been arrested by police investigating the historian's death. The pair reach Castle Aarrgh, but find it occupied by the French soldiers from earlier in the film. After being repelled by showers of manure, they summon an army of knights and prepare to assault the castle. As the army charges, the police arrive, arrest Arthur and Bedevere for the murder of the historian and break the camera, abruptly ending the film."

        "content": "Contemporary reviews were mixed. Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote in a favourable review that the film had \"some low spots,\" but had gags which were \"nonstop, occasionally inspired and should not be divulged, though it's not giving away too much to say that I particularly liked a sequence in which the knights, to gain access to an enemy castle, come up with the idea of building a Trojan rabbit.\" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times was also positive, writing that the film, \"like Mad comics, is not certain to please every taste. But its youthful exuberance and its rousing zaniness are hard not to like. As a matter of fact, the sense of fun is dangerously contagious.\" Penelope Gilliatt of The New Yorker called the film \"often recklessly funny and sometimes a matter of comic genius.\"Other reviews were less enthusiastic. Variety wrote that the storyline was \"basically an excuse for set pieces, some amusing, others overdone.\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two-and-a-half stars, writing that he felt \"it contained about 10 very funny moments and 70 minutes of silence. Too many of the jokes took too long to set up, a trait shared by both Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein. I guess I prefer Monty Python in chunks, in its original, television revue format.\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post called the film \"a fitfully amusing spoof of the Arthurian legends\" but \"rather poky\" in tempo, citing the running gag of Swedish subtitles in the opening credits as an example of how the Pythons \"don't know when to let go of any shtik\". Geoff Brown of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote in a mixed review that \"the team's visual buffooneries and verbal rigamaroles (some good, some bad, but mostly indifferent) are piled on top of each other with no attention to judicious timing or structure, and a form which began as a jaunty assault on the well-made revue sketch and an ingenious misuse of television's fragmented style of presentation, threatens to become as unyielding and unfruitful as the conventions it originally attacked.\"\nThe film's reputation grew over time. In 2000, readers of Total Film magazine voted Holy Grail the fifth-greatest comedy film of all time. The next Python film, Life of Brian, was ranked first. A 2006 poll of Channel 4 viewers on the 50 Greatest Comedy Films saw Holy Grail placed in sixth place (with Life of Brian again topping the list). In 2011, an ABC prime-time special, Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time, counted down the best films chosen by fans based on results of a poll conducted by ABC and People. Holy Grail was selected as the second best comedy after Airplane! In 2016, Empire magazine ranked Holy Grail 18th in their list of the 100 best British films (Life of Brian was ranked 2nd), their entry stating, \"Elvis ordered a print of this comedy classic and watched it five times. If it's good enough for the King, it's good enough for you.\"In a 2017 interview at Indiana University in Bloomington, John Cleese expressed disappointment with the film's conclusion. \"'The ending annoys me the most'\", he said after a screening of the film on the Indiana campus, adding that \"'It ends the way it does because we couldn't think of any other way'\". However, scripts for the film and notebooks that are among Michael Palin's private archive, which he donated to the British Library in 2017, do document at least one alternative ending that the troupe considered: \"a battle between the knights of Camelot, the French, and the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog\". Due to the film's small production budget, that idea for a \"much pricier option\" was discarded by the Pythons in favour of the ending with \"King Arthur getting arrested\", which Palin deemed \"cheaper\" and \"funnier\".Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes offers a 96% approval rating from reviews of 83 critics, with an average rating of 8.50/10. The consensus reads, \"A cult classic as gut-bustingly hilarious as it is blithely ridiculous, Monty Python and the Holy Grail has lost none of its exceedingly silly charm.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 91 out of 100 based on 24 critics' reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\"."

It is the third installment in the Jurassic Park franchise and the final film in the original Jurassic Park trilogy, following The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997). It is also the first film in the franchise not to be directed by Steven Spielberg, as well as the first not to be based on a novel by Michael Crichton; however, the film features characters and ideas by Crichton. Sam Neill and Laura Dern reprise their roles from the first film. New cast members include William H. Macy, T\u00e9a Leoni, Alessandro Nivola, Trevor Morgan, and Michael Jeter. The plot follows a divorced couple who deceive paleontologist Alan Grant into helping them find their son, who has gone missing on Isla Sorna.\nAfter the release of Spielberg's Jurassic Park, Joe Johnston expressed interest in directing a sequel, which Spielberg agreed to. Universal Pictures announced the third film in June 1998, with a release scheduled for mid-2000. A draft written by Peter Buchman was rejected five weeks ahead of filming in favor of a simpler story idea suggested by David Koepp, the writer of the previous two films. Payne and Taylor were hired to rewrite the earlier script by Buchman, who made further revisions to their draft. Filming lasted five months, beginning in Hawaii in August 2000, before moving to California. A final draft of the script was never completed during production, a circumstance Johnston considered quitting over. Jurassic Park III features a combination of computer-generated and animatronic dinosaurs. A Spinosaurus replaces the Tyrannosaurus, from the previous two films as the main dinosaur antagonist.\nJurassic Park III premiered on July 16, 2001, and was theatrically released on July 18. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film was a box-office success, grossing $368.8 million worldwide against a $93 million budget, becoming so the eighth highest-grossing film of 2001; however, it is the lowest-grossing installment in the franchise to date. In 2015, it was followed by Jurassic World, which would start the sequel trilogy of the same name. Sam Neill and Laura Dern would later reprise their roles as Alan Grant and  Ellie Sattler   in Jurassic World Dominion (2022)"

As the boat enters a thick fog, the crew is killed by an unknown attacker, prompting Ben to detach the line before the vessel crashes into rocks. Eric and Ben drift towards the island.\nEight weeks later, paleontologist Alan Grant struggles to secure funding for his Velociraptor research and rebuffs the public's obsession with the events on Isla Nublar. Grant discusses his research with longtime colleague Ellie Sattler, hypothesizing that Velociraptors were intellectually and socially advanced beyond even primates. In Montana, his assistant, Billy Brennan, uses a three-dimensional printer to replicate a Velociraptor larynx.\nPaul and Amanda Kirby, a seemingly wealthy couple, offer to fund Grant's research if he gives them an illegal aerial tour of Isla Sorna. Grant reluctantly agrees, flying there with Billy, two of the Kirbys' mercenary associates, Udesky and Cooper, and their pilot, M.B. Nash. Grant learns that the Kirbys intend to land; he protests, but Cooper knocks him unconscious. Grant awakens to find that the group has landed, although they reboard the plane when a large theropod approaches the runway, leaving Cooper behind. During takeoff, the creature, revealed to be a Spinosaurus, emerges and devours Cooper. The aircraft hits the dinosaur and crashes into the trees. The Spinosaurus then attacks the plane and eats Nash, who has Paul's satellite phone. The survivors flee, only to encounter a Tyrannosaurus. The two dinosaurs fight and the Spinosaurus defeats it as the humans escape.\nGrant furiously confronts the Kirbys, who reveal they are a middle-class divorced couple, searching for their son Eric and Amanda's boyfriend Ben. Government agencies declined to help, so they deceived Grant and brought him along, mistakenly believing him to have experience on Isla Sorna. The group begins searching for Eric and Ben, as they travel to the coast. They find Ben's skeletal remains attached to the parasail, which Billy takes. They also stumble upon some Velociraptor nests, during which Billy secretly secures a pair of eggs.\nThey soon discover an InGen compound, where a Velociraptor ambushes them, before vocalizing for its pack. The humans escape within a herd of Corythosaurus and Parasaurolophus, causing a stampede; Grant and Udesky become separated from the others, who take refuge in the trees. The Velociraptors injure Udesky and thus attempt to lure Paul, Amanda and Billy into rescuing him; their trap is unsuccessful and they soon kill Udesky. Elsewhere, Grant observes the pack communicating, and suspects that they are searching for something; as he tries to slip away, they ambush him. Eric appears, dispersing the attack with canisters of tear gas, before taking Grant to an overturned supply truck where he has been taking shelter. The following morning, they reunite with Billy and the Kirbys before narrowly escaping from the Spinosaurus again.\nGrant, wary of Billy, checks his bag and sees the Velociraptor eggs, which Billy says he planned to sell to fund the dig site. Grant decides to keep the eggs, hoping the Velociraptors may spare the group if the eggs are returned. The group enters an aviary, which they realize is occupied by Pteranodons. A flock attacks the group and flies away with Eric. Billy rescues him using the parasail; the flock then attacks Billy, who is seemingly killed. Boarding a barge, the group escapes the aviary but unintentionally leaves the cage unlocked. That night, they retrieve the ringing satellite phone from the excrement of the Spinosaurus. Grant contacts Ellie for help, but the Spinosaurus attacks them. Fuel from the boat leaks into the water and Grant ignites it using a flare gun, driving the Spinosaurus away.\nThe following day, the group hears the sound of the ocean and arrives at the coast, but they are ambushed by the Velociraptors, who have come for the eggs. Grant uses the replica larynx to confuse the pack into thinking more of their troops need help. Upon hearing distant helicopters, the raptors spare the group and reclaim their eggs before disappearing into the jungle. U.S. Marines and Navy, summoned by Ellie, land on the beach and rescue the survivors. On a military helicopter, they discover that Billy has also been rescued. They watch the now-freed Pteranodons fly alongside them as they leave the island."

Spielberg had no intention of returning to the Jurassic Park series as a director, stating that the films were difficult to make.

The first footage from the film was aired during the second-season finale of Survivor in May 2001, and the official website went online at the end of June. Promotional partners included Kodak and the Coca-Cola Company. No fast-food promotions took place in the United States, although children's meal toys based on the film were offered in Canadian Burger King outlets.A novelization by Scott Ciencin, aimed at young children, was published, as well. Ciencin also wrote three children's books to tie in with the film's events: Jurassic Park Adventures: Survivor, the first book, details the eight weeks Eric spent alone on Isla Sorna; Jurassic Park Adventures: Prey has Eric and Alan returning to Isla Sorna to rescue a group of teenage filmmakers; and Jurassic Park Adventures: Flyers involves Eric and Alan leading the Pteranodon home after they nest in a Universal Studios theme park.In early 2001, Hasbro released a line of 3.5-inch (89 mm) action figures including electronic dinosaurs, humans, and vehicles, to coincide with the film's release. The figures were scaled down from the original Kenner action figures from the pre-Jurassic Park III toy lines. A line of toys were also released through the Lego Studios brand. Playskool released a line of toys called Jurassic Park Junior, which were aimed at young children. A smaller line of die-cast toys and a range of clothes were also produced. In November 2001, to promote the film's impending home media release, Universal launched a viral marketing website for Isla Travel, a fictional Isla Sorna travel agency."

Starring Toshiro Mifune, Machiko Ky\u014d, Masayuki Mori, and Takashi Shimura as various people who describe how a samurai was murdered in a forest, the plot and characters are based upon Ryunosuke Akutagawa's short story \"In a Grove\", with the title and framing story being based on \"Rash\u014dmon\", another short story by Akutagawa. Every element is largely identical, from the murdered samurai speaking through a Shinto psychic to the bandit in the forest, the monk, the assault of the wife and the dishonest retelling of the events in which everyone shows their ideal self by lying.The film is known for a plot device that involves various characters providing subjective, alternative and contradictory versions of the same incident. Rashomon was the first Japanese film to receive a significant international reception; it won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1951, was given an Academy Honorary Award at the 24th Academy Awards in 1952, and is considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Rashomon effect is named after the film."

        "content": "In Heian-era Kyoto, a woodcutter and a priest, taking shelter from a downpour under the Rash\u014dmon city gate, recount a story of a recent assault and murder. Baffled at the existence of conflicting accounts of the same event, the woodcutter and the priest are joined by a commoner. The woodcutter claims he had found the body of a murdered samurai three days earlier, alongside the samurai's cap, his wife's hat, cut pieces of rope, and an amulet. The priest claims he had seen the samurai travel with his wife on the day of the murder. Both testify in court before a policeman presents the main suspect, a captured bandit named Taj\u014dmaru.\nIn Taj\u014dmaru's version of events, he follows the couple after spotting them traveling in the woods. He tricks the samurai into leaving the trail by lying about finding a burial pit filled with ancient artifacts. He subdues the samurai and attempts to rape his wife, who tries to defend herself with a dagger. Taj\u014dmaru then seduces the wife, who, ashamed of the dishonor of having been with two men, asks Taj\u014dmaru to duel her husband so she may go with the man who wins. Taj\u014dmaru agrees; the duel ends with Taj\u014dmaru killing the samurai. He then finds the wife has fled.\nThe wife, having been found by the police, delivers different testimony; in her version of events, Taj\u014dmaru leaves immediately after assaulting her. She frees her husband from his bonds, but he stares at her with contempt and loathing. The wife tries to threaten him with her dagger but then faints from panic. She awakens to find her husband dead, with the dagger in his chest. In shock, she wanders through the forest until coming upon a pond and attempts to drown herself but fails.\nThe samurai's testimony is heard through a medium. In his version of events, Taj\u014dmaru asks the wife to marry him after the assault. To the samurai's shame, she accepts, asking Taj\u014dmaru to kill the samurai first. This disgusts Taj\u014dmaru, who gives the samurai the choice to let her go or have her killed. The wife then breaks free and flees. Taj\u014dmaru unsuccessfully gives chase. After being set free by an apologetic Taj\u014dmaru, the samurai kills himself with the dagger. Later, he feels someone remove the dagger from his chest, but cannot tell who.\nThe woodcutter proclaims that all three stories are falsehoods and admits that he saw the samurai killed by a sword instead of a dagger. The commoner pressures the woodcutter to admit that he had seen the murder but lied to avoid getting in trouble. In the woodcutter's version of events, Taj\u014dmaru begs the wife to marry him. She instead frees her husband, expecting him to kill Taj\u014dmaru. The samurai refuses to fight, unwilling to risk his life for a ruined woman. Taj\u014dmaru rescinds his promise to marry the wife; the wife rebukes them both for failing to keep their promises. The two men unwillingly enter into a duel; the samurai is disarmed and begs for his life, and Taj\u014dmaru kills him. The wife flees, and Taj\u014dmaru steals the samurai's sword and limps away.\nThe woodcutter, the priest and the commoner are interrupted by the sound of a crying baby. They find a child abandoned in a basket along with a kimono and an amulet; the commoner steals the items, for which he is rebuked by the woodcutter. The commoner deduces that the woodcutter had lied not because he feared getting in trouble, but because he had stolen the wife's dagger to sell for food.\nMeanwhile, the priest attempts to soothe the baby. The woodcutter attempts to take the child after the commoner's departure; the priest, having lost his faith in humanity after the events of the trial and the commoner's actions, recoils. The woodcutter explains that he intends to raise the child. Having seen the woodcutter's well-meaning intentions, the priest announces that his faith in men has been restored. As the woodcutter prepares to leave, the rain stops and the clouds part, revealing the sun."

        "content": "The film depicts the rape of a woman and the murder of her samurai husband through the widely differing accounts of four witnesses, including the bandit-rapist, the wife, the dead man (speaking through a medium), and lastly the woodcutter, the one witness who seems the most objective and least biased. The stories are mutually contradictory and even the final version may be seen as motivated by factors of ego and saving face. The actors kept approaching Kurosawa wanting to know the truth, and he claimed the point of the film was to be an exploration of multiple realities rather than an exposition of a particular truth. Later film and television use of the \"Rashomon effect\" focuses on revealing \"the truth\" in a now conventional technique that presents the final version of a story as the truth, an approach that only matches Kurosawa's film on the surface.\nDue to its emphasis on the subjectivity of truth and the uncertainty of factual accuracy, Rashomon has been read by some as an allegory of the defeat of Japan at the end of World War II. James F. Davidson's article, \"Memory of Defeat in Japan: A Reappraisal of Rashomon\" in the December 1954 issue of the Antioch Review, is an early analysis of the World War II defeat elements. Another allegorical interpretation of the film is mentioned briefly in a 1995 article, \"Japan: An Ambivalent Nation, an Ambivalent Cinema\" by David M. Desser. Here, the film is seen as an allegory of the atomic bomb and Japanese defeat. It also briefly mentions James Goodwin's view on the influence of post-war events on the film. However, \"In a Grove\" (the short story by Akutagawa that the film is based on) was published already in 1922, so any postwar allegory would have been the result of Kurosawa's editing rather than the story about the conflicting accounts. Historian and critic David Conrad has noted that the use of rape as a plot point came at a time when American occupation authorities had recently stopped censoring Japanese media and belated accounts of rapes by occupation troops began to appear in Japanese newspapers. Moreover, Kurosawa and other filmmakers had not been allowed to make jidaigeki during the early part of the occupation, so setting a film in the distant past was a way to reassert domestic control over cinema."

Written by Sidney Gilliat and Frank Launder, based on the 1936 novel The Wheel Spins by Ethel Lina White, the film is about an English tourist travelling by train in continental Europe who discovers that her elderly travelling companion seems to have disappeared from the train. After her fellow passengers deny ever having seen the elderly lady, the young woman is helped by a young musicologist, the two proceeding to search the train for clues to the old lady's disappearance.\nThe Lady Vanishes was filmed at the Gainsborough Studios in Islington, London. Hitchcock caught Hollywood's attention with the film and moved to Hollywood soon after its release. Although the director's three previous efforts had done poorly at the box office, The Lady Vanishes was widely successful, and confirmed American producer David O. Selznick's belief that Hitchcock indeed had a future in Hollywood cinema.The British Film Institute ranked The Lady Vanishes the 35th best British film of the 20th century. In 2017, a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for Time Out magazine saw it ranked the 31st best British film ever. It is one of Hitchcock's most renowned British films, and the first of three screen versions of White's novel as of January 2021."

The stranded passengers are forced to spend the night at a hotel. In the same predicament are Charters and Caldicott, cricket enthusiasts anxious to see the last days of a Test match in Manchester, and Miss Froy, a governess and music teacher. Miss Froy listens to a folk singer in the street, but he is strangled to death by an unseen murderer.\nThat evening, Iris is bothered by a loud noise from the room above hers. It is caused by Gilbert Redman, an ethnomusicologist who plays the clarinet for local folk dancers. She attempts to get him removed from the room, but fails after he confronts her.\nThe next morning at the railway station, Iris is attempting to return Miss Froy's glasses when she is hit on the head by a large planter dropped from above. Miss Froy helps her onto the train. Also on board are Charters and Caldicott, Gilbert, lawyer Eric Todhunter and his mistress, who is passing herself off as \"Mrs. Todhunter.\" Iris faints and then comes to in a compartment with Miss Froy and several strangers. She joins Miss Froy in the dining car for tea. Soon after, they return to their compartment, where Iris falls asleep.\nWhen Iris wakes up, Miss Froy has vanished, and the other passengers in the compartment and some of the train staff deny having seen her. Todhunter pretends not to remember her to avoid drawing attention to his liaison with his mistress. Iris searches for Miss Froy with Gilbert's assistance. Brain surgeon Dr. Hartz says Iris may be suffering from \"concussion-related hallucinations.\" Fearing that any delay would make them miss the cricket match, Charters and Caldicott also claim not to remember Miss Froy. \n\nAngry at her lover for his reluctance to pursue a divorce, Todhunter's mistress admits to seeing Miss Froy. At the first stop, Dr. Hartz's patient, whose head is completely covered in bandages, is brought aboard on a stretcher and accompanied by an apparently deaf-mute nun. A woman dressed exactly like Miss Froy, Madame Kummer, appears in her place and claims to have helped Iris after she was struck on the head. Now concerned about potential scandal, Todhunter's mistress says Madame Kummer was the woman she saw. Waiting in the corridor while one of the cooks tosses trash out the window, Gilbert sees a wrapper from Miss Froy's personal tea package, which briefly sticks to a window, convincing him of her existence. \nWhile continuing their search, Iris and Gilbert find Miss Froy's glasses in the baggage car. However, they are attacked by magician Signor Doppo who was in Iris's compartment. They lose the glasses in the struggle and Doppo escapes. Iris notices that the nun accompanying Dr. Hartz's patient is wearing high heels, and they suspect that patient has been replaced by Miss Froy. Dr. Hartz shares a drink with them in the dining car and takes them back to a compartment, where he admits that he is involved in the conspiracy and tells them they have been drugged. However the false nun, revealed to be a British woman in costume, did not put the drug into their drinks out of loyalty to her fellow countrymen. Gilbert and Iris escape, free Miss Froy and replace her with Madame Kummer.\nWhen the train stops near the border, Dr. Hartz discovers the switch. He has part of the train diverted onto a branch line, where soldiers wait. Gilbert and Iris inform their fellow passengers what is happening. A uniformed soldier boards and requests that they all accompany him. They knock him out and take his pistol. Another soldier fires, wounding Charters in the hand.\nDuring the ensuing gunfight, Miss Froy tells Gilbert and Iris that she must get away as she is actually a spy. Just in case, she gives them a message (encoded in a tune) to deliver to the Foreign Office in Whitehall\u2014the same tune that the murdered street musician performed for her. Miss Froy then runs into the forest, and those on the train are not sure whether or not she is shot. Todhunter attempts to surrender, waving a white handkerchief, and is shot dead. Gilbert and Caldicott commandeer the locomotive, but the knocked out soldier wakes up and threatens the rest of the guests. The false nun escapes through a side door and switches the tracks but is shot in the leg; however, Caldicott and Gilbert manage to pull her up into the train before she is left behind.\nIn London, Charters and Caldicott discover the Test Match has been cancelled due to flooding. Seeing her fianc\u00e9 from a distance, Iris jumps into a cab with Gilbert, who kisses her. They arrive at the Foreign Office, but in the waiting room Gilbert realizes he cannot remember the vital tune. As they are led into the office, Gilbert and Iris hear it. The doors open, revealing Miss Froy playing the tune on a piano."

It is Antonioni's first entirely English-language film and stars David Hemmings, Vanessa Redgrave and Sarah Miles. Also featured was 1960s model Veruschka. The plot was inspired by Argentine writer Julio Cort\u00e1zar's 1959 short story \"Las babas del diablo\".The story is set within the contemporary mod subculture of Swinging London, and follows a fashion photographer (Hemmings) who believes he has unwittingly captured a murder on film. The screenplay was by Antonioni and Tonino Guerra, with English dialogue by British playwright Edward Bond. The cinematographer was Carlo di Palma. The film's non-diegetic music was scored by American jazz pianist Herbie Hancock, and the English rock group The Yardbirds are seen performing \"Stroll On\".\nIn the main competition section of the 1967 Cannes Film Festival, Blow-Up won the Palme d'Or, the festival's highest honour. The American release of the counterculture-era film with its explicit sexual content defied Hollywood's Production Code, and its subsequent critical and commercial success influenced the abandonment of the code in 1968 in favour of the MPAA film rating system.Blow-Up would influence subsequent films, including Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation (1974) and Brian De Palma's Blow Out (1981). In 2012, Blow-Up was ranked No. 144 in the Sight & Sound critics' poll of the world's greatest films."

He grows bored and walks off, leaving the models and production staff in the lurch. As he leaves the studio, two teenage aspiring models ask to speak to him, but he brushes them off and drives off to visit an antique shop.\nWandering into Maryon Park, Thomas furtively takes photographs of two lovers. The woman, Jane, is furious at being photographed and pursues Thomas, demanding his film and attempting to take his camera. He refuses, and continues to photograph her as she runs away through the park. Thomas then meets his agent Ron for lunch and notices a man following him and looking into his car. Back at his studio, Jane arrives, asking desperately for the film. She and Thomas have a conversation and flirt, but he deliberately hands her a different roll of film. She, in turn, gives him a false telephone number.\nThomas makes several blow-ups of the film of Jane and her lover, which reveal Jane worriedly looking at a third person lurking in the trees with a pistol. Thomas excitedly calls Ron, claiming that his impromptu photo session may have saved a man's life. Thomas is then disturbed by a knock on the door. It is the two teenage girls again, with whom he has a sexual encounter in his studio before falling asleep. After awakening, he learns that the girls hope he will photograph them, but realises that there may be more to the photograph in the park. He tells them to leave, saying, \"Tomorrow! Tomorrow!\"\nFurther examination of a blurred figure on the ground under a bush in one of the blow-ups makes Thomas suspect the man in the park may have been murdered after all. As evening falls, Thomas goes back to the park and finds the body, but he has not brought his camera and is scared off by the sound of a twig breaking. Thomas returns to his studio to find it ransacked, with all of the negatives and prints gone except for one very grainy blow-up of what is possibly the body.\nAfter driving into town, he sees Jane and follows her into the Ricky-Tick club, where The Yardbirds are performing the song \"Stroll On\". A buzz in guitarist Jeff Beck's amplifier angers him so much that he smashes his guitar on stage and then throws its neck into the crowd. The crowd, previously disengaged, fights over the guitar neck. Thomas grabs the neck and runs out of the club before anyone can snatch it from him; once he is away from the crowd chasing him, he tosses it onto the pavement and walks away. A passer-by picks up the neck but leaves it on the pavement, not realising its significance.\nAt a drug-drenched party in a house on the Thames, Thomas finds Veruschka, who had told him that she was going to Paris; when confronted, she says she is in Paris. Thomas asks a cannabis-addled Ron to come to the park as a witness, but cannot convince him of what has happened. Instead, Thomas joins the party and wakes up in a bedroom of the house at sunrise. He returns to the park alone, only to find that the body is gone.\nThomas watches a mime troupe perform a mock-tennis match at the park, and picks up the imaginary ball and throws it back to the two players when asked. As he watches the mimes continue to play, the sound of the ball being played is heard and his image fades away, leaving only the grass."

        "content": "Antonioni's screenplay for Blow-Up is a \"thriller-suspense\" story revolving around the efforts of a young and successful fashion photographer in his struggle to determine whether a series of snapshots he takes at a public park contain evidence of a murder. As Thomas persists in his role as amateur detective, his quest leads him initially to question his technical mastery over the \"hidden truth\" recorded by his camera, then toward a confrontation with the realities of his life\u2014a life of \"material advantages, gained at the expense of ideals\". Finally, the conflicted young man questions the reality of his own existence. Film historian Gordon Gow identifies the object in Antonioni's use of suspense: \n\n\"In the case of Blow-Up, the mystery [i.e. whether a murder took place] is relevant to the film, but the solution of it is not. Indeed, the absence of a solution is part of the point: life's uncertainty...the true suspense resides not in the mystery of the photographic blow-ups, but in the instability of Thomas himself.\"\nIn an interview at the time of the film's release, Antonioni stated that the film \"is not about man's relationship with man, it is about man's relationship with reality\". Indeed, Gow observes that \"a mystery without a solution is instrumental to the theme of disorientation in Antonioni's Blow-up.The theme of uncertainty is sustained until the final moments of the Blow-Up, when Thomas attempts to resolve the contradictions and ambiguities that arise from his investigations and from his own life, but fails to integrate them.In the final sequence of Blow-Up, a \"garishly attired\" mime troupe arrives at the park, escapees from the real world. Thomas joins them in their fantasy play, and like the non-existent ball he \"sees\" during the troupes' faux match, he dissolves from view: \"As a creature of the factual world, he no longer exists.\" Thomas' fate is known and the audience's suspense is resolved, but Antonioni leaves the meaning of the film open to speculation.Gordon Gow considers alternate interpretations for the film's ending:\n\n\"Since Blow-Up is not resolved happily, but rather in a total surrender to fantasy and consequently to oblivion, we can take it either as an exhortation to come to terms with reality, or as a cautionary tale in which the pursuit of material gain is a threat to humanity.\""

In an interview Sterling Morrison of The Velvet Underground claimed that Antonioni had also asked the Velvet Underground to appear in the film, and the band members were \"more than willing\", but due to the expense of flying the Velvets over from the US, Antonioni instead decided on an English group.

        "content": "Vietnam War veteran John Rambo goes to a lake house looking for an old comrade, only to learn his friend died of cancer over a year earlier, brought on by exposure to Agent Orange during the war. He offers his condolences to the soldier's widow for her loss and gives her a photo of the pair and the rest of their unit, Baker Team.\nContinuing his travels, Rambo reaches the town of Hope, Washington. The sheriff, Will Teasle, heads him off and drives him to the outskirts of town, explaining that he considers his job to keep drifters out of Hope. Neglecting the sheriff's warning, Rambo returns to Hope, prompting Teasle to arrest Rambo on charges of vagrancy, resisting arrest, and possessing a concealed knife. Led by the sadistic chief deputy Art Galt, Teasle's deputies abuse Rambo, triggering flashbacks of the torture he endured in Vietnam. When they try to dry shave him with a straight razor, Rambo snaps, fights his way out of the sheriff's station, regains his knife, and flees on a motorcycle into the woods. Teasle organizes a search party with rifles, dogs, and a helicopter.\nDefying Teasle's orders, Galt attempts to shoot Rambo from the helicopter. Cornered on a high cliff, Rambo leaps into a tree, injuring his right arm. With Galt still shooting at him, Rambo throws a rock at the helicopter, cracking its windshield and causing the pilot to briefly lose control. Losing his balance, Galt falls to his death on the jagged rocks. Rambo tries to surrender to Teasle, reasoning that Galt's death was an accident and that he wants no more trouble, but the deputies shoot at him, and he flees. Other deputies warn Teasle that Rambo is a lethal Green Beret, war hero, and Medal of Honor recipient, but Teasle swears revenge and continues the search.\nUsing booby traps and his bare hands, Rambo kills the dogs and non-lethally subdues all the deputies and captures Teasle, holding a knife to his throat and threatening war if he does not give up the pursuit, before retreating further into the woods. The Washington State Patrol and Washington National Guard are dispatched to assist Teasle, along with Rambo's mentor and former commanding officer, Colonel Sam Trautman. Trautman advises that Rambo should be allowed to escape to the next town to defuse the situation, then be permitted to surrender peacefully later, but Teasle, confident that Rambo is hopelessly outnumbered, refuses. Teasle allows Trautman to contact Rambo to persuade him to surrender, but Rambo refuses, condemning Teasle and his deputies for their abuse and citing that they \"drew first blood\".\nAt the entrance of an abandoned mine, a National Guard detachment corners Rambo. Ignoring Teasle's instructions to wait for his arrival, the guardsmen fire a rocket launcher, collapsing the entrance and seemingly killing Rambo. Rambo survives and, finding a way out, hijacks a military truck carrying an M60 machine gun and ammunition and returns to Hope to cause as much damage as possible. In an effort to distract the authorities, Rambo blows up a gas station, cuts power to most of the town, destroys a sporting goods store, and shoots up the sheriff's station. Trautman, understanding that Teasle is outmatched, tries again to convince him to leave Rambo be; Teasle ignores his orders and tries to hunt for Rambo on the station's roof, but is shot and wounded by him.\nAs Rambo prepares to kill Teasle, Trautman appears and warns Rambo that he will be killed unless he surrenders, reminding him that he is the last survivor of Baker Team. Rambo vents about the horrors of war and his traumatic experiences\u2014watching his friends die in Vietnam, being treated poorly when returning home, being unable to hold a job, and being forgotten despite his sacrifices\u2014and breaks down crying as he recounts how a good friend was killed by a Viet Cong child soldier using a shoeshiner box wired with explosives. After being comforted by Trautman, Rambo surrenders and is taken into federal custody, while Teasle is taken to a waiting ambulance for transport to the hospital."

The film was shot in Shanghai and at other locations in China. RZA and Howard Drossin composed the film's musical score, and RZA produced its soundtrack, which featured several new songs by various artists. A series of concerts featuring music from the soundtrack were held to promote the film.\nThe film was released in North America on November 2, 2012. Critics were divided over the film's homage to martial arts films, considering it well-choreographed and representative of the genre, but offering nothing original, and the direction was criticized for a lack of refinement.

        "content": "In 19th-century China, Jungle Village is home to several warring clans. The village blacksmith creates deadly weapons for the clans, intending to use his payments to purchase the freedom of his lover Lady Silk, and leave the village. The region's governor tasks the Lion Clan's leader, Gold Lion, with protecting a large shipment of gold that must pass through the village. Gold is betrayed by his lieutenants Silver Lion and Bronze Lion, who plan to steal the gold. They use the chaos ensuing from a fight with the Hyena Clan to allow their co-conspirator Poison Dagger\u2014the governor's aide\u2014to assassinate Gold, after which Silver becomes the Lions' leader. Gold's son Zen-Yi learns of his father's murder and sets off to the village to seek revenge.\nThe Qing Emperor's undercover emissary Jack Knife arrives in the village to monitor the gold and takes up residence in the Pink Blossom, a brothel run by Madam Blossom, Lady Silk's madame. Silver sends members of the Rodent clan to kill Zen-Yi before he can reach the village, but Zen-Yi kills them. The mercenary Brass Body arrives in the village and meets with Silver; he is sent to kill Zen-Yi. The blacksmith meets with Silk in the brothel and delivers the final payment needed to free her. After arriving in the village, Zen-Yi and his men are confronted by Brass and find that they cannot physically harm him because his skin turns to metal on impact. Brass beats Zen-Yi and destroys his blade-laden armor. Zen-Yi's last surviving man sacrifices himself to pull a canopy support beam loose, burying Brass under heavy stone. The blacksmith is watching the fight; he rescues Zen-Yi and helps him recover as penance for crafting the weapon that killed Zen-Yi's father.\nMeanwhile, the gold shipment arrives in the village, accompanied by two skilled warriors, the Geminis. The Lions soon confront the Geminis and their men, and in the ensuing fight, Poison Dagger assassinates the Geminis and the Lions capture the gold. Jack later arrives to investigate the incident and learns that the Geminis were poisoned with mercury-tipped weapons, leading him to the blacksmith. The Lions' theft prompts the governor to send his Jackal troops to recover the shipment or destroy the village. Zen-Yi asks the blacksmith to craft him a new suit of weaponized armor. The Lions suspect that the blacksmith is helping Zen-Yi and have him tortured for information. The blacksmith refuses to talk, and Brass cuts off his forearms. Jack, who had been following the blacksmith, saves him from bleeding to death. While the blacksmith recovers, he tells Jack of his past as an emancipated American slave who accidentally killed a white man who refused to let him go. He fled America by boat and went to China, where monks trained him to use his body's energy to perform superhuman feats. Jack with the aid of the blacksmith crafts his greatest weapon: a pair of iron forearms that he can animate using this energy.\nZen-Yi recovers and joins Jack and the blacksmith. Meanwhile, Blossom offers to let Silver hide the gold in a secret tomb beneath the brothel in return for payment. The gold is stored in a coffin which is raised up to the rafters. That night, Blossom has her girls serve the Lions, and Silk serves Brass. At Blossom's signal, the girls use weapons hidden in their mouths to poison many of the Lions, and they join with Blossom as the Black Widows. When Silk tries to poison Brass, his skin protects him, and he beats and almost kills her. Zen-Yi, Jack, and the blacksmith arrive and join with the Black Widows to fight the remaining Lions while Blossom and Bronze fight and kill each other. While fighting Jack, Poison Dagger is crushed to death between large moving gears. Silver and Zen-Yi fight in the tomb; Zen-Yi cuts the coffin free and it crushes Silver, killing him. The blacksmith finds Silk, who dies in his arms. He confronts Brass, and his iron fists prove capable of inflicting damage on Brass' seemingly invincible body. While Brass is in metal form, a powerful punch from the blacksmith shatters him to pieces. Jack runs outside in time to stop the soldiers from decimating the building with Gatling guns.\nUltimately, Jack leaves the village to accompany the gold, and Zen-Yi tells the blacksmith that he has gained a brother. With the clans destroyed and the village safe, the blacksmith vows to keep it that way and destroys the sign pointing to his weapon shop. During the credits, Zen-Yi's pregnant fianc\u00e9e is kidnapped by a bird clan, prompting Zen-Yi to seek the blacksmith's aid."

        "content": "The Wizard of Oz is a 1939 American musical fantasy film produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). An adaptation of L. Frank Baum's 1900 children's fantasy novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, it was primarily directed by Victor Fleming, who left production to take over the troubled Gone with the Wind. It  stars Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, Billie Burke and Margaret Hamilton. Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf received credit for the screenplay, while others made uncredited contributions. The music was composed by Harold Arlen and adapted by Herbert Stothart, with lyrics by Edgar \"Yip\" Harburg.\nThe Wizard of Oz is celebrated for its use of Technicolor, fantasy storytelling, musical score, and memorable characters. It was a critical success and was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning Best Original Song for \"Over the Rainbow\" and Best Original Score for Stothart; an Academy Juvenile Award was presented to Judy Garland. While the film was sufficiently popular at the box office, it failed to make a profit for MGM until its 1949 re-release, earning only $3 million on a $2.7 million budget, making it MGM's most expensive production at the time.The 1956 television broadcast premiere of the film on CBS reintroduced the film to the public. According to the U.S. Library of Congress, it is the most seen film in movie history. In 1989, it was selected by the Library of Congress as one of the first 25 films for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\"; it is also one of the few films on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register. The film was ranked second in Variety's inaugural 100 Greatest Movies of All Time list published in 2022. It was among the top ten in the 2005 BFI (British Film Institute) list of \"50 films to be seen by the age of 14\" and is on the BFI's updated list of \"50 films to be seen by the age of 15\" released in May 2020. The Wizard of Oz has become the source of many quotes referenced in contemporary popular culture. The film frequently ranks on critics' lists of the greatest films of all time and is the most commercially successful adaptation of Baum's work."

When Dorothy's Cairn Terrier Toto bites the wealthy Almira Gulch, Gulch obtains a sheriff's order authorizing her to seize the dog to be destroyed. Toto escapes and returns to Dorothy, who runs away to protect him. Professor Marvel, a charlatan fortune-teller, persuades Dorothy to go home because Aunt Em is heartbroken. She returns just as a tornado approaches the farm. Unable to get into the locked storm shelter, Dorothy takes cover in the farmhouse and is knocked unconscious as the tornado lifts the house and drops it intact onto an unknown land.\nDorothy awakens and is greeted by a good witch named Glinda, who floats down in a pink bubble and explains she is in Munchkinland in the land of Oz, and that the Munchkins are celebrating because the house landed on the Wicked Witch of the East. Her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West, appears in a puff of smoke; before she can seize her deceased sister's ruby slippers, Glinda magically transports them onto Dorothy's feet and tells her to keep them on, as they must be powerful if the Wicked Witch wants them so badly. Because the Wicked Witch has no power in Munchkinland, she leaves in another puff of smoke, but not before telling Dorothy, \"I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog too!\" Glinda recommends Dorothy follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City, the home of the Wizard of Oz, as he might know how to help her return home.\nAlong the way, Dorothy meets the Scarecrow, who wants a brain; the Tin Man, who wants a heart; and the Cowardly Lion, who wants courage. The group reaches the Emerald City, despite the efforts of the Wicked Witch. Dorothy is initially denied an audience with the Wizard by his guard, but the guard relents due to Dorothy's grief, and the four are led into the Wizard's chambers. The Wizard appears as a giant ghostly head and tells them he will grant their wishes if they bring him the Wicked Witch's broomstick.\nDuring their quest, Dorothy and Toto are captured by flying monkeys and taken to the Wicked Witch, but the ruby slippers protect her and Toto manages to escape, leading the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion to the castle. They free Dorothy, but are pursued and finally cornered by the Witch and her guards. The Witch toys with them, setting fire to the Scarecrow. When Dorothy throws a bucket of water onto the Scarecrow, she inadvertently splashes the Witch, causing her to melt away.\nThe Witch's guards gratefully give Dorothy her broomstick, and the four return to the Wizard, but he tells them to return tomorrow. When Toto pulls back a curtain, the \"Wizard\" is revealed to be an ordinary man operating machinery that projects the ghostly image of his face. The four travelers confront the Wizard, who insists that he is a good man at heart, but confesses to being a humbug. He then \"grants\" the wishes of Dorothy's three friends by giving them tokens to confirm that they have the qualities they sought.\nThe Wizard reveals that he, like Dorothy, is from Kansas and accidentally arrived in Oz in a hot air balloon. When he offers to take Dorothy back to Kansas with him aboard his balloon, she accepts, but Toto jumps off and Dorothy goes after him, and the balloon accidentally lifts off with just the Wizard aboard. Glinda reappears and tells Dorothy she always had the power to return to Kansas using the ruby slippers, but had to find that out for herself. After sharing a tearful farewell with her friends, Dorothy heeds Glinda's instructions by tapping her heels three times and repeating the words \"There's no place like home.\" \nDorothy is transported back to Kansas, where she awakens in her own bed. Aunt Em attends to her while Uncle Henry and the farm hands stand by. Professor Marvel stops in as Dorothy describes Oz, telling the farm hands and the Professor they were there too, and they smile, humoring her. As Dorothy hugs Toto, she gratefully exclaims, \"Oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home!\""

        "content": "Arnold Gillespie, the film's special effects director, employed several techniques. Developing the tornado scene was especially costly. Gillespie used muslin cloth to make the tornado flexible, after a previous attempt with rubber failed. He hung the 35 ft (11 m) of muslin from a steel gantry and connected the bottom to a rod. By moving the gantry and rod, he was able to create the illusion of a tornado moving across the stage. Fuller's earth was sprayed from both the top and bottom using compressed air hoses to complete the effect. Dorothy's house was recreated using a model. Stock footage of this tornado was later recycled for a climactic scene in the 1943 musical film Cabin in the Sky, directed by Judy Garland's eventual second husband Vincente Minnelli.The Cowardly Lion and Scarecrow masks were made of foam latex makeup created by makeup artist Jack Dawn. Dawn was one of the first to use this technique. It took an hour each day to slowly peel Bolger's glued-on mask from his face, a process that eventually left permanent lines around his mouth and chin.The Tin Man's costume was made of leather-covered buckram, and the oil used to grease his joints was made from chocolate syrup. The Cowardly Lion's costume was made from real lion skin and fur. Due to the heavy makeup, Bert Lahr could only consume soup and milkshakes on break, which eventually made him sick. After a few months, Lahr put his foot down and requested normal meals along with makeup redos after lunch. For the \"horse of a different color\" scene, Jell-O powder was used to color the white horses. Asbestos was used to achieve some of the special effects, such as the witch's burning broomstick and the fake snow that covers Dorothy as she sleeps in the field of poppies."

They won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Over the Rainbow\". The song ranks first in the AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs and the Recording Industry Association of America's \"365 Songs of the Century\".\nMGM composer Herbert Stothart, a well-known Hollywood composer and songwriter, won the Academy Award for Best Original Score.\nGeorgie Stoll was associate conductor, and screen credit was given to George Bassman, Murray Cutter, Ken Darby and Paul Marquardt for orchestral and vocal arrangements. (As usual, Roger Edens was also heavily involved as an unbilled musical associate to Freed.)The songs were recorded in the studio's scoring stage before filming. Several of the recordings were completed while Ebsen was still with the cast. Although he had to be dropped from the cast because of a dangerous reaction to his aluminum powder makeup, his singing voice remained on the soundtrack (as mentioned in the notes for the CD Deluxe Edition). He can be heard in the group vocals of \"We're Off to See the Wizard\".\nBolger's original recording of \"If I Only Had a Brain\" was far more sedate than the version in the film.

        "content": "Principal photography concluded with the Kansas sequences on March 16, 1939. Reshoots and pickup shots were done through April and May and into June, under the direction of producer LeRoy. When the \"Over the Rainbow\" reprise was removed after subsequent test screenings in early June, Garland had to be brought back to reshoot the \"Auntie Em, I'm frightened!\" scene without the song. The footage of Blandick's Aunt Em, as shot by Vidor, had already been set aside for rear-projection work, and was reused.\nAfter Hamilton's torturous experience with the Munchkinland elevator, she refused to do the pickups for the scene where she flies on a broomstick that billows smoke, so LeRoy had stunt double Betty Danko perform instead. Danko was severely injured when the smoke mechanism malfunctioned.At this point, the film began a long, arduous post-production. Herbert Stothart composed the film's background score, while A. Arnold Gillespie perfected the special effects, including many of the rear-projection shots. The MGM art department created matte paintings for many scene backgrounds.\nA significant innovation planned for the film was the use of stencil printing for the transition to Technicolor. Each frame was to be hand-tinted to maintain the sepia tone. However, it was abandoned because it was too expensive and labor-intensive, and MGM used a simpler, less expensive technique: During the May reshoots, the inside of the farmhouse was painted sepia, and when Dorothy opens the door, it is not Garland, but her stand-in, Bobbie Koshay, wearing a sepia gingham dress, who then backs out of frame. Once the camera moves through the door, Garland steps back into frame in her bright blue gingham dress (as noted in DVD extras), and the sepia-painted door briefly tints her with the same color before she emerges from the house's shadow, into the bright glare of the Technicolor lighting. This also meant that the reshoots provided the first proper shot of Munchkinland. If one looks carefully, the brief cut to Dorothy looking around outside the house bisects a single long shot, from the inside of the doorway to the pan-around that finally ends in a reverse-angle as the ruins of the house are seen behind Dorothy and she comes to a stop at the foot of the small bridge.\nTest screenings of the film began on June 5, 1939. Oz initially ran nearly two hours long. In 1939, the average film ran for about 90 minutes. LeRoy and Fleming knew they needed to cut at least 15 minutes to get the film down to a manageable running time. Three sneak previews in San Bernardino, Pomona and San Luis Obispo, California, guided LeRoy and Fleming in the cutting. Among the many cuts were \"The Jitterbug\" number, the Scarecrow's elaborate dance sequence following \"If I Only Had a Brain\", reprises of \"Over the Rainbow\" and \"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\", and a number of smaller dialogue sequences. This left the final, mostly serious portion of the film with no songs, only the dramatic underscoring.\n\"Over the Rainbow\" was almost deleted. MGM felt that it made the Kansas sequence too long, as well as being far over the heads of the target audience of children. The studio also thought that it was degrading for Garland to sing in a barnyard. LeRoy, uncredited associate producer Arthur Freed and director Fleming fought to keep it in, and they eventually won. The song went on to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song, and came to be identified so strongly with Garland herself that she made it her signature song.\nAfter the preview in San Luis Obispo in early July, the film was officially released in August 1939 at its current 101-minute running time."

It went on to win seven Tony Awards, including Best Musical.\nIn 1975, a comic book adaptation of the film titled MGM's Marvelous Wizard of Oz was released. It was the first co-production between DC Comics and Marvel Comics. Marvel planned a series of sequels based on the subsequent novels. The first, The Marvelous Land of Oz, was published later that year. The next, The Marvelous Ozma of Oz was expected to be released the following year but never came to be.In 1985, Walt Disney Productions released the live-action fantasy film Return to Oz, starring Fairuza Balk in her film debut as a young Dorothy Gale and based on The Marvelous Land of Oz (1904) and Ozma of Oz (1907). With a darker story, it fared poorly with critics unfamiliar with the Oz books and was not successful at the box office, although it has since become a popular cult film, with many considering it a more loyal and faithful adaptation of what L. Frank Baum envisioned.The Broadway musical Wicked premiered in 2003, and is based on the film and original novel. It has since gone on to become the second-highest grossing Broadway musical of all time, and won three Tony Awards, seven Drama Desk Awards, and a Grammy Award. A two-part film adaptation of the musical, directed by Jon M. Chu, has been in development at Universal Pictures since 2004, with Part One and Part Two scheduled to be released in 2024 and 2025 respectively.\nAndrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice produced a stage musical of the same name, which opened in 2011 at the West End's London Palladium.\nAn animated film called Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz was released in 2011 by Warner Home Video, incorporating Tom and Jerry into the story as Dorothy's \"protectors\". A sequel titled Tom and Jerry: Back to Oz was released on DVD on June 21, 2016.In 2013, Walt Disney Pictures released a \"spiritual prequel\" titled Oz the Great and Powerful. It was directed by Sam Raimi and starred James Franco, Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams. It was the second film based on Baum's Oz series to be produced by Disney, after Return to Oz. It was a commercial success but received a mixed reception from critics.In 2014, independent film company Clarius Entertainment released a big-budget animated musical film, Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return, which follows Dorothy's second trip to Oz. The film fared poorly at the box office and was received negatively by critics, largely for its plot and unmemorable musical numbers.\nIn February 2021, New Line Cinema, Temple Hill Entertainment and Wicked producer Marc Platt announced that a new film version of the original book is in the works with Watchmen's Nicole Kassell slated to direct the reimagining, which will have the option to include elements from the 1939 film.In August 2022 it was announced that Kenya Barris would write and direct a modern remake. In January 2024, Barris confirmed that he finished penning the script and remarked \"The original Wizard of Oz took place during the Great Depression and it was about self-reliance and what people were going through, I think this is the perfect time to switch the characters and talk about what someone imagines their life could be. It's ultimately a hero's journey, someone thinks something\u2019s better than where they're at, and they go and realize that where they're at is where they should be. I want people to be proud and happy about where they're from. But I want the world to take a look at it and I hope that will come through.\" This involved changing the time period to the present day and changing Dorothy's home from Kansas to the Bottoms of Inglewood, California.The 2024 marketing campaign for season 22 of American Idol is directly themed after this film, complete with a commercial featuring Ryan Seacrest and the judges Katy Perry, Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan dressed as Tin Man, Dorothy, Cowardly Lion and Scarecrow following the \"Golden Ticket Road\" to Hollywood. This was to reflect the show's plans to visit the judges' hometowns throughout the season."

        "content": "The Empire Strikes Back (also known as Star Wars: Episode V \u2013 The Empire Strikes Back) is a 1980 American epic space opera film directed by Irvin Kershner from a screenplay by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan, based on a story by George Lucas. The sequel to Star Wars (1977), it is the second film in the Star Wars film series and the fifth chronological chapter of the \"Skywalker Saga\". Set three years after the events of Star Wars, the film recounts the battle between the malevolent Galactic Empire, led by the Emperor, and the Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia. Rebel ally Luke Skywalker trains to master the Force so he can confront the Emperor's powerful disciple, Darth Vader. The ensemble cast includes Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, David Prowse, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, and Frank Oz.\nFollowing the success of Star Wars, Lucas hired Brackett to write the sequel. After she died in 1978, he outlined the whole Star Wars saga and wrote the next draft himself, before hiring Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) writer Kasdan to enhance his work. To avoid the stress he faced directing Star Wars, Lucas handed the responsibility to Kershner and focused on expanding his special effects company Industrial Light & Magic instead. Filmed from March to September 1979 in Finse, Norway, and at Elstree Studios in England, The Empire Strikes Back faced production difficulties, including actor injuries, illnesses, fires, and problems securing additional financing as costs rose. Initially budgeted at $8 million, costs had risen to $30.5 million by the project's conclusion.\nReleased on May 21, 1980, the highly anticipated sequel became the highest-grossing film that year, earning approximately $401.5 million worldwide. Unlike its lighthearted predecessor, Empire met with mixed reviews from critics, and fans were conflicted about its darker and more mature themes. Critics praised the expressive features and characterization of the puppeteered character Yoda, a diminutive creature who serves as Luke's teacher. The film was nominated for various awards and won two Academy Awards, two Grammy Awards, and a BAFTA, among others. Subsequent releases have raised the film's worldwide gross to $538\u2013549 million and, adjusted for inflation, it is the 13th-highest-grossing film in the United States and Canada.\nSince its release, The Empire Strikes Back has been critically reassessed and is now often regarded as the best film in the Star Wars series and among the greatest films ever made. It has had a significant impact on filmmaking and popular culture and is often considered an example of a sequel superior to its predecessor. The climax, in which Vader reveals he is Luke's father, is often ranked as one of the greatest plot twists in cinema. The film spawned a variety of merchandise and adaptations, including video games and a radio play. The United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2010. Return of the Jedi (1983) followed Empire, concluding the original Star Wars trilogy. Prequel and sequel trilogies have since been released."

        "content": "Three years after the destruction of the Death Star, the Imperial fleet, led by Darth Vader, dispatches probe droids across the galaxy in search for the Rebel Alliance. One probe locates the rebels base on the ice planet Hoth. A wampa captures Luke Skywalker before he can investigate the probe, but he escapes by using the Force to retrieve his lightsaber and wound the beast. Before Luke succumbs to hypothermia, the Force spirit of his deceased mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi, instructs him to go to the swamp planet Dagobah to train as a Jedi Knight under the Jedi Master Yoda. Han Solo discovers Luke and insulates him against the weather inside his deceased tauntaun mount until they are rescued the next morning.\nAlerted to the Rebels' location, the Empire launches a large-scale attack using AT-AT walkers, forcing the Rebels to evacuate the base. Han, Princess Leia, C-3PO and Chewbacca escape aboard the Millennium Falcon, but the ship's hyperdrive malfunctions. They hide in an asteroid field, where Han and Leia grow closer amid the tension. Vader summons several bounty hunters, including Boba Fett, to find the Falcon. Evading the Imperial fleet, Han's group travels to the floating Cloud City on the gas planet Bespin, which is governed by his old friend Lando Calrissian. Fett tracks them there and Vader forces Lando to surrender the group to the Empire, knowing Luke will come to their aid.\nMeanwhile, Luke travels with R2-D2 in his X-wing fighter to Dagobah, where he crash-lands. He meets Yoda, a diminutive creature who reluctantly accepts him as his Jedi apprentice after conferring with Obi-Wan's spirit. Yoda trains Luke to master the light side of the Force and resist negative emotions that will seduce him to the dark side, as they did Vader. Luke struggles to control his anger and impulsiveness and fails to comprehend the nature and power of the Force until he witnesses Yoda use it to levitate the X-wing from the swamp. Luke has a premonition of Han and Leia in pain and, despite Obi-Wan's and Yoda's protestations, abandons his training to rescue them. Although Obi-Wan believes Luke is their only hope, Yoda asserts that \"there is another.\"\nLeia confesses her love for Han before Vader freezes him in carbonite to test whether the process will safely imprison Luke. Han survives and is given to Fett, who intends to collect his bounty from Jabba the Hutt. Lando frees Leia and Chewbacca, but they are too late to stop Fett's escape. The group fights its way back to the Falcon and flees the city. Luke arrives and engages Vader in a lightsaber duel over the city's central air shaft. Vader overwhelms Luke, severing his right hand and separating him from his lightsaber. He urges Luke to embrace the dark side and help him destroy his master, the Emperor, so they may rule the galaxy together. Luke refuses, citing Obi-Wan's claim that Vader killed his father, prompting Vader to reveal that he is Luke's father. Desperate, Luke plunges down the air shaft and is ejected beneath the floating city, latching onto an antenna. He reaches out through the Force to Leia, and the Falcon returns to rescue him. They are attacked by TIE fighters but narrowly evade capture by Vader's Star Destroyer when R2-D2 repairs the Falcon's hyperdrive and the vessel escapes.\nAfter the group joins the rebel fleet, Luke's missing hand is replaced by a robotic prosthesis. He, Leia, C-3PO, and R2-D2 observe as Lando and Chewbacca depart on the Falcon to find Han."

He eventually finds a good suitor for her and then he has to shell out dowry for the groom's family -whereby the marriage is arranged and preparations made. Therefore, Ramji plans to go to London and work as a cook  for a multi-millionaire dollar London-based Indian businessman-family. The arrangement is that Ramji  will have to send  part of his salary as a compensation for the dowry he owes. Unfortunately on the day Ramji arrives at the employer's door-step, the millionaire who hired him is very sick, and eventually passes away before signing Ramji's paperwork- leaving him jobless. Desperate to stay and earn (as he had promised his sister's dowry), he starts working illegally  (without work-permit) as an expert Indian chef in an Indian restaurant owned by an NRI, Guru, who has a wife and a handicapped son. Eventually, due to his good manners, friendliness and expert skills he wins the family's heart. As the restaurant becomes lucrative due to Ramji's excellent culinary skills, the police are on his heels.\nJai Kapoor, Guru's cunning lawyer friend, explains that the only way out is marriage with a British citizen, and suggests Ramji to marry his own girlfriend Samira. Guru also convinces Ramji to do 'marriage of convenience' so that he can win this case against the police who have filed a case against his restaurant business (hiring illegal immigrants). Ramji reluctantly agrees for a \"fake\" marriage with Jai's girlfriend Samira, and they get married over the weekend inside a church (so that paperwork comes faster). For all these gimmicks, the lawyer charges heavy fees from Mr. Guru and deposits them in the joint account of his with Samira.\nThe police become more and more suspicious that this is a fake marriage and refer the matter to the consulate. The embassy invites both Ramji and Samira for interview for which they start preparing by getting to know each other better. By this time, Ramji finds out more about the cunning shrewd character of Jai (the lawyer) in a chance meeting at the bus stop with Jai's ex -wife. The lady explains how Jai had promised her so many things and then suddenly deserted her and her son- for which she will seek revenge on him for abandoning his family. Ramji explains this all to Samira and Samira also meets with Jai's ex-wife. In the meantime, constant stalking by the police forces Samira and Ramji to stay/live  together to avoid detection by authority. Samira is deeply troubled with rural mannerisms of Ramji. To break the ice, Ramji cooks delicacies for Samira and wins her heart. Gradually, Samira also  realises that Jai is merely fooling around with her life and doesn't really love her.\nMeanwhile, Ramji is not able to send the dowry installments as promised and his sister's in-laws throw her out of the house. Ramji's sister desperately calls Ramji and Samira answers the call and handles the situation by sending all the money received for the fake marriage in her and Jai's\njoint account to her and makes sure her long-time friend is taken care of. Unfortunately, in their final interview with the consulate, Ramji answers more than he is asked at the immigration office then is forced to return to India ( due to being illegal worker). However, as  Ramji is preparing to be deported a good news comes; Ramji wins a cooking competition (which Samira had enlisted him for) and thus, wins more money and employment opportunities at Ritz Hotel.\nRamji replies to Samira that he will use his \u00a350,000 competition money to build an English school in his village so no one will be illiterate. Samiras granny gives her passport and a ticket so she can join ramji. After 10 months his restaurant is ready in India and his sister has had a baby. In the meantime, they are all waiting for a mystery guest to inaugurate the restaurant. This turns out to be Amitabh Bacchan and the movie ends with him cutting the ribbon."

Upon release, the film garnered positive reviews from critics, but the small nature of the film meant that it only became an average grosser at the box office. Critic Baradwaj Rangan wrote, \"This may be the story of a cook, but there\u2019s also food for thought!\" Taran Adarsh wrote, \"On the whole, Ramji Londonwaley is a feel-good entertainer that gives you a positive feeling at the conclusion of the show\". The BBC's Dharmesh Rajput gave the film a predominantly positive review, stating \"it's overlong and unnecessarily complicated but R Madhavan's central performance still manages to charm your socks off\". The critic added the film is \"gracelessly edited and over-stuffed with sub-plots \u2013 but the film's saving grace is its cast\", and praises that \"Madhavan's charismatic and expressive performance provides most of the film's nicely understated humour\" and British actress Shalu Verma and Bangargi also impress\". A critic from Rediff.com wrote \"it's irritating because this could have been polished into a good film, maybe even a memorable film\" and that \"Madhavan makes a valiant attempt, and renders the film almost entirely watchable, but that happens to be a big almost, sadly\"."

        "content": "The film begins on an empty comedy stage with a large microphone. Steve Mazan enters and speaks directly into camera. This narrative device is used throughout the film. Mazan explains that since he was a young boy, he dreamed of performing on David Letterman's show. He became a professional stand-up comedian, and performed shows around the country in hopes of one day making it to the Ed Sullivan Theater where the Late Show with David Letterman was taped before a live studio audience. He then learns he has cancer, and may only have five years to live. His girlfriend at the time, Denise, is shocked by the news, but the couple makes the decision to get married. Together, they also decide that Steve should spend the time he has left pursuing his dream of performing on Letterman's show.\nMazan launches his Dying to Do Letterman campaign, asking people to email the Late Show with David Letterman staff with the subject line \"Book Mazan.\" Hundreds of emails are sent on Mazan's behalf. He receives a letter from an executive producer of The Late Show. The letter states that many sick people with emotional stories write to the show and ask to appear in an episode, but as a policy they cannot honor such requests. Undeterred, Steve decides to perform more comedy shows, write new material, and seek advice from professional comedians who have appeared on Letterman.\nAs the film progresses, Steve sits down with numerous comedians who are veterans of David Letterman's show. These include Ray Romano, Kevin Nealon, Jim Gaffigan, Brian Regan, Arj Barker, and Will Durst. The conversations cover why Letterman was so important to them, and explore how the comedians achieved their first appearance on Letterman's stage. The comics also offer advice to Mazan on his quest. Interspersed with the comedian interviews and Mazan's writing process are scenes tracking Mazan's health. His cancer is growing slowly, but Mazan is informed that the tumors on his liver could quickly accelerate their growth at any time, which would likely lead to his death. During this process, Mazan manages to send a DVD of his act to Letterman's booker, Eddie Brill. Brill likes Steve but thinks his material is wrong. He offers Mazan advice on how to tweak his act for the show, but makes no promises about booking him.\nMazan continues to write and test new material. The process includes a trip to Iraq where Mazan performs for American troops. During the performance, the base is bombed. Cameras catch Mazan and the comedy show audience running through the night as an ammunition dump explodes behind them, but Mazan escapes unharmed. He jokes that \"it's not just cancer that can kill you.\" He continues to send off new material to Letterman's booker, Brill. Despite many submissions, several years pass and Mazan receives no communication from the show. He begins to believe that he won't be booked, and decides it may be time to give up on his Letterman dream. At that time Mazan sits down with another comedian diagnosed with cancer, Robert Schimmel. Schimmel encourages Steve to continue his journey and keep chasing his dream. A title card then informs viewers that Schimmel died shortly thereafter.\nMazan makes a final audition DVD for Letterman's show and sends it off. Letterman's booker Eddie Brill likes the DVD and wants to book Mazan. However, comedians are often cancelled at the last minute, and Mazan won't know if he will perform until right before showtime. The film ends as Mazan takes the Letterman stage. Title cards inform viewers that on September 4, 2009, Mazan performed on the Letterman show. He received five applause breaks, and his sickness was never mentioned. A quick shot of Mazan then reveals that he is still alive and healthy.\nOver the final credits the film shows a montage of Mazan practicing his final routine at comedy clubs intercut with the actual Letterman performance. The routine centers on key cards that become demagnetized, and the frustrations of being locked out of one's hotel room."

As she steadily takes the place of his dead wife, Lowry attempts to murder her as well. While attempting to murder Lily, by following someone who looked like her through the fog, he mistakenly kills Constable Burke's wife and gets chased by an angry mob, which he evades. Lily returns home and Stephen learns of his mistake. Some local bar-goers saw him murder Mrs Burke and Stephen is put on trial, but their claims are dismissed after  they are revealed to drink a lot and Lily lies to provide an alibi. The main testimony however is Lily's - who swears he never left the house - she does this as she wants to marry him.\nAlthough Lowry owes Lily his life, his eyes are on another woman - Elizabeth Travers - the daughter of a wealthy man - and object of affection of his lawyer. He tells Lily it is part of a plot to gain money and he will use the money to take Lily and himself to America. He suggests he will marry her but demands she retrieves a letter she sent to her sister telling of Lowry's actions. But Herbert, her sister's husband rescues the letter from the fire. He goes to Lowry's lawyer and tries to extort \u00a3500 for the incriminating letter.\nLowry feigns illness and sends Lily to fetch the doctor. She says she will return urgently with the doctor within five minutes. He calculates this will be enough time for him to frame her by drinking the poison that he used to kill his own wife and planting it and his wife's jewelry in Lily's room.\nLily is, however, detained by the police as the \"tell-all\" letter she has written to her sister, to safeguard herself after the master's failed plot to kill her, surfaces.\nLowry's plan backfires - he is dying. He gets Burke the local policeman to run for the doctor. Meanwhile Lily's handwriting is compared to the letter. Lily is told it doesn't match - but it does. A warrant is sworn for the arrest of Lowry. Lily returns to the house and pieces together the situation, realising that Stephen never loved her as he accuses her of poisoning both him and his wife. After the doctor declares it's too late to save him, Lowry admits \u201cI timed it, you said you\u2019d be only five minutes!\u201d. Stephen dies and Lily is asked to go to the police station for questioning."

They studied medicine in the same college and wanted to marry, but her father arranged an alliance with an entrepreneur named Karthik. In the present, Rishi, who still loves Sweta, leaves for India on the pretense of attending a relative's marriage. He hires a car from Babu Khan, a travel agent, takes a SIM card on his sister's address and stays at Hotel Marriott. Rishi meets Sweta at a restaurant and learns her five-year-old daughter Riya is missing. She laments that no one else, including Karthik, believes that Riya actually exists. Rishi also learns about Karthik's brother Bobby, a drug addict who regularly visits her home.\nRishi begins an informal investigation which fails many times, also inviting the ire of two African-American gangsters in the city. Babu, who helps them in transporting drugs, saves Rishi on humanitarian grounds. Posing as Vasanth Khanna, a police officer, Rishi meets Karthik and learns that the couple was childless. Karthik recalls Sweta being attacked by two masked men before a school to steal her car. He added that Sweta went into a coma and post-recovery started claiming that she had a five-year-old daughter named Riya. Perplexed, Rishi later watches a closed-circuit television video footage of the masked men attacking Sweta on the day when Riya went missing. Unfortunately, Riya is seen nowhere in the footage, which makes Rishi doubt Sweta's mental condition.\nRishi confronts Sweta, who refuses to acknowledge that Riya is imaginary. Rishi sees height markings of a child on a wall, and before he could react, Sweta commits suicide in his presence. ACP Jaya and Inspector Ravi Chowdary investigate the suicide case. Khanna is killed in Marriott, and Babu confesses to Rishi that he saw Bobby kidnapping Riya. They meet Jaya and Chowdary and get Bobby arrested. In custody, Bobby is killed by Jaya in an act of self-defense. The same night, Khanna's murderers attack Babu and Rishi, and Babu is killed in the process of shooting the murderers to death. Rishi watches a MMS in the murderers' phone sent by Jaya instructing to kill him. Rishi meets Jaya at her farmhouse, where Riya is hidden.\nJaya reveals that Karthik wanted to kill Riya and arranged the attack on Sweta, after which Jaya found Riya in Bobby's custody. After meeting Riya, Jaya conspires to raise the girl as her daughter because she had lost her own husband and unborn daughter in a car accident. Jaya wanted to name her daughter Riya, so when she saw Sweta's daughter, she convinced herself that her daughter has come back. Thus, Jaya made a deal with Karthik; Karthik wanted Sweta to suffer so according to Jaya's plan, he convinced his friends and family to pretend that Riya never existed, saying Sweta cannot bear the shock of her daughter's death. Before Jaya can kill Rishi, Chowdary shoots her after listening to the conversation on his way to the farmhouse with his subordinates. Karthik is arrested and reveals that Riya is not his daughter, as a medical report confirmed him sterile in the past. Rishi remembers his last meeting with Sweta; she visited him to invite him to her wedding, and they made love. Rishi now realises Riya is his biological child.

Promoted by Poole with an advertising campaign unprecedented for a pornographic feature, it premiered in 1971 at the 253-seat 55th Street Playhouse in Manhattan, where it was an immediate critical and commercial success. The film brought Donovan international recognition.

He strips and sits on blanket, watching the sea intently. Suddenly, out in the water, blond naked Donovan appears and runs up onto the beach to Fisk. Fisk performs oral sex on Donovan, who then leads Fisk into the woods. Fisk grabs the blanket and follows, catching up to Donovan in a clearing. They kiss and touch each other, then Donovan takes a studded leather strap from Fisk's wrist and attaches it around Fisk's genitalia. They continue the scene, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Fisk. Following Donovan's climax he returns to servicing Fisk orally and, as Fisk is climaxing, momentary flashes of previous scenes are intercut. The scene ends with Fisk taking the strap from his genitals and attaching it around Donovan's wrist. Fisk runs into the ocean and vanishes, mirroring Donovan's entrance. Donovan dons Fisk's abandoned clothes and heads off down the beach.\nPoolside: The segment opens with Donovan on a pier, holding a newspaper. He returns to his house, strips by the pool and begins reading. Intrigued by an ad in the back of the paper, Donovan writes a letter in response. After a number of days pass (marked by fluttering calendar pages), he receives a reply in the form of a package. Inside is a tablet, which he throws into the pool. The water starts to churn and dark-haired Danny Di Cioccio emerges to Donovan's delight. The two couple by the pool, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Di Cioccio in a variety of positions. Di Cioccio turns the tables and tops Donovan until Donovan's climax. The scene closes with the two engaged in horseplay in the pool and then walking off together down a boardwalk.\nInside: This final segment opens with shots of Donovan showering, toweling off and wandering idly around his room, intercut with shots of African-American telephone repairman Tommy Moore checking various poles and lines outside. Donovan spots Moore from his balcony, and Moore sees Donovan as well. The remainder of the segment consists of Donovan's fantasized sexual encounters with Moore throughout the house intercut with shots of Donovan sniffing poppers and penetrating himself with a large black dildo. The segment ends following Donovan's climax with the dildo, with the real Moore coming inside the house and closing the door behind them."

Somebody oughta be able to do something better than this.\" Poole was convinced that he was that somebody; \"I wanted [to make] a film that gay people could look at and say, 'I don't mind being gay - it's beautiful to see those people do what they're doing.'\" Having enlisted the help of his lover Peter Fisk and another man, Poole first shot a 10-minute segment titled Bayside.The success of that initial shoot convinced Poole to plan two more segments and seek theatrical distribution for the completed work. He hired Tommy Moore and Casey Donovan for the third segment, Inside. When Fisk's scene partner from Bayside heard about the potential distribution deal, he refused to sign release forms until he was guaranteed 20% of the profits. Instead, Poole decided to scrap the segment and re-shoot with Fisk and Donovan. The resulting footage was so good that Poole decided to use Donovan for the second segment as well, titled Poolside, and he constructed the loose storyline around him. The three segments were filmed on a budget of $8,000 over three successive weekends in August 1971 in the gay resort area of Cherry Grove, New York."

        "content": "Boys in the Sand had its theatrical debut on December 29, 1971, at the 55th Street Playhouse in New York City. Poole engaged in an unprecedented pre-release publicity campaign, including screening parties and full-page ads in The New York Times and Variety.\nThe line, for the first showing, reached 7th Avenue. The film made back most of its production and promotions budget the day it opened, grossing close to $6,000 in the first hour, and nearly $25,000 during its first week, landing it on Variety's list of the week's 50 top-grossing films. Positive word of mouth spread and the film was favorably reviewed in Variety (\"There are no more closets!\"), The Advocate (\"Everyone will fall in love with this philandering fellator\"), and other outlets, which previously had completely ignored the genre. While some critics were less impressed, others saw the film as akin to the avant-garde work of directors like Kenneth Anger and Andy Warhol. Within six months the film had grossed $140,000 and was continuing to open in theatres across the United States and around the world.The film's mainstream popularity helped usher in the era of \"porno chic,\" a brief period of mainstream cultural acceptability afforded hardcore pornographic film, having been cited as \"very much a precursor\" to the following year's crossover success of Deep Throat. The film attracted critical and scholarly attention from pornography historians and researchers for years after its release. The film is credited with beginning the trend of giving pornographic films titles that spoof the names of non-porn films.With the success of Boys in the Sand, Casey Donovan became an underground celebrity. While he never achieved the mainstream film career for which he had hoped, he continued his career in pornography and translated his fame into some appearances on the legitimate stage, including a successful national tour in the gay-themed play Tubstrip and an unsuccessful attempt to produce a revival of The Ritz. His fame also allowed him success as a high-priced prostitute. He remained a bankable commodity in the adult industry, making films for the next 15 years until his death from AIDS-related illness in 1987."

The original opening sequence, Bayside, was recreated for the sequel, with Pat Allen performing the run from the water. Litigation tied up the release of Boys in the Sand II until 1986 and with the advent of the home video market, there was a glut of gay porn titles available. Boys in the Sand II did not distinguish itself from the competition and was not particularly successful.In 2002, TLA Releasing released The Wakefield Poole Collection. The two-DVD set includes Boys in the Sand and Boys in the Sand II along with Bijou (1972), a third Poole/Donovan collaboration, and other shorts and material shot by Poole. The collection won a 2003 GayVN Award for Best Classic Gay DVD.In May 2014, filmmaker and writer Jim Tushinski's full-length documentary I Always Said Yes: The Many Lives of Wakefield Poole, which features extensive interviews with Poole, producer Marvin Schulman, and many contemporaries, began playing at film festivals.

The partnership endured through 33 novels and 39 short stories written by Stout, but continued in only one more film for Columbia Pictures.

Kimball (Walter Kingsford) and his son Manuel (Russell Hardie) are welcomed into the party of elderly Professor Barstow (Boyd Irwin Sr.) and his prospective son-in-law Claude Roberts (Victor Jory). Barstow sends his caddy back to the clubhouse to fetch his visor, and finds himself without his clubs when it is his turn to tee off. The elder Kimball loans his driver to Barstow. Immediately after hitting his drive, Barstow flinches. \"A mosquito bit me just as I hit the ball,\" he complains with good humor. \"Too bad,\" Kimball replies sympathetically, taking the club from Barstow and making his own drive. As the foursome sets out on the course, Barstow is stricken and succumbs quickly to an apparent heart attack.\nAt the New York brownstone of Nero Wolfe (Edward Arnold), Marie Maringola (Rita Hayworth) offers the sedentary detective genius $50 to find her brother. Although he is an expert metal worker, Carlo Maringola had such trouble finding work in America that he planned to return to the old country. On the eve of his departure Carlo told his sister that he could stay in America after all \u2014 he got a job. They had arranged a celebration but Carlo never came. He disappeared.\nWolfe takes Maria's case and sends his confidential assistant Archie Goodwin (Lionel Stander) to investigate at Carlo's apartment house. Archie returns to the brownstone with evidence that suggests that Carlo will never be found alive \u2014 and that his death is linked to the death of Professor Barstow. Wolfe theorizes that Barstow was killed by a specially constructed golf club, one that was converted by Carlo into an air rifle that propelled a poisoned needle into his midsection when he struck the ball. His theory is borne out by an autopsy of Barstow, and the discovery of Carlo's body.\nSolving the murder of Professor Barstow will be a far more lucrative endeavor, Wolfe is pleased to learn: a $50,000 reward has been offered. But interviews with Barstow's daughter (Joan Perry), his widow (Nana Bryant) and his doctor (Frank Conroy), do little to advance the investigation.\nFar more helpful is a luncheon for the four boys who caddied for Professor Barstow's foursome. Hearing their accounts, Wolfe concludes that the intended murder victim had been E.J. Kimball, not Barstow.\nKimball dismisses the notion that his life is in danger until he is informed that his car has been wrecked and his chauffeur is dead \u2014 killed by a fer-de-lance, a South American snake that is probably the most poisonous in the world. The autopsies of Professor Barstow and Carlo Maringola reveal that they too were poisoned, by the venom of the fer-de-lance. Convinced that his life is in deadly peril, Kimball pleads for Wolfe's help.\nAfter E.J. Kimball tells him about his sensational past in South America, Wolfe concludes that at least six people had reason to wish him dead \u2014 and that the Barstow family is not above suspicion. Wolfe assigns Archie to move in with Kimball and his son, to watch over the old man. After a long game of Monopoly on the Kimballs' terrace that evening, the three men rise to go in to dinner \u2014 and shots are fired.\nThe attack causes Wolfe to summon all of the principals to the brownstone. They are to spend the night, and they will stay as long as necessary.  The next evening a deadly parcel arrives, addressed to Wolfe. The killer has Wolfe in his sights \u2014 and Wolfe knows he has the killer under his roof."

Instead Edward Arnold got it,\" reported John McAleer in Rex Stout: A Biography (1977). \"Columbia's idea was to keep Arnold busy with low-cost Wolfe films between features. Two films presently were made by Columbia, Meet Nero Wolfe (Fer-de-Lance) and The League of Frightened Men. Connolly did portray Wolfe in the latter film, after Arnold decided he did not want to become identified in the public mind with one part. Lionel Stander portrayed Archie Goodwin. Stander was a capable actor but, as Archie, Rex thought he had been miscast.\"Meet Nero Wolfe was the second film directed by Herbert Biberman (1900\u20131971), a director rooted in the theater who became best known as one of the Hollywood Ten.\n\"Fresh from the theater, Biberman blocked shots instead of composing them,\" wrote Bernard F. Dick in Radical Innocence: A Critical Study of the Hollywood Ten (1989):\n\nBiberman opened up the action a bit, but the plot, based on Stout's Fer-de-Lance (1934), defeated him. He simply did not understand the medium; the cast reacts as it would on stage, but in film a stage reaction is overacting. Apart from some filmic touches \u2014 swish pans, dissolves, wipes, and an eerie shot of a dead man's hand clutching a newspaper clipping that another hand reaches down to retrieve \u2014 Meet Nero Wolfe is like a West End melodrama aimed at the tourist trade \u2014 slick, but so ephemeral that two days later the plot has vanished from the memory.The film's greatest departure from the original story is the creation of Mazie Gray, who can indeed call herself Mrs. Archie Goodwin at the end of Meet Nero Wolfe. The decidedly un-Wolfean character is played by Dennie Moore,  memorable for her performance as Olga the gossipy manicurist in the 1939 film, The Women."

        "content": "\"A most comforting sort of detective for these humid days is Nero Wolfe, a sedentary sleuth given to drinking great quantities of homemade beer in his cool, shade-drawn brownstone and solving murder mysteries therefrom by means of remote control,\" wrote The New York Times (July 16, 1936):\n\nMr. Wolfe is, of course, the rotund Edward Arnold, whose characterization of Rex Stout's fairly recent fictional figure presages brisk competition for such current screen master minds as Philo Vance and Perry Mason, both in matters of deduction as well as esthetically. Where Mr. Vance, for example, collects old chrysoprase and what not, Nero Wolfe grows orchids. Mr. Wolfe sets a precedent, too, in achieving something that seems not to have occurred to the other ratiocinators of the cinema. He collects huge fees.\"Its hero, less dashing than Philo Vance and less whimsical than Charlie Chan, but more mercenary than either, will be a highly acceptable addition to the screen's growing corps of private operatives,\" wrote Time (July 27, 1936).\n\"The comedy and the guessing elements have been deftly mixed, the well-knit narrative precludes any drooping in interest and the cast disports itself in crack whodunit fashion,\" wrote Variety (July 22, 1936):\n\nIn bringing the Rex Stout figment to life Arnold has contributed lots more than girth and a capacity for beer guzzling. His Nero Wolfe jells suavely with the imagination and makes a piquant example of personality conception. For seven years this corpulent sleuth, with a craving for nothing but good food and ease, has not ventured from his home. When he isn't unraveling a crime for the cash it will bring him, he gravitates between two hobbies, bottle tilting and orchid growing.Task of digging up evidence and following out leads for Wolfe on the outside falls to Lionel Stander. It's a typical mugg role for Stander but the performance he turns in pegs him as an important entertainment factor in the film.In 2002 Scarlet Street magazine revisited Meet Nero Wolfe \u2014 little seen in the years after its release \u2014 and found it neither the travesty it is sometimes thought to be, nor a faithful recreation of the world of Nero Wolfe.\n\nIs it absurd and a \"betrayal\" of Stout to make Wolfe's orchid room a kind of greenhouse offshoot to his office? Of course, it is, but it's also a clever device that keeps the orchid-growing obsession in the action without breaking from the fairly complicated plot. Other departures \u2014 such as transforming chef Fritz Brenner into the Swedish Olaf ... are less explicable. ...What goes wrong \u2014 at least from a purist's standpoint \u2014 is the decision to portray Wolfe as a far too jolly character. This is odd in itself, since Arnold was rarely an actor who specialized in projecting good humor.Judging the film as a film and dismissing questions of fidelity to the source material, Meet Nero Wolfe is an above average minor A picture, a solid mystery, and unfailingly entertaining. Certain things \u2014 such as a sequence involving Archie playing the then new game of Monopoly \u2014 have a nice time capsule quality that has nothing to do with the Wolfe books, but have a value all their own. No, at bottom, it's not Rex Stout's Nero and Archie, but it's a well-developed mystery (thanks to Stout's plot) with compensations all its own \u2014 and an interesting piece of Wolfeana."

Players control Joel, a smuggler tasked with escorting a teenage girl, Ellie, across a post-apocalyptic United States. The Last of Us is played from a third-person perspective. Players use firearms and improvised weapons and can use stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated fungus. In the online multiplayer mode, up to eight players engage in cooperative and competitive gameplay.\nDevelopment of The Last of Us began in 2009, soon after the release of Naughty Dog's previous game, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. For the first time in the company's history, Naughty Dog split into two teams; while one team developed Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, the other half developed The Last of Us. The relationship between Joel and Ellie became the focus, with all other elements developed around it. Actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson portrayed Joel and Ellie, respectively, through voice and motion capture, and assisted creative director Neil Druckmann with the development of the characters and story. The original score was composed and performed by Gustavo Santaolalla.\nFollowing its announcement in December 2011, The Last of Us was widely anticipated. It was released for the PlayStation 3 in June 2013. It received critical acclaim, with praise for its narrative, gameplay, visuals, sound design, score, characterization, and depiction of female characters. The Last of Us became one of the best-selling video games, selling over 1.3 million units in its first week and 17 million by April 2018. The game won year-end accolades, including multiple Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications, critics, and game award ceremonies. It has been ranked as one of the greatest video games ever made.\nNaughty Dog released several downloadable content additions; The Last of Us: Left Behind adds a single-player campaign following Ellie and her best friend, Riley. A remastered version, The Last of Us Remastered, was released for the PlayStation 4 in July 2014. A remake, The Last of Us Part I, was released in September 2022 for PlayStation 5 and in March 2023 for Windows. A sequel, The Last of Us Part II, was released in 2020. Other The Last of Us media includes a comic book in 2013, a live show in 2014, a television adaptation by HBO in 2023, a tabletop game by Themeborne in 2024, and an upcoming tabletop game by CMON."

The player traverses post-apocalyptic environments such as towns, buildings, forests, and sewers to advance the story. The player can use firearms, improvised weapons, hand-to-hand combat, and stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. For most of the game, the player takes control of Joel, a man tasked with escorting a young girl, Ellie, across the United States. The player also controls Ellie throughout the game's winter segment and briefly controls Joel's daughter, Sarah, in the opening sequence.\nIn combat, the player can use long-range weapons, such as a rifle, a shotgun, and a bow, and short-range weapons such as a handgun and a short-barreled shotgun. The player is able to scavenge limited-use melee weapons, such as pipes and baseball bats, and throw bottles and bricks to distract, stun, or attack enemies. The player can upgrade weapons at workbenches using collected items. Equipment such as health kits, shivs, and Molotov cocktails can be found or crafted using collected items. Attributes such as the health meter and crafting speed can be upgraded by collecting pills and medicinal plants. Health can be recharged by finding edible items or through the use of health kits.Though the player can attack enemies directly, they can also use stealth to attack undetected or sneak by them. \"Listen Mode\" allows the player to locate enemies through a heightened sense of hearing and spatial awareness, indicated as outlines visible through walls and objects. In the dynamic cover system, the player can crouch behind obstacles to gain a tactical advantage during combat. The game features periods without combat, often involving conversation between the characters. The player can solve simple puzzles, such as using floating pallets to move Ellie, who is unable to swim, across bodies of water and using ladders or dumpsters to reach higher areas. Story collectibles, such as notes, maps and comics, can be scavenged and viewed in the backpack menu.The game features an artificial intelligence system by which hostile human enemies react to combat. If enemies discover the player, they may take cover or call for assistance, and can take advantage of the player when they are distracted, out of ammunition, or in a fight. Player companions, such as Ellie, can assist in combat by throwing objects at threats to stun them, announcing the location of unseen enemies, or using a knife and pistol to attack enemies."

        "content": "In 2013, an outbreak of a mutant Cordyceps fungus ravages the United States, transforming its human hosts into aggressive creatures. In the suburbs of Austin, Texas, Joel (Troy Baker) flees the chaos with his brother, Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce), and daughter, Sarah (Hana Hayes). As they flee, Sarah is shot by a soldier and dies in Joel's arms.\nTwenty years later, civilization has been decimated by the infection. Joel works as a smuggler with his partner, Tess (Annie Wersching), in a quarantine zone in Boston, Massachusetts. They hunt down Robert (Robin Atkin Downes), a black-market dealer, to recover a stolen weapons cache. Before Tess kills him, Robert reveals he traded the cache with the Fireflies, a rebel militia opposing the quarantine zone authorities. The Fireflies' leader, Marlene (Merle Dandridge), promises to double their cache in return for smuggling a teenage girl, Ellie (Ashley Johnson), to Fireflies hiding in the Massachusetts State House. While sneaking out at night, Joel and Tess discover Ellie is infected; she claims she is immune and may lead to a cure. At the State House, the trio discover the Fireflies have been killed and Tess reveals she has been infected. Believing in Ellie's importance, she sacrifices herself against pursuing soldiers so Joel and Ellie can escape. Joel decides to find Tommy, a former Firefly, in the hope that he can locate others.\nWith the help of Bill (W. Earl Brown), a smuggler and survivalist in Lincoln, Massachusetts, Joel and Ellie acquire a working vehicle. Driving into Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Joel and Ellie are ambushed by bandits and their car is wrecked. They ally with two brothers, Henry (Brandon Scott) and Sam (Nadji Jeter). After they escape the city, Sam is bitten but hides it from the group. As his infection takes hold, Sam attacks Ellie, but Henry shoots him dead before taking his own life.\nIn the fall, Joel and Ellie find Tommy in Jackson, Wyoming, where he has assembled a fortified settlement near a hydroelectric dam with his wife, Maria (Ashley Scott). Joel leaves Ellie with Tommy, but after she confronts him about Sarah, he lets her stay. Tommy directs them to a Firefly enclave at the University of Eastern Colorado. They find the university abandoned but learn the Fireflies have moved to a hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah. The two are attacked by bandits and Joel is severely wounded while escaping.\nDuring the winter, Ellie and Joel shelter in the mountains. Joel is on the brink of death and relies on Ellie to care for him. Hunting for food, Ellie encounters David (Nolan North) and James (Reuben Langdon), scavengers willing to trade medicine for food. After David reveals the university bandits were part of his group, Ellie becomes hostile. She leads David's group away from Joel but is captured; David intends to recruit her into his cannibal group. Ellie escapes after killing James, but David corners her in a burning restaurant. Meanwhile, Joel recovers from his wounds and sets out to find Ellie. He reaches her just as she kills David with a machete, an act that traumatizes her, and Joel comforts her before they flee.\nIn the spring, Joel and Ellie arrive in Salt Lake City. Ellie is rendered unconscious after almost drowning before they are captured by a Firefly patrol. In the hospital, Marlene tells Joel that Ellie is being prepared for surgery: in hopes of producing a vaccine for the infection, the Fireflies must remove the infected portion of Ellie's brain, which will kill her. Unwilling to let Ellie die, Joel battles his way to the operating room, kills the lead surgeon, and carries the unconscious Ellie to the parking garage. He is confronted by Marlene, whom he shoots and kills to prevent the Fireflies from pursuing them. On the drive out of the city, when Ellie wakes up, Joel lies and tells her that the Fireflies had found other immune people but were unable to create a cure and have stopped trying. On the outskirts of Tommy's settlement, Ellie expresses her survivor guilt. At her insistence, Joel swears his story about the Fireflies is true."

        "content": "Naughty Dog began developing The Last of Us in 2009, following the release of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. For the first time in the company's history, Naughty Dog split into two teams; while one team developed Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception (2011), the other began work on The Last of Us. Game director Bruce Straley and creative director Neil Druckmann led the team responsible for developing The Last of Us.While at university, Druckmann had an idea to merge the gameplay of Ico (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968), with a lead character similar to John Hartigan from Sin City (1991\u20132000). The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to the lead character's heart condition, players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles. Druckmann later developed it when creating the story of The Last of Us. Druckmann views The Last of Us as a coming-of-age story, in which Ellie adapts to survival after spending time with Joel, as well as an exploration of how willing a father is to save his child.A major motif of the game is that \"life goes on\"; this is presented in a scene in which Joel and Ellie discover a herd of giraffes, which concept artist John Sweeney explained was designed to \"reignite [Ellie's] lust for life\" after her suffering following her encounter with David. The infected, a core concept of the game, were inspired by a segment of the BBC nature documentary Planet Earth (2006), which featured the Cordyceps fungi. Though the fungi mainly infect insects, taking control of their motor functions and forcing them to help cultivate the fungus, the game explores the concept of the fungus evolving and infecting humans, as well as the direct results of an outbreak of this infection.\nThe relationship between Joel and Ellie was the focus of the game; all other elements were developed around it. Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson were cast as Joel and Ellie, respectively, and provided voice and motion capture performances. Baker and Johnson contributed to the development of the characters; for example, Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness, and Johnson convinced Druckmann that Ellie should be stronger and more defensive. Following comparisons to actor Elliot Page, Ellie's appearance was redesigned to better reflect Johnson's personality and make her younger. The game's other characters also underwent changes. The character Tess was originally intended to be the main antagonist, but the team found it difficult to believe her motives. The sexuality of the character Bill was originally left vague in the script but later altered to further reflect his homosexuality.The Last of Us features an original score composed primarily by Gustavo Santaolalla, along with compositions by Andrew Buresh, Anthony Caruso, and Jonathan Mayer. Known for his minimalist compositions, Santaolalla was contacted early in development. He used various instruments to compose the score, including some that he was unfamiliar with, giving a sense of danger and innocence. This minimalist approach was also taken with the game's sound and art design. The sound of the infected was one of the first tasks during development; the team experimented with the sound in order to achieve the best work possible. To achieve the sound of the Clicker, they hired voice actress Misty Lee, who provided a sound that audio lead Phillip Kovats described as originating in the \"back of the throat\". The art department took various pieces of work as inspiration, such as Robert Polidori's photographs following Hurricane Katrina, which were used as a reference point when designing the flooded areas of Pittsburgh. The art department were forced to negotiate for things that they wished to include, due to the strong differing opinions of the team during development. Ultimately, the team settled on a balance between simplicity and detail; while Straley and Druckmann preferred the former, the art team preferred the latter. The game's opening credits were produced by Sony's San Diego Studio.The Last of Us game designer Ricky Cambier cited the video games Ico and Resident Evil 4 as influences on the game design. He said the emotional weight of the relationship needed to be balanced with the tension of the world's issues, stating that they \"wanted to take the character building and interaction\" of Ico and \"blend it with the tension and action of Resident Evil 4.\" The team created new engines to satisfy their needs for the game. The artificial intelligence was created to coordinate with players; the addition of Ellie as artificial intelligence was a major contributor to the engine. The lighting engine was also re-created to incorporate soft light, in which the sunlight seeps in through spaces and reflects off surfaces. The gameplay introduced difficulty to the team, as they felt that every mechanic required thorough analysis. The game's user interface design also underwent various iterations throughout development.The Last of Us was announced on December 10, 2011, at the Spike Video Game Awards, alongside its debut trailer. The announcement ignited widespread anticipation within the gaming industry, which journalists ascribed to Naughty Dog's reputation. The game missed its original projected release date of May 7, 2013, and was pushed to June 14, 2013, worldwide for further polishing. To promote pre-order sales, Naughty Dog collaborated with several retailers to provide special editions of the game with extra content."

Satellites pick up another lightning event not far from the first, and Coulson, with Agents Melinda May and Grant Ward, arrives at the source to find a second body, floating like the first. Civilian hacker and S.H.I.E.L.D. trainee Skye discovers that the two victims were both volunteer firefighters from the same station who responded to the Battle of New York.\nAt the firehouse they discover a third firefighter, Tony Diaz, who can hear a strange humming sound.

It was directed by Jones. The film tells the story of Brian Cohen (played by Chapman), a young Jewish-Roman man who is born on the same day as\u2014and next door to\u2014Jesus, and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah.\nFollowing the withdrawal of funding by EMI Films just days before production was scheduled to begin, George Harrison, the former member of the Beatles and a long-time Python fan, arranged financing for Life of Brian through the formation of his HandMade Films company.The film's themes of religious satire were controversial at the time of its release, drawing accusations of blasphemy and protests from some religious groups. Thirty-nine local authorities in the United Kingdom imposed either an outright ban or an X (18 years) certificate. Some countries, including Ireland and Norway, banned its showing, and in a few of these, such as Italy, bans lasted over a decade. The filmmakers used the notoriety to promote the film, with posters in Sweden reading, \"So funny it was banned in Norway!\"The film was a box office success, the fourth-highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom in 1979, and highest grossing of any British film in the United States that year. It has remained popular and has been named as the greatest comedy film of all time by several magazines and television networks, and it later received a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus reading, \"One of the more cutting-edge films of the 1970s, this religious farce from the classic comedy troupe is as poignant as it is funny and satirical.\" In a 2006 Channel 4 poll, Life of Brian was ranked first on their list of the 50 Greatest Comedy Films."

        "content": "Brian Cohen is born in a stable next door to the one in which Jesus is born, which initially confuses the three wise men who come to praise the future King of the Jews. Brian later grows up into an idealistic young man who resents the continuing Roman occupation of Judea. While listening to Jesus's Sermon on the Mount, Brian becomes infatuated with an attractive young rebel named Judith. His desire for her and hatred of the Romans, further exacerbated by his mother revealing that Brian himself is half-Roman, inspire him to join the \"People's Front of Judea\" (PFJ), one of many fractious and bickering independence movements that spend more time fighting each other than they do the Romans.\nThe PFJ task Brian to paint slogans overnight on Roman governor Pilate's palace, but a Roman officer catches him in the act. The officer shows more concern with Brian's appalling Latin grammar and, after correcting the slogan to \"Romani ite domum\", orders him to write it one hundred times. Brian finishes after sunrise and is chased away by the guards, and rescued by Judith. He then participates in an abortive attempt by the PFJ to kidnap Pilate's wife, but is captured by the palace guards.\nThe guards bring Brian before Pilate, but his questioning is cut short when the guards began laughing at the names of Pilate's friend Biggus Dickus and his wife Incontinentia Buttocks. Escaping, Brian is swooped up by a passing extraterrestrial spaceship, which it crashes back to earth. Brian tries to blend in among prophets who are preaching in a busy plaza, repeating fragments of Jesus' sermons. He stops his sermon mid-sentence when some Roman soldiers depart, leaving his small but intrigued audience demanding to know more. Brian grows frantic when people chase him to the mountains, and there they declare him to be the Messiah. After spending the night with Judith, a naked Brian discovers an enormous crowd assembled outside his mother's house. Her attempts at dispersing the crowd are rebuffed, so she consents to Brian addressing them. He urges them to think for themselves, but they parrot his words as doctrine.\nThe PFJ seek to exploit Brian's celebrity status by having him minister to a thronging crowd of followers demanding miracle cures. Brian sneaks out the back, only to be captured by the Romans and sentenced to crucifixion. In celebration of Passover, a crowd has assembled outside the palace of Pilate, who offers to pardon a prisoner of their choice. The crowd shout out names containing the letter \"r\", mocking Pilate's speech impediment, and are further amused by his friend Biggus's lisp. Eventually, Judith appears in the crowd and calls for the release of Brian, which they echo, and Pilate agrees to \"welease Bwian\".\nThe guards eventually catch up to Brian, who is already crucified. But in a scene that parodies the climax of the film Spartacus, various crucified people all claim to be Brian so they can be freed, and the wrong man is released. Brian is successively approached and then abandoned by the PFJ, a suicide squad of the \"Judean People's Front\", Judith, and his scolding mother. As he despairs, the convict next to him leads the rest in a cheerful song, which Brian joins in (\"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\")."

It makes no difference that some of the routines fall flat because there are always others coming along immediately after that succeed.\" Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, writing, \"What's endearing about the Pythons is their good cheer, their irreverence, their willingness to allow comic situations to develop through a gradual accumulation of small insanities.\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three and a half stars, calling it \"a gentle but very funny parody of the life of Jesus, as well as of biblical movies.\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times declared, \"Even those of us who find Monty Python too hit-and-miss and gory must admit that its latest effort has numerous moments of hilarity.\" Clyde Jeavons of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that the script was \"occasionally over-raucous and crude\", but found the second half of the film \"cumulatively hilarious\", with \"a splendidly tasteless finale, which even Mel Brooks might envy.\" Richard Grenier, writing in the neoconservative magazine Commentary, said \"Life of Brian contains appreciably more mocking of faddish radicalism and Third World 'national-liberation movements' than it does of religion,\" citing numerous examples in the film of satire at the expense of \"left-wing ideas about imperialism, feminism, and terrorism,\" reflecting a satirical omnivorousness that Grenier associated with \"the tradition of what might be called 'Tory wit,' reaching back to Congreve and Swift and all the way forward to Evelyn Waugh and Kingsley Amis.\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post had a negative opinion of the film, writing that it was \"a cruel fiction to foster the delusion that 'Brian' is bristling with blasphemous nifties and throbbing with impious wit.

Another Channel 4 poll in 2001 named it the 23rd greatest film of all time (the only comedy that came higher was Billy Wilder's Some Like It Hot, which was ranked 5th).

There are several groups in the film which oppose the Roman occupation of Judea, but fall into the familiar pattern of intense competition among factions that appears, to an outsider, to be over ideological distinctions so small as to be invisible, thus portraying the phenomenon of the narcissism of small differences. Such disunity indeed fatally beleaguered real-life Judean resistance against Roman rule. Michael Palin says that the various separatist movements were modelled on \"modern resistance groups, all with obscure acronyms which they can never remember and their conflicting agendas\".\nThe People's Front of Judea, composed of the Pythons' characters, harangue their \"rivals\" with cries of \"splitters\" and stand vehemently opposed to the Judean People's Front, the Judean People's Popular Front, the Campaign for a Free Galilee, and the Popular Front of Judea (the last composed of a single old man, mocking the size of real revolutionary Trotskyist factions). The infighting among revolutionary organisations is demonstrated most dramatically when the PFJ attempts to kidnap Pontius Pilate's wife, but encounters agents of the Campaign for a Free Galilee, and the two factions begin a violent brawl over which of them conceived of the plan first. When Brian exhorts them to cease their fighting to struggle \"against the common enemy\", the revolutionaries stop and cry in unison, \"the Judean People's Front!\" However, they soon resume their fighting and, with two Roman legionaries watching bemusedly, continue until Brian is left the only survivor, at which point he is captured.\nOther scenes have the freedom fighters wasting time in debate, with one of the debated items being that they should not waste their time debating so much. There is also a famous scene in which Reg gives a revolutionary speech asking, \"What have the Romans ever done for us?\" at which point the listeners outline all forms of positive aspects of the Roman occupation such as sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, a fresh water system, public health and peace, followed by \"what have the Romans ever done for us except sanitation, medicine, education...\". Python biographer George Perry notes, \"The People's Liberation Front of Judea conducts its meetings as though they have been convened by a group of shop stewards\". This joke is the reverse of a similar conversation recorded in the Babylonian Talmud; some authors have even suggested the joke is based on the Talmudic text."

        "content": "Moonwalker is a 1988 American experimental anthology musical film starring Michael Jackson.

The film is named after the dance technique known as the moonwalk, which Jackson was known for performing.The film was released theatrically in Europe and South America, but Warner Bros. canceled plans for a Christmas 1988 theatrical release in the United States. Moonwalker was released on VHS, and remained #1 on Billboard's Video Chart for 22 weeks. Moonwalker also spent 14 weeks at #1 on Billboards Top Video- Cassette sales chart In 1989, Moonwalker was honoured with a certification of 800,000 copies sold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

During the theatrical release of Moonwalker, Jackson was also embarking on the Bad World Tour, his first tour as a solo performer. The film was released theatrically in Europe and South America, but Warner Bros. canceled plans for a Christmas 1988 theatrical release in the United States. Moonwalker was instead released on home video by CMV Enterprises in the United States and Canada on January 10, 1989, just as the Bad World Tour finished. (His tour was supposed to finish sooner, but had been postponed due to some vocal strain, so it went on until the last week of January 1989.) The video had sold more than 800,000 copies in the United States by April 17, 1989."

        "content": "Due to the large budget, the film had a limited theatrical release and was released in the United States on VHS and LaserDisc almost immediately afterwards. The vignettes featured in the movie also appear in a DVD box set of Michael Jackson music videos titled Michael Jackson's Vision. The set only features the song and dance sequences from \"Smooth Criminal\", the title song, and the ending \"Come Together\" as opposed to the entire short film.\nMoonwalker was released on a region-free Blu-ray in the United Kingdom in June 2010 by Warner Bros. This Blu-ray version contained a new remastered transfer and a DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack. The release has been censored, with the scenes of Mr. Big hitting Katie and threatening to inject her with heroin cut from the film. The Blu-ray was released in its original theatrical 16:9 aspect ratio, different from the previous 4:3 home releases.\nBecause of specific music and film licensing, Moonwalker has yet to be officially released on DVD and/or Blu-ray in North America. However, imported region-free DVD copies of the film from Europe and Asia have surfaced throughout the web. In addition, the film is available to buy worldwide exclusively on the Amazon Prime Video streaming service, although it is based on the 2010 Blu-Ray disc release."
