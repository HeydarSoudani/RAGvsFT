        "content": "Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a 1975 British comedy film inspired by the Arthurian legend, written and performed by the Monty Python comedy group (Chapman, Cleese, Gilliam, Idle, Jones, and Palin), directed by Gilliam and Jones. It was conceived during the hiatus between the third and fourth series of their BBC television series Monty Python's Flying Circus. While the group's first film, And Now for Something Completely Different, was a compilation of sketches from the first two television series, Holy Grail is an original story that parodies the legend of King Arthur's quest for the Holy Grail. Thirty years later, Idle used the film as the basis for the 2005 Tony Award-winning musical Spamalot. Monty Python and the Holy Grail grossed more than any British film exhibited in the US in 1975. In the US, it was selected in 2011 as the second-best comedy of all time in the ABC special Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time behind Airplane! In the UK, readers of Total Film magazine in 2000 ranked it the fifth-greatest comedy film of all time; a similar poll of Channel 4 viewers in 2006 placed it sixth."

        "content": "In AD 932, King Arthur and his squire, Patsy, travel Britain searching for men to join the Knights of the Round Table. Along the way, Arthur debates whether swallows could carry coconuts, passes through a town infected with the Black Death, recounts receiving Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake to two anarcho-syndicalist peasants, defeats the Black Knight and observes an impromptu witch trial. He recruits Sir Bedevere the Wise, Sir Lancelot the Brave, Sir Galahad the Pure, Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot and Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Film, along with their squires and Robin's minstrels. Arthur leads the knights to Camelot, but, after a musical number, changes his mind, deeming it \"a silly place\". As they turn away, God appears and orders Arthur to find the Holy Grail. Arthur and his knights arrive at a castle occupied by French soldiers, who claim to have the Grail and taunt the Britons, driving them back with a barrage of barnyard animals. Bedevere concocts a plan to sneak in using a Trojan Rabbit, but no one hides inside it, and the Britons are forced to flee when it is flung back at them. Arthur decides the knights should go their separate ways to search for the Grail. A modern-day historian filming a documentary on the Arthurian legends is killed by an unknown knight on horseback, triggering a police investigation. On the knights' travels, Arthur and Bedevere are given directions by an old man and attempt to satisfy the strange requests of the dreaded Knights Who Say \"Ni!\". Sir Robin avoids a fight with a Three-Headed Knight by running away while the heads are arguing. Sir Galahad is led by a grail-shaped beacon to Castle Anthrax, which is full of young women, but is unwillingly \"rescued\" by Lancelot. Lancelot receives an arrow-shot note from Swamp Castle. Believing the note is from a lady being forced to marry against her will, he storms the castle and slaughters several members of the wedding party, only to discover the note was from an effeminate prince. Arthur and his knights regroup and are joined by three new knights, as well as Brother Maynard and his monk brethren. They meet Tim the Enchanter, who directs them to a cave where the location of the Grail is said to be written. The entrance to the cave is guarded by the Rabbit of Caerbannog. Underestimating it, the knights attack, but the Rabbit easily kills Sirs Bors, Gawain and Ector. Arthur uses the \"Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch\", provided by Brother Maynard, to destroy the creature. Inside the cave, they find an inscription from Joseph of Arimathea, directing them to Castle Aarrgh. An animated cave monster devours Brother Maynard, but Arthur and the knights escape after the animator unexpectedly suffers a fatal heart attack. The knights approach the Bridge of Death, where the bridge-keeper challenges them to answer three questions to pass, or else be cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril. Lancelot easily answers the simple questions and crosses. Robin is defeated by an unexpectedly difficult question, and Galahad fails an easy one; both are magically flung into the gorge. When the bridge-keeper poses an obscure question about swallows to Arthur, he asks the bridge-keeper to clarify what he means; the bridge-keeper cannot answer and is thrown into the gorge. Arthur and Bedevere cannot find Lancelot, unaware that he has been arrested by police investigating the historian's death. The pair reach Castle Aarrgh, but find it occupied by the French soldiers. After being repelled by showers of manure, they summon an army of knights and prepare to assault the castle. As the army charges, the police arrive, arrest Arthur and Bedevere and break the camera, ending the film."

        "content": "Fifteen months before the BBC visited the set in May 1974, the Monty Python troupe assembled the first version of the screenplay. When half of the resulting material was set in the Middle Ages, and half was set in the present day, the group opted to focus on the Middle Ages, revolving on the legend of the Holy Grail. By the fourth or fifth version of their screenplay, the story was complete, and the cast joked that the fact that the Grail was never retrieved would be \"a big let-down ... a great anti-climax\". Graham Chapman said a challenge was incorporating scenes that did not fit the Holy Grail motif. Neither Terry Gilliam nor Terry Jones had directed a film before, and described it as a learning experience in which they would learn to make a film by making an entire full-length film. The cast humorously described the novice directing style as employing the level of mutual disrespect always found in Monty Python's work. A 2021 tweet by Eric Idle revealed that the film was financed by eight investors: Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson, Holy Grail co-producer Michael White, Heartaches (a cricket team founded by lyricist Tim Rice), and three record companies including Charisma Records, the record label that released Python's early comedy albums. The investors contributed the entire original budget of \u00a3175,350 (about $410,000 in 1974). He added that this group also received a cut of the proceeds from the 2005 musical Spamalot. According to Terry Gilliam, the Pythons turned to rock stars like Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin for finance as the studios refused to fund the film and rock stars saw it as \"a good tax write-off\" due to the top rate of UK income tax being \"as high as 90%\" at the time. It has also been said by Gilliam that Elton John, financed the Holy Grail. Although a 2022 tweet from Eric Idle has stated that this is not true"

        "title": "Monty Python and the Holy Grail_Filming",
        "content": "Monty Python and the Holy Grail was mostly shot on location in Scotland, particularly around Doune Castle, Glen Coe, and the privately owned Castle Stalker. The many castles seen throughout the film were mainly either Doune Castle shot from different angles or hanging miniatures. There are several exceptions to this: the very first exterior shot of a castle at the beginning of the film is Kidwelly Castle in South Wales, and the single exterior shot of the Swamp Castle during \"Tale of Sir Lancelot\" is Bodiam Castle in East Sussex; all subsequent shots of the exterior and interior of those scenes were filmed at Doune Castle. Production designer Julian Doyle recounted that his crew constructed walls in the forest near Doune. Terry Jones later recalled the crew had selected more castles around Scotland for locations, but during the two weeks prior to principal photography, the Scottish Department of the Environment declined permission for use of the castles in its jurisdiction, for fear of damage. At the start of \"The Tale of Sir Robin\", there is a slow camera zoom in on rocky scenery (that in the voice-over is described as \"the dark forest of Ewing\"). This is actually a still photograph of the gorge at Mount Buffalo National Park in Victoria, Australia. Doyle stated in 2000 during an interview with Hotdog magazine that it was a still image filmed with candles underneath the frame (to give a heat haze). This was a low-cost method of achieving a convincing location effect. On the DVD audio commentary, Cleese described challenges shooting and editing Castle Anthrax in \"The Tale of Sir Galahad\", with what he felt the most comedic take being unused because an anachronistic coat was visible in it. Castle Anthrax was also shot in one part of Doune, where costume designer Hazel Pethig advised against nudity, dressing the girls in shifts. In the scene where the knights were combatting the Rabbit of Caerbannog, a real white rabbit was used, switched with puppets for its killings. It was covered with red liquid to simulate blood, though the rabbit's owner did not want the animal dirty and was kept unaware. The liquid was difficult to remove from the fur. He also stated that he thought that, had they been more experienced in filmmaking, the crew would have just purchased a rabbit instead. Regardless, the rabbit itself was unharmed. Also, the rabbit-bite effects were done by special puppetry by both Gilliam and SFX technician John Horton. As chronicled in The Life of Python, The First 20 Years of Monty Python, and The Pythons' Autobiography, Chapman suffered from acrophobia, trembling and bouts of forgetfulness during filming due to his alcoholism, prompting him to refrain from drinking while the production continued in order to remain \"on an even keel\". Nearly three years later, in December 1977, Chapman achieved sobriety. Originally the knight characters were going to ride real horses, but after it became clear that the film's small budget precluded real horses (except for a lone horse appearing in a couple of scenes), the Pythons decided their characters would mime horse-riding while their porters trotted behind them banging coconut shells together. The joke was derived from the old-fashioned sound effect used by radio shows to convey the sound of hooves clattering. This was later referred to in the German release of the film, which translated the title as Die Ritter der Kokosnu\u00df (The Knights of the Coconut). Similarly, the Hungarian title Gyalog galopp translates to \"Galloping on Foot\". The opening credits of the film feature pseudo-Swedish subtitles, which soon turn into an appeal to visit Sweden and see the country's moose. The subtitles are soon stopped, but moose references continue throughout the actual credits until the credits are stopped again and restarted in a different visual style and with references to llamas, animals often mentioned in Flying Circus. The subtitles were written by Michael Palin as a way to \"entertain the 'captive' audience\" at the beginning of the film."

Reportedly, the Pythons were displeased to discover a number of edits were done by the network to reduce use of profanity and the showing of blood. The troupe pulled back the rights and thereafter had it broadcast in the United States only on PBS and later other channels such as Comedy Central and IFC, where it runs uncut."

        "content": "Contemporary reviews were mixed. Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote in a favourable review that the film had \"some low spots,\" but had gags which were \"nonstop, occasionally inspired and should not be divulged, though it's not giving away too much to say that I particularly liked a sequence in which the knights, to gain access to an enemy castle, come up with the idea of building a Trojan rabbit.\" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times was also positive, writing that the film, \"like Mad comics, is not certain to please every taste. But its youthful exuberance and its rousing zaniness are hard not to like. As a matter of fact, the sense of fun is dangerously contagious.\" Penelope Gilliatt of The New Yorker called the film \"often recklessly funny and sometimes a matter of comic genius.\" Other reviews were less enthusiastic. Variety wrote that the storyline was \"basically an excuse for set pieces, some amusing, others overdone.\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two-and-a-half stars, writing that he felt \"it contained about 10 very funny moments and 70 minutes of silence. Too many of the jokes took too long to set up, a trait shared by both Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein. I guess I prefer Monty Python in chunks, in its original, television revue format.\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post called the film \"a fitfully amusing spoof of the Arthurian legends\" but \"rather poky\" in tempo, citing the running gag of Swedish subtitles in the opening credits as an example of how the Pythons \"don't know when to let go of any shtik\". Geoff Brown of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote in a mixed review that \"the team's visual buffooneries and verbal rigamaroles (some good, some bad, but mostly indifferent) are piled on top of each other with no attention to judicious timing or structure, and a form which began as a jaunty assault on the well-made revue sketch and an ingenious misuse of television's fragmented style of presentation, threatens to become as unyielding and unfruitful as the conventions it originally attacked.\""

        "content": "The film's reputation grew over time. In 2000, readers of Total Film magazine voted Holy Grail the fifth-greatest comedy film of all time. The next Python film, Life of Brian, was ranked first. A 2006 poll of Channel 4 viewers on the 50 Greatest Comedy Films saw Holy Grail placed in sixth place (with Life of Brian again topping the list). In 2011, an ABC prime-time special, Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time, counted down the best films chosen by fans based on results of a poll conducted by ABC and People. Holy Grail was selected as the second best comedy after Airplane!. In 2016, Empire magazine ranked Holy Grail 18th in their list of the 100 best British films (Life of Brian was ranked 2nd), their entry stating, \"Elvis ordered a print of this comedy classic and watched it five times. If it's good enough for the King, it's good enough for you.\" In a 2017 interview at Indiana University in Bloomington, John Cleese expressed disappointment with the film's conclusion. \"'The ending annoys me the most'\", he said after a screening of the film on the Indiana campus, adding that \"'It ends the way it does because we couldn't think of any other way'\". However, scripts for the film and notebooks that are among Michael Palin's private archive, which he donated to the British Library in 2017, do document at least one alternate ending that the troupe considered: \"a battle between the knights of Camelot, the French, and the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog\". Due to the film's small production budget, that idea or a \"much pricier option\" was discarded by the Pythons in favour of the ending with \"King Arthur getting arrested\", which Palin deemed \"'cheaper'\" and \"'funnier'\". Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes offers a 97% approval rating from reviews of 78 critics, with an average rating of 8.46/10. The consensus reads, \"A cult classic as gut-bustingly hilarious as it is blithely ridiculous, Monty Python and the Holy Grail has lost none of its exceedingly silly charm.\""

Written primarily by Idle, the show has more of an overarching plot and leaves out certain portions of the movie due to difficulties in rendering certain effects on stage. Nonetheless, many of the jokes from the film are present in the show. In 2013, the Pythons lost a legal case to Mark Forstater, the film's producer, over royalties for the derivative work, Spamalot. They owed a combined \u00a3800,000 in legal fees and back royalties to Forstater. To help cover the cost of these royalties and fees, the group arranged and performed in a stage show, Monty Python Live (Mostly), held at the O2 Arena in London in July 2014. In May 2018, it was announced that 20th Century Fox had green-lit a film adaptation of the musical. Idle would write the screenplay and stage director Casey Nicholaw would direct. Filming was to begin in early 2019 but was delayed due to the acquisition of 20th Century Fox by The Walt Disney Company. On January 6, 2020, it was announced that the project would move to Paramount Pictures and that it was set to begin pre-production, with Idle and Nicholaw still attached as writer and director and Dan Jinks joining as a producer."

        "content": "The eponymous Feeble Variety Hour theatre troupe is rehearsing the title song with hopes of finding success through being picked up for a syndicated television show. Heidi (a hippopotamus), the star of the show, is insulted by pornographic director Trevor (a rat) and complains to her boss and lover, Bletch (a walrus), who is actually in an adulterous relationship with Samantha (a cat). Meanwhile, Robert (a hedgehog), the newest member of the team, arrives at the theatre and immediately falls in love with another newcomer, Lucille (a Pomeranian). Samantha confronts Heidi, insults her, and reveals her relationship with Bletch. Robert confesses his love to Lucille, and the two become engaged. Sid (an elephant) receives a visit from his ex-girlfriend Sandy (a chicken) with his alleged son Seymour (an improbable-looking elephant/chicken hybrid). Sandy informs him she will be preparing a paternity case against him. At the toilet, the second most important star of the show, Harry (a rabbit), is suffering from a mystery disease (later insinuated to be myxomatosis), given only twelve hours to live, and a fly reporter harasses Harry, ultimately reporting his illness to the tabloids. Meanwhile, drug-addicted knife thrower Wynyard (a frog) tells Robert his story of Vietnam, and convinces Robert to give him $50 to buy drugs from Trevor. After seeing Trevor's latest porno film, Bletch decides they need a new porn star, and Trevor chooses Lucille; he drugs her and tries to rape her as an audition but is caught by Robert. When he walks in on the scene Robert thinks that Lucille was drinking and throwing herself at Trevor, and tells her he never wants to see her again. After a good beginning \u2013 the Feebles sign with a TV chain to appear in a prime-time television show \u2013 things begin to go awry during the performance. Wynyard accidentally kills himself during his act, an ailing Harry winds up vomiting all over the stage during his appearance, Sid is accosted by Sandy in the midst of his act which causes it to fall apart, and the show\u2019s organizer, Sebastian (a fox), puts on a number about the act of sodomy (in a poor and desperate attempt to save the show), disgusting the audience. Bletch confesses to Heidi that he actually hates her and wants to give the main role to Samantha. After trying unsuccessfully to commit suicide, Heidi goes on a shooting spree with an M60 machine gun and kills many of the cast; including Samantha (whose taunting drove her into the rampage), Harry (who was told by his doctor that he was indeed going to recover), and Sandy (who demands that Heidi kill Sid, only to be shot dead by her instead). Bletch attempts to talk Heidi into surrendering, but Heidi opens fire on him and he drops from the balcony. Lying injured on the stage, Bletch convinces Heidi to stop her rampage by proclaiming he still loves her and she told him that she already killed Samantha; only for Trevor to shoot her in the shoulder from behind with a shotgun. Bletch, having tricked Heidi into letting her guard down, orders Trevor to revenge on her from killing his new ex-girlfriend, Samantha; only for Robert to intervene by swinging on a rope from the rafters and colliding with Trevor, incapacitating Trevor briefly enough for Heidi to reclaim the machine gun and shoot him dead. Bletch lunges at Heidi in a last ditch effort, but is killed too. From backstage, Arthur (a worm), the show's manager, tells Heidi that he regrettably had to tip off the police about Heidi's shooting rampage. Heidi accepts this and makes one last request before her impending incarceration - to play her musical number, \"The Garden of Love\", to which Arthur complies. The epilogue reveals the fates of only seven survivors: Sid gets extensive repair on his kneecaps after being accidentally shot by Heidi in her rampage and works in an orchard as a struggling horticulturist with his son Seymour. Arthur received an OBE for his lifelong service at the theater and retires to the country. Sebastian recovers from his injuries and became a successful writer who achieved worldwide fame for his best seller The Feeble Variety Massacre: One Man's Act of Heroism! and is currently negotiating film rights. Robert (now an award-winning fashion photographer for a women's magazine) and Lucille are married with two children. Finally, Heidi, whose killing spree resulted in her imprisonment in a women's penitentiary for ten years, has been rehabilitated under the community and now works under a new identity on the check-out counter of a large supermarket."

        "content": "The film was originally conceived as part of a television series, and only belatedly became a feature after Japanese investors proposed expanding it; as such, the script was hastily re-written. The dialogue was recorded before shooting began. Made on an extremely low budget considering the time-consuming process of working with puppets, the film went over budget and schedule. Some scenes, including the Vietnam flashback, were funded by members of the film crew, and filmed secretly under the title Frogs of War. The Vietnam flashback includes a game of Russian roulette as a parody of The Deer Hunter. An initial application for Film Commission money was rejected by executive director Jim Booth, who a short time later became Jackson's producer. The Commission eventually granted the production two-thirds of its $750,000 budget, though relationships between the funders and the production soured and the Film Commission removed its credit from the film. It is often mistakenly stated that there are no human characters in the film; the character Abi is a human. However, there are no real-life human characters in the film. Director Jackson has a cameo as an audience member dressed as an alien from Bad Taste. Every vehicle seen in the film is a variation on the Morris Minor, including a specially constructed limousine. Morris Minors also appear in Jackson's Bad Taste and Braindead. By presumed coincidence, one of the characters, Harry the Hare, shares a name with the title character of James B. Hemesath's short story \"Harry the Hare\" (himself a Bugs Bunny pastiche), written for Harlan Ellison's anthology Again, Dangerous Visions in 1972."

        "content": "The Bridge on the River Kwai is a 1957 epic war film directed by David Lean and based on the 1952 novel written by Pierre Boulle. Although the film uses the historical setting of the construction of the Burma Railway in 1942\u20131943, the plot and characters of Boulle's novel and the screenplay are almost entirely fictional. The cast includes Alec Guinness, William Holden, Jack Hawkins, and Sessue Hayakawa. It was initially scripted by screenwriter Carl Foreman, who was later replaced by Michael Wilson. Both writers had to work in secret, as they were on the Hollywood blacklist and had fled to the UK in order to continue working. As a result, Boulle, who did not speak English, was credited and received the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay; many years later, Foreman and Wilson posthumously received the Academy Award. The Bridge on the River Kwai is widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. It was the highest-grossing film of 1957 and received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics. The film won seven Academy Awards (including Best Picture) at the 30th Academy Awards. In 1997, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress. It has been included on the American Film Institute's list of best American films ever made. In 1999, the British Film Institute voted The Bridge on the River Kwai the 11th greatest British film of the 20th century."

        "content": "In early 1943, a fresh contingent of British POWs arrive at a Japanese prison camp in Thailand, led by Colonel Nicholson. One of the inmates he meets is Commander Shears of the U.S. Navy, who describes the horrific conditions. Nicholson forbids any escape attempts because they were ordered by headquarters to surrender, and escapes could be seen as defiance of orders. Dense jungle surrounding the camp renders escape virtually impossible. Colonel Saito, the camp commandant, informs the new prisoners they will all work, even officers, on the construction of a railway bridge over the River Kwai that will connect Bangkok and Rangoon. Nicholson objects, informing Saito the Geneva Conventions exempts officers from manual labour. After the enlisted men are marched to the bridge site, Saito threatens to have the officers shot, until Major Clipton, the British medical officer, warns Saito there are too many witnesses for him to get away with murder. Saito leaves the officers standing all day in the intense heat. That evening, the officers are placed in a punishment hut, while Nicholson is locked in an iron box after getting beaten as punishment. Shears and two others escape. Only he survives, though he is wounded. He wanders into a Burmese village, is nursed back to health, and eventually reaches the British colony of Ceylon. With the deadline for completion approaching, the work on the bridge is a disaster. The prisoners work as little as possible and sabotage what they can. In addition, the Japanese engineering plans are poor. Should Saito fail to meet the deadline, he would be obliged to commit ritual suicide. Desperate, he uses the anniversary of Japan's 1905 victory in the Russo-Japanese War as an excuse to save face; he announces a general amnesty, releasing Nicholson and his officers and exempting them from manual labour. Nicholson is shocked by the poor job being done by his men and orders the building of a proper bridge, intending it to stand as tribute to the British Army's ingenuity for centuries to come. Clipton objects, believing this to be collaboration with the enemy. Nicholson's obsession with the bridge, which he comes to view as his legacy, eventually drives him to engage the officers as well as the sick and the wounded in manual labor. Shears is enjoying his hospital stay in Ceylon when British Major Warden invites him to join a commando mission to destroy the bridge just as it is completed. Shears tries to get out of the mission by confessing that he impersonated an officer, hoping for better treatment from the Japanese. Warden responds that he already knew and that the U.S. Navy had agreed to transfer him to the British Army to avoid embarrassment. Realising he has no choice, Shears volunteers. The commandos parachute into Thailand. Warden is wounded in an encounter with a Japanese patrol and has to be carried on a litter. He, Shears, and Joyce reach the river in time with the assistance of Siamese women bearers and their village chief, Khun Yai. Under cover of darkness, Shears and Joyce plant explosives on the bridge towers. A train carrying important dignitaries and soldiers is scheduled to be the first to cross the bridge the following day, and Warden's goal is to destroy both. By daybreak, however, the river level has dropped, exposing the wire connecting the explosives to the detonator. Nicholson spots the wire and brings it to Saito's attention. As the train approaches, they hurry down to the riverbank to investigate. Joyce, manning the detonator, breaks cover and stabs Saito to death. Nicholson yells for help, while attempting to stop Joyce from reaching the detonator. When Joyce is mortally wounded by Japanese fire, Shears swims across, but is himself shot. Recognising the dying Shears, Nicholson exclaims, \"What have I done?\" Warden fires a mortar, wounding Nicholson. Dazed, the colonel stumbles toward the detonator and falls on the plunger, blowing up the bridge and sending the train hurtling into the river. Witnessing the carnage, Clipton shakes his head and mutters, \"Madness!\u00a0... Madness!\""

        "content": "The screenwriters, Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson, were on the Hollywood blacklist and, even though living in exile in England, could only work on the film in secret. The two did not collaborate on the script; Wilson took over after Lean was dissatisfied with Foreman's work. The official credit was given to Pierre Boulle (who did not speak English), and the resulting Oscar for Best Screenplay (Adaptation) was awarded to him. Only in 1984 did the Academy rectify the situation by retroactively awarding the Oscar to Foreman and Wilson, posthumously in both cases. Subsequent releases of the film finally gave them proper screen credit. David Lean himself also claimed that producer Sam Spiegel cheated him out of his rightful part in the credits since he had had a major hand in the script. The film was relatively faithful to the novel, with two major exceptions. Shears, who is a British commando officer like Warden in the novel, became an American sailor who escapes from the POW camp. Also, in the novel, the bridge is not destroyed: the train plummets into the river from a secondary charge placed by Warden, but Nicholson (never realising \"what have I done?\") does not fall onto the plunger, and the bridge suffers only minor damage. Boulle nonetheless enjoyed the film version though he disagreed with its climax."

        "content": "Many directors were considered for the project, among them John Ford, William Wyler, Howard Hawks, Fred Zinnemann, and Orson Welles (who was also offered a starring role). The film was an international co-production between companies in Britain and the United States. Director David Lean clashed with his cast members on multiple occasions, particularly Guinness and James Donald, who thought the novel was anti-British. Lean had a lengthy row with Guinness over how to play the role of Nicholson; the actor wanted to play the part with a sense of humour and sympathy, while Lean thought Nicholson should be \"a bore.\" On another occasion, they argued over the scene where Nicholson reflects on his career in the army. Lean filmed the scene from behind Guinness and exploded in anger when Guinness asked him why he was doing this. After Guinness was done with the scene, Lean said, \"Now you can all fuck off and go home, you English actors. Thank God that I'm starting work tomorrow with an American actor (William Holden).\" The film was made in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The bridge in the film was near Kitulgala. The Mount Lavinia Hotel was used as a location for the hospital. Guinness later said that he subconsciously based his walk while emerging from \"the Oven\" on that of his eleven-year-old son Matthew, who was recovering from polio at the time, a disease that left him temporarily paralyzed from the waist down. Guinness later reflected on the scene, calling it the \"finest piece of work\" he had ever done. Lean nearly drowned when he was swept away by the river current during a break from filming. In a 1988 interview with Barry Norman, Lean confirmed that Columbia almost stopped filming after three weeks because there was no white woman in the film, forcing him to add what he called \"a very terrible scene\" between Holden and a nurse on the beach. The filming of the bridge explosion was to be done on 10 March 1957, in the presence of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, then Prime Minister of Ceylon, and a team of government dignitaries. However, cameraman Freddy Ford was unable to get out of the way of the explosion in time, and Lean had to stop filming. The train crashed into a generator on the other side of the bridge and was wrecked. It was repaired in time to be blown up the next morning, with Bandaranaike and his entourage present."

        "content": "British composer Malcolm Arnold recalled that he had \"ten days to write around forty-five minutes worth of music\" \u2013 much less time than he was used to. He described the music for The Bridge on the River Kwai as the \"worst job I ever had in my life\" from the point of view of time. Despite this, he won an Oscar and a Grammy. A memorable feature of the film is the tune that is whistled by the POWs\u2014the first strain of the march \"Colonel Bogey\"\u2014when they enter the camp. Gavin Young recounts meeting Donald Wise, a former prisoner of the Japanese who had worked on the Burma Railway. Young: \"Donald, did anyone whistle Colonel Bogey ... as they did in the film?\" Wise: \"I never heard it in Thailand. We hadn't much breath left for whistling. But in Bangkok I was told that David Lean, the film's director, became mad at the extras who played the prisoners\u2014us\u2014because they couldn't march in time. Lean shouted at them, 'For God's sake, whistle a march to keep time to.' And a bloke called George Siegatz ...  \u2014an expert whistler\u2014began to whistle Colonel Bogey, and a hit was born.\" The march was written in 1914 by Kenneth J. Alford, a pseudonym of British Bandmaster Frederick J. Ricketts. The Colonel Bogey strain was accompanied by a counter-melody using the same chord progressions, then continued with film composer Malcolm Arnold's own composition, \"The River Kwai March\", played by the off-screen orchestra taking over from the whistlers, though Arnold's march was not heard in completion on the soundtrack. Mitch Miller had a hit with a recording of both marches. In many tense, dramatic scenes, only the sounds of nature are used. An example of this is when commandos Warden and Joyce hunt a fleeing Japanese soldier through the jungle, desperate to prevent him from alerting other troops."

        "title": "The Bridge on the River Kwai_Historical accuracy",
        "content": "The plot and characters of Boulle's novel and the screenplay were almost entirely fictional. Since it was not a documentary, there are many historical inaccuracies in the film, as noted by eyewitnesses to the building of the real Burma Railway by historians. The conditions to which POW and civilian labourers were subjected were far worse than the film depicted. According to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission: Lieutenant Colonel Philip Toosey of the British Army was the real senior Allied officer at the bridge in question. Toosey was very different from Nicholson and was certainly not a collaborator who felt obliged to work with the Japanese. Toosey in fact did as much as possible to delay the building of the bridge. While Nicholson disapproves of acts of sabotage and other deliberate attempts to delay progress, Toosey encouraged this: termites were collected in large numbers to eat the wooden structures, and the concrete was badly mixed. Some consider the film to be an insulting parody of Toosey. On a BBC Timewatch programme, a former prisoner at the camp states that it is unlikely that a man like the fictional Nicholson could have risen to the rank of lieutenant colonel, and, if he had, due to his collaboration  he would have been \"quietly eliminated\" by the other prisoners. Julie Summers, in her book The Colonel of Tamarkan, writes that Boulle, who had been a prisoner of war in Thailand, created the fictional Nicholson character as an amalgam of his memories of collaborating French officers. He strongly denied the claim that the book was anti-British, although many involved in the film itself (including Alec Guinness) felt otherwise. Ernest Gordon, a survivor of the railway construction and POW camps described in the novel/film, stated in his 1962 book, Through the Valley of the Kwai: A 1969 BBC television documentary, Return to the River Kwai, made by former POW John Coast, sought to highlight the real history behind the film (partly through getting ex-POWs to question its factual basis, for example Dr Hugh de Wardener and Lt-Col Alfred Knights), which angered many former POWs. The documentary itself was described by one newspaper reviewer when it was shown on Boxing Day 1974 (The Bridge on the River Kwai had been shown on BBC1 on Christmas Day 1974) as \"Following the movie, this is a rerun of the antidote.\" Some of the characters in the film use the names of real people who were involved in the Burma Railway. Their roles and characters, however, are fictionalised. For example, a Sergeant-Major Risaburo Saito was in real life second in command at the camp. In the film, a Colonel Saito is camp commandant. In reality, Risaburo Saito was respected by his prisoners for being comparatively merciful and fair towards them. Toosey later defended him in his war crimes trial after the war, and the two became friends. Some Japanese viewers resented the movie's depiction of their engineers' capabilities as inferior and less advanced than they were in reality. Japanese engineers had been surveying and planning the route of the railway since 1937, and they had demonstrated considerable skill during their construction efforts across South-East Asia. Some Japanese viewers also disliked the film for portraying the Allied prisoners of war as more capable of constructing the bridge than the Japanese engineers themselves were, accusing the filmmakers of being unfairly biased and unfamiliar of realities of the bridge construction, a sentiment echoed by surviving prisoners of war who saw the film in cinemas. The major railway bridge described in the novel and film did not actually cross the river known at the time as the Kwai. However, in 1943 a railway bridge was built by Allied POWs over the Mae Klong river \u2013 renamed Khwae Yai in the 1960s as a result of the film \u2013 at Tha Ma Kham, five kilometres from Kanchanaburi, Thailand. Boulle had never been to the bridge. He knew that the railway ran parallel to the Kwae for many miles, and he therefore assumed that it was the Kwae which it crossed just north of Kanchanaburi. This was an incorrect assumption. The destruction of the bridge as depicted in the film is also entirely fictional. In fact, two bridges were built: a temporary wooden bridge and a permanent steel/concrete bridge a few months later. Both bridges were used for two years, until they were destroyed by Allied bombing. The steel bridge was repaired and is still in use today."

The site's critical consensus reads, \"This complex war epic asks hard questions, resists easy answers, and boasts career-defining work from star Alec Guinness and director David Lean.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 87 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Bosley Crowther of The New York Times praised the film as \"a towering entertainment of rich variety and revelation of the ways of men\". Mike Kaplan, reviewing for Variety, described it as \"a gripping drama, expertly put together and handled with skill in all departments.\" Kaplan further praised the actors, especially Alec Guinness, later writing \"the film is unquestionably\" his. William Holden was also credited for his acting for giving a solid characterization that was \"easy, credible and always likeable in a role that is the pivot point of the story\". Edwin Schallert of the Los Angeles Times claimed the film's strongest points were for being \"excellently produced in virtually all respects and that it also offers an especially outstanding and different performance by Alec Guinness. Highly competent work is also done by William Holden, Jack Hawkins and Sessue Hayakawa\". Time magazine praised Lean's directing, noting he demonstrates \"a dazzlingly musical sense and control of the many and involving rhythms of a vast composition. He shows a rare sense of humor and a feeling for the poetry of situation; and he shows the even rarer ability to express these things, not in lines but in lives.\" Harrison's Reports described the film as an \"excellent World War II adventure melodrama\" in which the \"production values are first-rate and so is the photography.\" Among retrospective reviews, Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, noting that it is one of the few war movies that \"focuses not on larger rights and wrongs but on individuals\", but commented that the viewer is not certain what is intended by the final dialogue due to the film's shifting points of view. Slant magazine gave the film four out of five stars. Slant stated that \"the 1957 epic subtly develops its themes about the irrationality of honor and the hypocrisy of Britain's class system without ever compromising its thrilling war narrative\", and in comparing to other films of the time said that Bridge on the River Kwai \"carefully builds its psychological tension until it erupts in a blinding flash of sulfur and flame.\" Balu Mahendra, the Tamil film director, observed the shooting of this film at Kitulgala, Sri Lanka during his school trip and was inspired to become a film director. Warren Buffett said it was his favorite movie. In an interview, he said that \"[t]here were a lot of lessons in that... The ending of that was sort of the story of life. He created the railroad. Did he really want the enemy to come in across it?\" Some Japanese viewers have disliked the film's depiction of the Japanese characters and the historical background presented as being inaccurate, particularly in the interactions between Saito and Nicholson. In particular, they objected to the implication presented in the film that Japanese military engineers were generally unskilled at their profession and lacked proficiency. In reality, Japanese engineers proved to be just as capable at construction efforts as their Allied counterparts."

        "content": "In 1972, the movie was among the first selection of films released on the early Cartrivision video format, alongside classics such as The Jazz Singer and Sands of Iwo Jima. As early as 1981, the film was released on VHS and Betamax in a two-tape format; the first tape lasting about 100 minutes long and the second tape lasting about an hour on both VHS and Beta. In 1983, the film was put onto a two-part  CED set. Around the same time, the film experienced its first Laserdisc release. Around 1986, with the widespread release of longer VHS tapes (such as the T-160 VHS), The Bridge on the River Kwai got a single-tape VHS and Betamax release; the move from double-tape to single-tape would be permanent. The film was restored in 1985 by Columbia Pictures. The separate dialogue, music and effects were located and remixed with newly recorded \"atmospheric\" sound effects. The image was restored by OCS, Freeze Frame, and Pixel Magic with George Hively editing. Around the same time, Columbia Pictures would re-release the restored movie on VHS in the Columbia Classics Studio Heritage Collection, followed a few years later by its first DVD re-release and a widescreen VHS release. On 2 November 2010 Columbia Pictures released a newly restored The Bridge on the River Kwai for the first time on Blu-ray. According to Columbia Pictures, they followed an all-new 4K digital restoration from the original negative with newly restored 5.1 audio. The original negative for the feature was scanned at 4k (roughly four times the resolution in High Definition), and the colour correction and digital restoration were also completed at 4k. The negative itself manifested many of the kinds of issues one would expect from a film of this vintage: torn frames, embedded emulsion dirt, scratches through every reel, colour fading. Unique to this film, in some ways, were other issues related to poorly made optical dissolves, the original camera lens and a malfunctioning camera. These problems resulted in a number of anomalies that were very difficult to correct, like a ghosting effect in many scenes that resembles colour mis-registration, and a tick-like effect with the image jumping or jerking side-to-side. These issues, running throughout the film, were addressed to a lesser extent on various previous DVD releases of the film and might not have been so obvious in standard definition."

This spoof of the film was based on the script for the 1957 Goon Show episode \"An African Incident\". Shortly before its release, for legal reasons, producer George Martin edited out the 'K' every time the word 'Kwai' was spoken. The comedy team of Wayne and Shuster performed a sketch titled \"Kwai Me a River\" on their 27 March 1967 TV show, in which an officer in the British Dental Corps (Wayne) is captured by the Japanese and, despite being comically unintimidated by any abuse the commander of the POW camp (Shuster) inflicts on him, is forced to build a (dental) \"bridge on the river Kwai\" for the commander and plans to include an explosive in the appliance to detonate in his mouth. The commander survives the explosion, attributed to a toothpaste commercial punchline in 1960s commercials. Billy Joel mentions it in his 1989 song \"We Didn't Start the Fire\". Ron Swanson, a character in the television series Parks and Recreation, mentions The Bridge on the River Kwai as one of the few movies he has seen and a viewing of it is given to him as a birthday present."

        "content": "Toy Story is a 1995 American computer-animated comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The first installment in the  Toy Story franchise, it was the first entirely computer-animated feature film, as well as the first feature film from Pixar. The film was directed by John Lasseter (in his feature directorial debut) and written by Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen, and Alec Sokolow from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, Pete Docter, and Joe Ranft. The film features music by Randy Newman, was produced by Bonnie Arnold and Ralph Guggenheim, and was executive-produced by Steve Jobs and Edwin Catmull. The film features the voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney, Annie Potts, R. Lee Ermey, John Morris, Laurie Metcalf, and Erik von Detten. Taking place in a world where toys come to life when humans are not present, the plot focuses on the relationship between an old-fashioned pull-string cowboy doll named Woody and a modern astronaut action figure, Buzz Lightyear, as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections of their owner, Andy Davis, to friends who work together to be reunited with Andy after being separated from him. Following the success of their 1988 short film Tin Toy, Pixar was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature film told from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote early story treatments, which were rejected by Disney, who wanted the film's tone to be \"edgier\". After several disastrous story reels, production was halted and the script was rewritten to better reflect the tone and theme Pixar desired: \"toys deeply want children to play with them, and ... this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions\". The studio, then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced the film under only minor financial constraints. Toy Story premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles, California, on November 19, 1995, and was released in theaters in North America on November 22, 1995. It was the highest-grossing film during its opening weekend, eventually grossing over $373 million worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of 1995. The film received critical acclaim, and holds a rare 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It was praised for the technical innovation of the 3D animation, wit and thematic sophistication of the screenplay, musical score, and vocal performances (particularly Hanks and Allen); it is considered by many to be one of the best animated films ever made. The film received three Academy Award nominations (Best Original Screenplay (the first animated film to be nominated for this award), Best Original Song for \"You've Got a Friend in Me\", and Best Original Score) as well as winning a Special Achievement Academy Award. Deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress, Toy Story was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2005. The success of Toy Story launched a multimedia franchise and a series of three sequels, starting with Toy Story 2 (1999)."

        "content": "A group of living toys, who assume lifelessness around humans, are preparing to move into a new house with their owner Andy Davis, his sister Molly and their single mother. The toys become uneasy when Andy has his birthday party a week early; to calm them, Sheriff Woody, Andy's favorite toy and their leader, sends Sarge and his green army men to spy on the gift opening with a baby monitor. The other toys (which include Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, Rex the tyrannosaur, Hamm the piggy bank, and Bo Peep the porcelain doll) are relieved when Andy receives nothing that could replace them. Andy then receives a last-minute surprise gift \u2013 a Buzz Lightyear action figure who believes he is a real space ranger. Buzz impresses the other toys with his various features and becomes Andy's new favorite, making Woody jealous. Two days before the move, Andy's family plans for a dinner at Pizza Planet, where Andy is allowed to bring along only one toy. To ensure Andy chooses him and not Buzz, Woody tries to use the radio-controlled car RC to knock Buzz behind the desk, but accidentally knocks him out a window instead. The other toys (except for Bo and Slinky) believe Woody deliberately tried to kill Buzz, but Andy arrives and takes Woody before they can exact revenge. A vengeful Buzz stows away in the car, and confronts Woody when the car stops at a gas station on the way to Pizza Planet. The two fight, fall out of the car, and are left behind. After a further argument, the two hitch a ride on a Pizza Planet delivery truck and sneak into the restaurant. Buzz mistakenly believes a claw crane full of Little Green Men to be a true rocket, and Woody climbs in after him. Andy's sadistic next-door neighbor Sid spots and captures the two and takes them to his house, where they encounter his Bull Terrier Scud and his much-abused \"mutant\" toys made from parts of other toys he has destroyed. As Woody tries to find an escape route, Buzz is shocked by a TV commercial that reveals he is indeed a toy. In denial, he attempts to fly, but breaks his arm off and falls into despair. After Sid's toys fix Buzz, Sid returns and tapes Buzz to a rocket, but a thunderstorm forces him to delay the launch until the next morning. Overnight, Woody helps Buzz realize that his purpose is making Andy happy, restoring Buzz's resolve. Sid takes Buzz out to launch him, but Woody rallies the mutant toys to frighten Sid into never harming toys again, freeing Buzz. Woody and Buzz pursue Andy's moving truck, but Scud sees them and gives chase, biting Woody. Buzz fights off Scud, while Woody, freed, climbs into the truck and pushes RC out, using him to distract Scud and rescue Buzz. The other toys, thinking Woody is now trying to get rid of RC, toss Woody back into the street. Having escaped Scud, Buzz and Woody pursue the truck on RC, and the other toys spot them coming and realize their error. During the chase, RC's batteries run out, forcing Woody to ignite the rocket still strapped to Buzz. As they launch towards the truck, they become airborne, and Woody drops RC into the truck. Buzz opens his wings to sever the tape just before the rocket explodes; he and Woody glide over the truck and fall through the sunroof of Andy's car, landing safely beside Andy. At Christmas, in the new house, Sarge and his men spy on the gift opening again while the other toys wait. Mr. Potato Head is delighted when Molly gets a Mrs. Potato Head, and Woody and Buzz jokingly ponder what gift could be \"worse\" than Buzz, only to nervously smile at each other when Andy gets a dachshund puppy."

        "content": "John Lasseter's first experience with computer animation was during his work as an animator at Walt Disney Feature Animation, when two of his friends showed him the light-cycle scene from Tron. It was an eye-opening experience that awakened Lasseter to the possibilities offered by the new medium of computer-generated animation. Lasseter tried to pitch The Brave Little Toaster as a fully computer-animated film to Disney, but the idea was rejected and Lasseter was fired. He then went on to work at Lucasfilm and in 1986, he became a founding member of Pixar. In 1986, Pixar was purchased by entrepreneur and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs. At Pixar, Lasseter created short, computer-animated films to show off the Pixar Image Computer's capabilities. In 1988, Lasseter produced the short film Tin Toy told from the perspective of a toy, referencing Lasseter's love of classic toys. It won the 1989 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, the first computer-generated film to do so. Tin Toy gained Disney's attention, and the new team at The Walt Disney Company\u2014CEO Michael Eisner and chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg in the film division\u2014began a quest to get Lasseter to come back. Lasseter, grateful for Jobs' faith in him, felt compelled to stay with Pixar, telling co-founder Ed Catmull, \"I can go to Disney and be a director, or I can stay here and make history.\" Katzenberg realized he could not lure Lasseter back to Disney and therefore set plans into motion to ink a production deal with Pixar to produce a film.  Disney had always made all their movies in-house and refused to change this. But when Tim Burton, who used to work at Disney, wanted to buy back the rights to The Nightmare Before Christmas, Disney struck a deal allowing him to make it as a Disney film outside the studio. This opened the door for Pixar to make their movies outside Disney. Both sides were willing. Catmull and fellow Pixar co-founder Alvy Ray Smith had long wanted to produce a computer-animated feature, but only by the early 1990s were the computers cheap and powerful enough to make this possible. In addition, Disney had licensed Pixar's Computer Animation Production System (CAPS), and that made it the largest customer for Pixar's computers. Jobs made it apparent to Katzenberg that although Disney was happy with Pixar, it was not the other way around: \"We want to do a film with you,\" said Jobs. \"That would make us happy.\" Catmull, Smith, and head of animation Ralph Guggenheim met with Walt Disney Feature Animation president Peter Schneider in the summer of 1990 to discuss making a feature film, but they found the atmosphere to be puzzling and contentious. They later learned that while Katzenberg was pushing the idea of working with Pixar, Schneider didn't want to bring in a non-Disney animation studio. Katzenberg arranged to meet directly with the Pixar contingent, this time including Lasseter and Jobs. The Pixar team proposed a Christmas television special, A Tin Toy Christmas, as a first step, but Katzenberg countered that as long as they were gearing up to transition from 30-second commercials to a half-hour special, they might as well go all the way and make a feature-length film. Katzenberg also made it clear that he was only working with Pixar to get access to Lassiter's talents, He also made it clear to the Pixar team that they were signing up to work with a self-described \"tyrant\" and micro-manager, but invited them to talk with Disney's animators and get their opinions on working under him. Lasseter was impressed with what he heard, and the two companies began negotiations, although they disagreed on key points including whether Disney would get the rights to Pixar's animation technology or whether Pixar would retain partial ownership of the films, characters, and home video and sequel rights. As Pixar was nearing bankruptcy and desperate for funds, they settled on a deal that would allow Disney to have complete ownership and control of the films and characters, including the rights to make sequels without Pixar's involvement, while Pixar would get approximately 12.5% of ticket sales. These early negotiations became a point of contention between Jobs and Eisner for many years. An agreement to produce a feature film based on Tin Toy with a working title of Toy Story was finalized, and production began soon thereafter."

        "title": "Toy Story_Writing",
        "content": "Originally, the movie was going to star \"Tinny\", the wind-up one-man band toy from the Tin Toy short, along with \"the dummy\", a ventriloquist's dummy. While the premise of the film was still about toys' desire to be played with by children, the rest of the script, which involved Tinny being left behind at a gas station, meeting up with the dummy, and having a series of adventures before finding their way into a kindergarten classroom where they can be played with every day, was quite different. Katzenberg was unhappy with the treatment drafted by Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, and Pete Docter, as the two character's motivations were too similar. Instead, he encouraged them to write it as a buddy film, giving the two main characters contrasting personalities, and having them only become friends after being forced to work together. Lasseter, Stanton, and Doctor delivered a revised treatment in September 1991 that more closely resembles the final film: Tinny replaces the ventriloquist dummy as a child's favorite toy, their bickering causes them to be left behind at a gas station, they almost catch up to the family at a pizza restaurant, they have to escape a kid that mutilates toys, and the movie ends with a chase scene as the two toys try to catch up to the family's moving van. The script went through many changes before the final version. Lasseter decided Tinny was \"too antiquated\"; the character was first changed to a military action figure and then given a space theme. Tinny's name changed to Lunar Larry, then Tempus from Morph, and eventually Buzz Lightyear (after astronaut Buzz Aldrin). Lightyear's design was modeled on the suits worn by Apollo astronauts as well as G.I. Joe action figures. Also, the green and purple color scheme on Lightyear's suit was inspired by Lasseter and his wife, Nancy, whose favorite colors are green and purple, respectively. Woody was inspired by a Casper the Friendly Ghost doll that Lasseter had when he was a child; he was a ventriloquist's dummy with a pull-string (hence the name Woody). This was until character designer Bud Luckey suggested that Woody could be changed to a cowboy ventriloquist dummy. Lasseter liked the contrast between the Western and the science fiction genres and the character immediately changed. Eventually, all the ventriloquist dummy aspects of the character were deleted as the dummy looked \"sneaky and mean\". However they kept the name Woody to pay homage to the Western actor Woody Strode. The story department drew inspiration from films such as Midnight Run and The Odd Couple, and Lasseter screened Hayao Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky for further influence. Since Toy Story's script writers had little experience with feature films, they attended a seminar given by screenwriter Robert McKee. They were inspired by his guidance, based on Aristotle's Poetics, that the main character in a story should be defined by how they react to the obstacles they face, and that it is those obstacles that make characters interesting. Disney also appointed the duo Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow and, later, Joss Whedon to help develop the script. Whedon thought the while script didn't work, it had \"a great structure\". He added the character of Rex and sought a pivotal role for a Barbie doll; the latter transformed into Bo Peep as Mattel would not license the character. Whedon also re-visioned Buzz Lightyear from being a dim-witted but cheerful and self-aware character to an action figure who isn't aware that he's a toy\u2014an epiphany that transformed the film. A brainstorming session with members of Disney Animation's creative team resulted in the addition of the three-eyed squeaky toy aliens."

        "content": "Katzenberg approved the script on January 19, 1993, at which point voice casting began. Paul Newman, who subsequently accepted the role of Doc Hudson in another Pixar film, Cars, was considered for the role of Woody. Robin Williams and Clint Eastwood were also considered for the role. Lasseter always wanted Tom Hanks to play the character of Woody. Lasseter claimed that Hanks \"has the ability to take emotions and make them appealing. Even if the character, like the one in A League of Their Own, is down-and-out and despicable.\" To gauge how an actor's voice might fit with a character, Lasseter borrowed a common Disney technique: animate a vocal monologue from a well-established actor to meld the actor's voice with the appearance or actions of the animated character. This early test footage, using Hanks' voice from Turner & Hooch, convinced Hanks to sign on to the film. Billy Crystal was approached to play Buzz, and was given his own monolog, utilizing dialogue from When Harry Met Sally. However, he turned down the role, believing the film would be unsuccessful due to its animation. Crystal regretted this upon seeing the film; he subsequently accepted the role of Mike Wazowski in another Pixar film, Monsters, Inc.. In addition to Crystal, Bill Murray, Chevy Chase and Jim Carrey, along with a number of other actors, were also considered for the role of Buzz. Lasseter took the role to Tim Allen, who was appearing in Disney's Home Improvement, and he accepted. Crystal later stated in an interview that he would not have been right as Buzz, and that Allen was \"fantastic\" in the role. Before Wallace Shawn and Jim Varney were cast as Rex and Slinky Dog, Rick Moranis and John Cleese were originally considered for the roles. To cast Andy, Pixar held an open call for young male actors to bring a toy with them. Morris brought multiple toys, specifically 45 X-Men figures, contrary to the instructions of bringing just one, and Pixar re-acted to his dumping of the toys with laughter. Toy Story was both Hanks's and Allen's first animated film, and they recorded their lines together to make their characters' chemistry and interactions realistic."

        "content": "Every couple of weeks, Lasseter and his team showed Disney their latest storyboards or footage. Pixar impressed Disney with its technical innovation, but convincing Disney of the plot was more difficult. Katzenberg discarded most of Pixar's script ideas, giving his own extensive notes. Katzenberg wanted primarily to add \"more edginess\" to the two main characters. Disney wanted the film to appeal to both children and adults, and they asked for adult references to be added to the film. The characters ended up being stripped of their charm, with Hanks, while recording Woody's dialogue for the story reels, complaining that the character had been made into a \"real jerk\". Pixar screened the first half of the film for Disney executives on November 19, 1993\u2014an event they later dubbed the \"Black Friday Incident\". The results were disastrous, and Disney's head of feature animation, Peter Schneider, halted production. Katzenberg asked colleague Thomas Schumacher why the reels were bad, to which Schumacher answered, \"Because it's not their movie anymore; it's completely not the movie that John set out to make.\" Lasseter was embarrassed by the current state of the film, later recalling, \"It was a story filled with the most unhappy, mean characters that I've ever seen.\" Katzenberg allowed him to take the script back to Pixar for rewrites, and the production crew shifted to television commercials while the head writers worked out a new script, being funded personally by Jobs until Disney resumed production. Although Lasseter attempted to keep morale high by remaining outwardly buoyant, the production shutdown was \"a very scary time\", recalled story department manager BZ Petroff. Schneider appealed directly to Eisner to cancel the project altogether. Stanton and the other story artists worked to quickly produce new script pages, with help from consultants such as Whedon, and the revisions were completed in two weeks as promised. Pixar's script rewrites took three months, and saw Woody transformed from a tyrant to a wise leader. It also included a more adult-oriented staff meeting amongst the toys rather than the juvenile group discussion that had existed in earlier drafts. Buzz Lightyear's character was also changed \"to make it more clear to the audience that he really doesn't realize he's a toy\". Katzenberg and Schneider resumed production with the new script by February 1994, and the voice actors returned one month later to record their new lines. The crew grew from 24 people to 110, and now included 27 animators and 22 technical directors. In comparison, The Lion King, released in 1994, required a budget of $45\u00a0million and a staff of 800. In the early budgeting process, Jobs was eager to produce the film as efficiently as possible, impressing Katzenberg with his focus on cost-cutting. However, the $17\u00a0 million production budget was no longer going to be sufficient, and Jobs demanded more funds from Disney to compensate them for the time lost in rewrites based on Katzenberg's notes. Catmull was able to reach a compromise on a new budget, but the incident led Jobs to rethink their deal with Disney."

        "content": "Recruiting animators for Toy Story was brisk; the magnet for talent was not mediocre pay but the allure of taking part in the first computer-animated feature. Lasseter said of the challenges of computer animation, \"We had to make things look more organic. Every leaf and blade of grass had to be created. We had to give the world a sense of history. So the doors are banged up, the floors have scuffs.\" The film began with animated storyboards to guide the animators in developing the characters. 27 animators worked on the film, using 400 computer models to animate the characters. Each character was first either created out of clay or modeled from a computer-drawn diagram before reaching the computer-animated design. Once the animators had a model, its articulation and motion controls were coded; this allowed each character to move in a variety of ways, such as talking, walking, or jumping. Out of all the characters, Woody was the most complex, as he required 723 motion controls, including 212 for his face and 58 for his mouth. The first piece of animation, a 30-second test, was delivered to Disney in June 1992, when the company requested a sample of what the film would look like. Lasseter wanted to impress Disney with several things in the test that could not be done in traditional, hand-drawn animation, such as Woody's yellow plaid shirt with red stripes, the reflections in Buzz's helmet and the decals on his spacesuit, or Venetian blind shadows falling across Andy's room. There were 8 teams responsible for different aspects of every shot. The art department was responsible for determining the overall color and lighting scheme. The layout department was responsible for determining the position of all elements of the shot, as well as programming the virtual camera's position and movements. The animation department created the movements of the characters, generally with one animator being assigned to animate an entire shot, but occasionally with each character having its own animator. The shading team used Pixar's RenderMan software to assign surface textures and reflectivity properties to objects. The lighting team placed global, spot, and flood lighting within the scenes. The \"Render Farm\" used Sun Microsystems computers, running around the clock, to produce the final frames of the film. The camera team recorded the finished frames, which had been rendered at a resolution of 1536 by 922, onto film stock. Finally, Skywalker Sound mixed sound effects, the musical score, and the dialogue to create the audio for the film. In order to make the movie feel as realistic as possible, the layout department, led by Craig Good, avoided the sweeping camera shots popular in computer animation at the time, and instead focused on emulating what would've been possible had the movie been shot in live-action with real film cameras. The animation department, led by Rich Quade and Ash Brannon, used Pixar's Menv software to hand pose the characters at key frames based on videotape of the actors recording their lines, and let the software do the inbetweening. To sync the characters' mouths and facial expressions to the actors' recorded voices, animators spent a week per eight seconds of animation, as Lasseter felt that automatic lip syncing couldn't properly convey a character's emotions. The shading team, led by Tom Porter, used scans of real objects, as well as textures drawn by artists and created with procedural generation algorithms, to \"dress\" the objects in the film. The film required 800,000 machine hours and 114,240 frames of animation in total, divided between 1,561 shots that totaled over 77 minutes. Pixar was able to render less than 30 seconds of the film per day."

Buddy movies are about sublimating, punching an arm, 'I hate you.' It's not about open emotion.\" However, Disney had had much success with incorporating Broadway-style musical numbers into their animated film, and encouraged Pixar to do the same. As a compromise, although the characters would not sing, the movie would feature non-diegetic songs as background music. Randy Newman was hired, and composed three original songs for the film. The film's signature song \"You've Got a Friend in Me\", was written in one day. On Newman, Lasseter said, \"His songs are touching, witty, and satirical, and he would deliver the emotional underpinning for every scene.\" Newman wrote  The soundtrack for Toy Story was produced by Walt Disney Records and was released on November 22, 1995, the week of the film's release."

Some animators felt the film would be a significant disappointment commercially but felt animators and animation fans would find it interesting. According to Lee Unkrich, one of the editors of Toy Story, a scene cut out of the original final edit featured Sid torturing Buzz and Woody violently at his house; Unkrich decided to cut right into the scene where Sid is interrogating Woody because the film's creators thought the audience would love Buzz and Woody by that point. Another scene, in which Woody tried to get Buzz's attention when he was stuck in the box crate, was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the film. Schneider had grown optimistic about the film as it neared completion, and he announced a United States release date of November, coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter holiday season. Sources indicate that Jobs lacked confidence in the film during its production, and had been exploring the possibility of selling Pixar to companies such as Hallmark Cards and Microsoft. However, as the film progressed, Jobs, like Schneider, became increasingly passionate about the film and the transformative nature of what Pixar might be able to accomplish. Eager for Pixar to have the funds necessary to negotiate with Disney as an equal partner, and optimistic about the impact the finished film would have, Jobs decided that he would schedule an initial public offering (IPO) of Pixar just a week after the film's November release. Editors, including Lee Unkrich, worked on the film up until September 1995 deadline to deliver a final cut for scoring and sound design. They cut a scene that featured Sid torturing Buzz and Woody violently at his house because the film's creators thought the audience would love Buzz and Woody by that point. Another scene, in which Woody tried to get Buzz's attention when he was stuck in the box crate, was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the film. A test screening in July 1995 got encouraging responses from the audience, but the film was not rated as highly as had been hoped, leading to another last-minute round of edits. Eisner, who attended the screening, suggested that the final shot of the film should be of both Woody and Buzz, leading to the film's final shot of the two worried about the arrival of Andy's new puppy."

Marketing consultant Al Ries reflected on the promotion: \"This will be a killer deal. How can a kid, sitting through a one-and-a-half-hour movie with an army of recognizable toy characters, not want to own one?\" Despite this, Disney Consumer Products was slow to see the potential of Toy Story. When the Thanksgiving release date was announced in January 1995, many toy companies were accustomed to having eighteen months to two years of lead time and passed on the project. Disney shopped the film at the Toy Fair trade show in February 1995, where only the small Canadian company Thinkway Toys, was interested in licensing the toy rights for the Toy Story characters. Disney promoted the film by inserting its trailer into the home-video re-release of Cinderella, showing a behind-the-scenes documentary on the Disney Channel, and incorporating the characters into a parade at the Disney-MGM Studios theme park in Florida. It was screenwriter Joss Whedon's idea to incorporate Barbie as a character who could rescue Woody and Buzz in the film's final act. The idea was dropped after Mattel objected and refused to license the toy. Producer Ralph Guggenheim claimed that Mattel did not allow the use of the toy as \"They [Mattel] philosophically felt girls who play with Barbie dolls are projecting their personalities onto the doll. If you give the doll a voice and animate it, you're creating a persona for it that might not be every little girl's dream and desire.\" Hasbro likewise refused to license G.I. Joe (mainly because Sid was going to blow one up, prompting the filmmakers to instead use a fictional toy, Combat Carl), but they did license Mr. Potato Head. The only toy in the movie that was not in production was Slinky Dog, which had been discontinued since the 1970s. When designs for Slinky were sent to Betty James (Richard James's wife) she said that Pixar had improved the toy and that it was \"cuter\" than the original."

        "content": "On October 2, 2009, the film was re-released in Disney Digital 3-D. The film was also released with Toy Story 2 as a double feature for a two-week run which was extended due to its success. In addition, the film's second sequel, Toy Story 3, was also released in the 3-D format. Lasseter commented on the new 3-D re-release: The Toy Story films and characters will always hold a very special place in our hearts and we're so excited to be bringing this landmark film back for audiences to enjoy in a whole new way thanks to the latest in 3-D technology. With Toy Story 3 shaping up to be another great adventure for Buzz, Woody, and the gang from Andy's room, we thought it would be great to let audiences experience the first two films all over again and in a brand new way. Translating the film into 3-D involved revisiting the original computer data and virtually placing a second camera into each scene, creating left eye and right eye views needed to achieve the perception of depth. Unique to computer animation, Lasseter referred to this process as \"digital archaeology\". The process took four months, as well as an additional six months for the two films to add the 3-D. The lead stereographer Bob Whitehill oversaw this process and sought to achieve an effect that affected the emotional storytelling of the film: When I would look at the films as a whole, I would search for story reasons to use 3-D in different ways. In Toy Story, for instance, when the toys were alone in their world, I wanted it to feel consistent with a safer world. And when they went out to the human world, that's when I really blew out the 3-D to make it feel dangerous and deep and overwhelming. Unlike other countries, the United Kingdom received the films in 3-D as separate releases. Toy Story was released on October 2, 2009. Toy Story 2 was instead released January 22, 2010. The re-release performed well at the box office, opening with $12,500,000 in its opening weekend, placing at the third position after Zombieland and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. The double feature grossed $30.7\u00a0million in its five-week release."

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. Particular praise was offered for the film's 3D animation. Leonard Klady of Variety commended its \"razzle-dazzle technique and unusual look\" and said that \"the camera loops and zooms in a dizzying fashion that fairly takes one's breath away.\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times compared the animation to Disney's Who Framed Roger Rabbit, saying that \"both movies take apart the universe of cinematic visuals and put it back together again, allowing us to see in a new way.\" Due to the film's creative animation, Richard Corliss of TIME claimed that it was \"the year's most inventive comedy\". The voice cast was also praised by various critics. Susan Wloszczyna of USA Today approved of the selection of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen for the lead roles. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times stated that \"Starting with Tom Hanks, who brings an invaluable heft and believability to Woody, Toy Story is one of the best voiced animated features in memory, with all the actors ... making their presences strongly felt.\" Several critics also recognized the film's ability to appeal to various age groups. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote \"It has the purity, the ecstatic freedom of imagination, that's the hallmark of the greatest children's films. It also has the kind of spring-loaded allusive prankishness that, at times, will tickle adults even more than it does kids.\" In 1995, Toy Story was ranked eighth in TIMEs list of the \"Best 10 films of 1995\".

In more recent years, director Terry Gilliam has praised the film as \"a work of genius. It got people to understand what toys are about. They're true to their own character. And that's just brilliant. It's got a shot that's always stuck with me when Buzz Lightyear discovers he's a toy. He's sitting on this landing at the top of the staircase and the camera pulls back and he's this tiny little figure. He was this guy with a massive ego two seconds before... and it's stunning. I'd put that as one of my top ten films, period.\""

When General Fitts visits the post with his daughter Kit on their way to Manila, Dick is assigned to drive her to a reception that evening. Falling victim to the moonlit night, Kit and Dick attend a luau instead, and he sings Aloha \u2018Oe. They are discovered in each other's arms by Scrapper and Lieutenant Biddle, who is also in love with Kit. Biddle accuses Dick of ruining Kit's reputation and forcing her to accompany him off post. Dick decides to desert. Scrapper begs Kit to straighten things out with Biddle. To prevent Dick from deserting, Kit tells him that she was responding to a crazy impulse and he means nothing to her. Stung by her words, and Biddle's condescending statement that \"if you were an officer and a gentleman, you'd understand,\" Dick decides to compete with Biddle as an equal and applies for West Point. He is accepted and does very well, to Scrapper's delight. In his First Class year, Dick becomes First Captain and General Fitts is appointed Academy superintendent, with Biddle present as his aide. While most of his classmates are infatuated with Kit, Dick is cold to her. Consequently, he is not very happy when the rest of the men insist that she participate in the traditional \"Hundredth Night\" theatrical performance that he is to direct. Dick writes a comedy about a female general with a message directed at Kit. After the first rehearsal, Kit walks with Dick on Flirtation Walk and tries to explain why she told him she was not in love with him. Dick is too angry to listen to Kit, but during their on-stage love scene kisses her, and she admits she loves him. When, near graduation, General Fitts announces Kit's engagement to Biddle, Dick naturally is confused, and visits her after lights out to talk her out of marrying Biddle. He is caught by Biddle and, at Biddle's suggestion, agrees to resign from the Academy to protect Kit's name. Scrapper arrives at the Academy to see Dick graduate and is disappointed to learn of his resignation. The day is saved when Biddle tells Dick that his resignation was not accepted and that Kit returned his ring, wishing him good luck. Dick graduates a happy man."

        "content": "In Paris in 1860, a distraught man murders his wife's doctor.  Chemist Louis Pasteur (Paul Muni) has been publicizing a theory that diseases are caused by microbes, which doctors should avoid spreading by washing their hands and sterilizing their instruments in boiling water.  The doctor did not do this and the wife died of puerperal fever after giving birth. Pasteur is dismissed by France's medical academy\u2014particularly his most vocal critic, Dr. Charbonnet (Fritz Leiber Sr.)\u2014as a crank whose recommendations are tantamount to witchcraft. Pasteur frankly calls attention to the risks of Charbonnet's non-sterile methods and correctly predicts that a member of Napoleon III's royal family who Charbonnet is attending will die of puerperal fever, but Pasteur is the one who is considered dangerous, because his ideas have led to murder. When the Emperor comes down against him, Pasteur leaves Paris and moves to the small town of Arbois. In the 1870s, when the new French government tries to restore the economy after the Franco-Prussian War, they learn that many sheep are dying of anthrax, except around Arbois. They send representatives who learn that, working with a small group of loyal researchers, Pasteur has developed a vaccine against the disease and put it into use locally. The medical academy still opposes him and says Arbois must simply be free of anthrax, so the government buys land there and invites sheep farmers to use it. Pasteur objects strongly, saying the soil is full of anthrax spores, and eventually an experiment is proposed. He will vaccinate 25 of the newly arrived sheep; then they and a control group of 25 others will be injected with blood from a sheep with anthrax. Joseph Lister (Halliwell Hobbes), the pioneer of antiseptic surgery in England, is interested enough to attend, and witnesses Pasteur's total success as all the vaccinated sheep remain healthy after the other 25 have died.  At this point Jean Martel (Donald Woods), a young doctor who was formerly Charbonnet's assistant but now is a follower of Pasteur, becomes engaged to Pasteur's daughter Annette (Anita Louise). The celebrations are short-lived, as a rabid dog runs through the town and a man is bitten. As a woman attempts to cure him by witchcraft, Pasteur laments that doctors would have no more chance of success.  Moving back to Paris, he makes rabies his next project. He is able to spread the disease from one animal to another by injection, but finds himself unable to detect any microbe being transferred (viruses had not yet been discovered), and the method he used to create the anthrax vaccine does not work. Charbonnet visits the lab to gloat over Pasteur's failure. He is so certain Pasteur is a quack that he injects himself with rabies\u2014and is triumphant, as he does not get the disease. Pasteur is puzzled, until his wife Marie (Josephine Hutchinson) suggests that the sample may have gotten weak with age. This sets him on the right path at last, giving dogs a series of progressively stronger injections. But before his experiments reach a conclusion, a frantic mother begs him to try his untested treatment on her son (Dickie Moore), who has been bitten by a rabid dog. Risking imprisonment or even execution, Pasteur decides he must try to save the child. During the attempt, a Dr. Zaranoff (Akim Tamiroff) arrives from Russia with a group of peasants who have been exposed to rabies, and who have volunteered to receive Pasteur's treatment. Annette goes into labor with Martel's child. The doctor who was to attend her is unavailable, and Martel is urgently needed for the boy. Pasteur searches frantically for another doctor, but the only one he can find is none other than Charbonnet. He begs Charbonnet to wash his hands and sterilize his instruments just this once; Charbonnet finally agrees on condition that if Charbonnet lives another month, Pasteur will retract and denounce all his work on rabies. Both men are honorable enough to respect the agreement. The birth goes well, but Pasteur collapses with a mild stroke. Days later, word comes that Pasteur has permission to treat those of the Russians who are still alive. He attends them in hospital for the first injections using a wheelchair, and later using a cane. The experiment is a success, and now even Charbonnet concedes that he was wrong, tearing up Pasteur's retraction and asking for the shots for himself. Afterwards, Pasteur hears that he is to be denounced by Lister at the medical academy. He angrily attends, but it was just a way to surprise him. He is praised by Lister, presented with a Russian medal by Zaranoff, and honored by the very doctors who once scoffed at his discoveries."

        "content": "Stage Door is a 1937 RKO film directed by Gregory La Cava. Adapted from the play of the same name, it tells the story of several would-be actresses who live together in a boarding house at 158 West 58th Street in New York City. The film stars Katharine Hepburn, Ginger Rogers, Adolphe Menjou, Gail Patrick, Constance Collier, Andrea Leeds, Samuel S. Hinds and Lucille Ball. Eve Arden and Ann Miller, who became notable in later films, play minor characters. The film was adapted by Morrie Ryskind and Anthony Veiller from the play by Edna Ferber and George S. Kaufman, but the play's storyline and the characters' names were almost completely changed for the movie, so much so in fact that Kaufman joked the film should be called \"Screen Door\"."

        "content": "Terry Randall (Katharine Hepburn) moves into the Footlights Club, a theatrical boarding house in New York. Her polished manners and superior attitude make her no friends among the rest of the aspiring actresses living there, particularly her new roommate, flippant, cynical dancer Jean Maitland (Ginger Rogers). From Terry's expensive clothing and her photograph of her elderly grandfather, Jean assumes she has obtained the former from her sugar daddy, just as fellow resident Linda Shaw (Gail Patrick) has from her relationship with influential theatrical producer Anthony Powell (Adolphe Menjou). In truth, Terry comes from a wealthy Midwest family. Over the strong objections of her father, Henry Sims (Samuel S. Hinds), she is determined to try to fulfill her dreams. In the boarding house, Terry's only supporter is aging actress Anne Luther (Constance Collier), who appoints herself Terry's mentor and acting coach. When Powell sees Jean dancing, he decides to dump Linda. He arranges for Jean and her partner Annie (Ann Miller) to get hired for the floor show of a nightclub he partly owns. He then starts dating Jean, who starts falling for him. Meanwhile, well-liked Kay Hamilton (Andrea Leeds) had a great success and rave reviews in a play the year before but has had no work since and is running out of money. She clings desperately to the hope of landing the leading role in Powell's new play, Enchanted April. She finally gets an appointment to see Powell, only to have him cancel. She faints in the reception area, the result of malnutrition and disappointment. Seeing this, Terry barges into Powell's private office and berates him for his callousness.  As a result, the other boarding house residents start to warm to the newcomer. Terry's father secretly finances Enchanted April on condition that Terry be given the starring role, hoping she will fail and return home. Powell invites Terry to his penthouse to break the news. When Jean shows up unannounced, Terry sees the opportunity to save her friend from the philandering Powell. She pretends that Powell is trying to seduce her. It works. However, it makes things uncomfortable around the boarding house. Terry's landing of the plum part breaks Kay's heart. The inexperienced Terry is so woodenly bad during rehearsals that Powell tries to get out of his contract with Sims. On opening night, after she learns from Jean that Kay has died by suicide, Terry decides she cannot go on. Anne Luther tells her that she must, not just for herself and the tradition of the theatre, but also for Kay. She does and gives a heartfelt performance. She and the play are a hit, much to the chagrin of her father, who is in the audience. At her curtain call, Terry gives a speech in tribute to her dead friend, and Terry and Jean are reconciled. The play remains a success after months, but Terry continues to board at the Footlights Club. A newcomer shows up looking for a room."

Such a strange flower, suitable to any occasion. I carried them on my wedding day and now I place them here in memory of something that has died,\" are from The Lake (1934), the play for which Dorothy Parker panned Hepburn's performance as \"running the gamut of emotions from A to B.\" The movie has almost nothing to do with the play, except in a few character names, such as Kay Hamilton, Jean Maitland, Terry Randall, Linda Shaw, and Judith Canfield. In the play, Terry Randall is from a rural family whose father is a country doctor, and Jean Maitland is actually a shallow girl who becomes a movie star. Kay Hamilton does commit suicide, but for completely different reasons and not on an opening night."

Ninotchka is Greta Garbo's first full comedy, and her penultimate film; she received her third and final Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.

        "content": "Three Soviet agents, Iranoff (Sig Ruman), Buljanoff (Felix Bressart), and Kopalski (Alexander Granach), arrive in Paris to sell jewellery confiscated from the aristocracy during the Russian Revolution of 1917. Count Alexis Rakonin (Gregory Gaye), a White Russian  nobleman reduced to employment as a waiter in the hotel where the trio are staying, overhears details of their mission and informs the former Russian Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire) that her court jewels are to be sold by the three men. Her debonair paramour, Count Leon d'Algout (Melvyn Douglas) offers to help retrieve her jewellery before it is sold. In their hotel suite, Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski negotiate with Mercier (Edwin Maxwell) a prominent Parisian jeweller, when Leon interrupts the meeting. He explains that the jewels are stolen and a petition has been filed preventing their sale or removal. Mercier withdraws his offer to purchase the jewellery until the lawsuit is settled. The amiable, charming and cunning Leon treats the three Russians to an extravagant lunch, gets them drunk and easily wins their confidence and friendship. He sends a telegram to Moscow in their name suggesting a compromise. Moscow, angered by the telegram, then sends Nina Ivanovna \"Ninotchka\" Yakushova (Greta Garbo), a special envoy whose goal is to win the lawsuit, complete the jewellery sale and return with the three renegade Russians. Ninotchka is methodical, rigid and stern, chastising Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski for failing to complete their mission. Ninotchka and Leon first meet outside the hotel, their respective identities unknown to one another. He flirts, but she is uninterested. Intrigued, Leon follows her to the Eiffel Tower and shows her his home through a telescope. Intrigued by his behavior, Ninotchka tells him he might warrant study and suggests they go to his apartment. Ninotchka becomes attracted to Leon and eventually, they kiss, but they are interrupted by a phone call from Buljanoff. Ninotchka and Leon both realize they are each other's adversaries over the jewellery and she leaves the apartment, despite Leon's protestations. While attending to the various legal matters over the lawsuit, Ninotchka gradually becomes seduced by the west and by the persistent Leon, who has fallen in love with her and broken down her resistance. At a dinner date with Leon where she unexpectedly meets Swana face-to-face (her rival for the jewellery and for Leon's affections), Ninotchka consumes champagne for the first time and quickly becomes intoxicated. The following afternoon, a hungover Ninotchka is awakend by Swana and discovers Rakonin has stolen the jewellery during the night. Swana tells Ninotchka that she will return the jewels and drop the litigation if Ninotchka leaves Paris for Russia immediately so that Swana can have Leon to herself. Ninotchka reluctantly agrees and completes the sale of the jewellery to Mercier. Later that evening, Ninotchka, Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski fly back to Moscow. Meanwhile, Leon visits Swana and confesses his love for Ninotchka. Swana then informs Leon that Ninotchka has already left for Moscow. He attempts to follow her but is denied a Russian visa, because of his nobility. Sometime later, in Moscow, Ninotchka invites her three comrades to her shared apartment for dinner and they nostalgically recall their time in Paris. Ninotchka finally receives a letter from Leon, but it has been completely censored by the authorities, and she is devastated. More time passes; Iranoff, Buljanoff and Kopalski once again run afoul of their superiors after they fail at their mission to sell furs in Constantinople. Against her wishes, Ninotchka is sent by Commissar Razinin (Bela Lugosi) to once again retrieve the trio. After Ninotchka arrives in Constantinople, the three Russians inform her that they have opened a restaurant and will not be returning to Moscow. When Ninotchka asks them who was responsible for this idea, they point to a balcony where Leon is standing. He explains that he was barred from entering Russia to win Ninotchka back, so he and the three Russians conspired to get her to leave the country. He  asks her to stay with him and she happily agrees. The final shot in the film is of Kopalski carrying a protest sign complaining that Iranoff and Buljanoff are unfair, because his name does not illuminate on the electric sign in front of their new restaurant."

Written by Cole Porter, the stage production was based on Ninotchka's story and script and starred Hildegard Neff and Don Ameche. MGM then produced a 1957 film version of the musical  directed by Rouben Mamoulian and starring Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse. Actor George Tobias, who portrayed Commissar Markovitch in Silk Stockings, also appeared in Ninotchka in an uncredited small role as the Russian official who gets punched by Leon for refusing him a visa. The MGM films Comrade X (1940), starring Clark Gable and Hedy Lamarr, and The Iron Petticoat (1956), starring Bob Hope and Katharine Hepburn, both borrow heavily from Ninotchka. MGM had scheduled Madame Curie as Garbo's next film, but pleased with the success of Ninotchka, the studio quickly decided to team Garbo and Douglas in another romantic comedy. Two-Faced Woman (1941) was the result and Garbo received the worst reviews of her entire career. It turned out to be her final film and Greer Garson eventually starred in Madame Curie. In 1990, Ninotchka was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In 2011, Time also included the film on the magazine's list of \"All-Time 100 Movies\".

        "content": "During the Great Depression, Godfrey \"Smith\" Parke is unemployed, living with other homeless men down on their luck at a New York City dump in a Hooverville on the East River near the 59th Street Bridge. One night, a spoiled socialite named Cornelia Bullock offers him $5 to be her \"forgotten man\" for a scavenger hunt. The annoyed Godfrey refuses, causing Cornelia to retreat and fall on a pile of ashes, much to the glee of her younger sister and rival Irene. After talking with Irene, Godfrey finds her to be kind and offers to go with her to help her beat Cornelia, as well as satisfy his own curiosity regarding their scavenger hunt. In the ballroom of the Waldorf-Ritz Hotel, Irene's businessman father Alexander Bullock waits resignedly as his wife Angelica and her mooching prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Carlo play the game. Godfrey arrives and is authenticated as a \"forgotten man\", allowing Irene to win the game. However, Godfrey takes the opportunity to address his contempt for the audience's antics before leaving in a huff. Realizing what she brought him into, an apologetic Irene offers Godfrey to be her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 by hiring him as the new family butler, which he gratefully accepts. On his first day as the new butler, Godfrey is warned by the Bullocks' maid Molly that he is merely the latest in a long line of butlers who didn't last long due to the Bullocks' conflicting personalities and antics. Despite this, Godfrey proves to be surprisingly competent and resourceful in his duties, but Cornelia holds a grudge against him, intending to get him in trouble and have him dumped back into the streets. In the meantime, Irene proves herself to be far kinder and more empathetic than her family, particularly her sister, but just as spoiled and altogether na\u00efve, becoming infatuated with Godfrey through no more than basic interaction and general allure. She even goes as far as to kiss him, causing a job-anxious Godfrey to politely but firmly outline the boundaries of their employee-employer relationship. Eventually, Godfrey is recognized by his longtime friend Tommy Gray at a tea party thrown by Irene. Godfrey makes up a story that he was Tommy's valet at Harvard, to which Tommy plays along by embellishing Godfrey's story with a nonexistent wife and five children. Upon hearing this, a dismayed Irene impulsively announces her engagement to the surprised Charlie Van Rumple but breaks down in tears and flees after being congratulated by Godfrey. Over lunch the next day, Tommy is curious to know what one of the elite \"Parkes of Boston\" is doing as a servant. Godfrey explains that a broken love affair left him broke and considering suicide, but the undaunted attitude of the homeless men living at the dump rekindled his spirits. Eventually, Irene breaks her engagement with Charlie. Cornelia attempts to seduce Godfrey on his day off, but when he rebuffs her, she plants her pearl necklace under Godfrey's mattress and calls the police, intending to have him arrested. However, the police couldn't find the pearls inside the mattress, and Mr. Bullock (having deduced what Cornelia did) furiously informed Cornelia that the pearls are not insured and that she will lose a great deal of money if she doesn't find the necklace, distressing her. The Bullocks send their daughters to Europe to get Irene away from her now-broken engagement, but when they return, Cornelia implies that she intends to seduce Godfrey again. A worried Irene stages a fainting spell and swoons into Godfrey's arms, but he rebuffs her after realizing that she's faking. Having enough of Irene's behavior, Godfrey announces his resignation as the butler. Before Godfrey is about to leave, Mr. Bullock throws Carlo out (literally), and announces to the family that their business is failing and that he tried to recoup the losses with his stockholders' money behind their backs, which will land him in prison on embezzlement charges and leave the rest of the family penniless. However, Godfrey provides good news: he had sold short, using some of the money raised by pawning Cornelia's pearl necklace to buy up the stock that Bullock had sold. He gives the stock back to Mr. Bullock, saving the family from financial ruin. Godfrey also returns the necklace to Cornelia, who concedes defeat by confessing to planting the necklace in the mattress and humbly expressing her gratitude and remorse for her behavior. As Godfrey leaves, the grateful Molly and the Bullocks are saddened to see him go, but Irene is determined to follow him. With Godfrey's remaining profits, Godfrey and Tommy become business partners as they convert the now-filled-in dump into a fashionable nightclub called \"The Dump\", creating new jobs for the other homeless men, with a housing plan for new SRO apartments for them. Upon hearing of Godfrey's new occupation during The Dump's grand opening, a determined Irene finds Godfrey and convinces him to marry her by persuading the Mayor (who is the guest of honor) to perform a civil wedding while her chauffeur serves as a witness."

The film was one of the first under the new regime of Charles Rogers at Universal, although it had been developed under his predecessor Carl Laemmle Jr. La Cava, a former animator, and freelancer for most of his film career held studio executives in contempt and was known to be a bit eccentric. When he and Powell hit a snag over a disagreement about how Godfrey should be portrayed, they settled things over a bottle of Scotch. The next morning, La Cava showed up for shooting with a headache, but Powell didn't appear. Instead, the actor sent a telegram stating: \"WE MAY HAVE FOUND GODFREY LAST NIGHT BUT WE LOST POWELL. SEE YOU TOMORROW.\" Due to insurance considerations a stand-in stuntman (Chick Collins) was used when Godfrey carried Irene over his shoulder up the stairs to her bedroom. When tensions hit a high point on the set, Lombard had a habit of inserting four-letter words into her dialogue, often to the great amusement of the cast. This made shooting somewhat difficult, but clips of her cursing in her dialogue and messing up her lines can still be seen in blooper reels."

Particularly praising the scene of the scavenging party, Greene finds it to be \"perhaps the wittiest, as well as noisiest, sequence of the year\".

It stars Audrey Hepburn as a princess out to see Rome on her own and Gregory Peck as a reporter. Hepburn won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance; the screenplay and costume design also won. The script was written by John Dighton and Dalton Trumbo, though with Trumbo on the Hollywood blacklist, he did not receive a credit; instead, Ian McLellan Hunter fronted for him. Trumbo's credit was reinstated when the film was released on DVD in 2003. On December 19, 2011, full credit for Trumbo's work was restored. Blacklisted director Bernard Vorhaus worked on the film as an assistant director under a pseudonym. The film was shot at the Cinecitt\u00e0 studios and on location around Rome during the \"Hollywood on the Tiber\" era. The film was screened in the 14th Venice Film Festival within the official program. In 1999, Roman Holiday was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\"."

        "content": "Ann, a crown princess from an unnamed European nation on a state visit to Rome, becomes frustrated with her tightly scheduled life and secretly leaves her country's embassy. The delayed effect of a sedative makes her fall asleep on a bench, where Joe Bradley, an expatriate reporter for the \"American News Service\", finds her, without recognizing who she is. Thinking that she is intoxicated, Joe lets her spend the night in his apartment. The next morning, Joe hurries off late to work and gives his editor, Mr. Hennessy, false details of his attendance at the princess's press conference. When Hennessy informs him that the event had been cancelled and shows him a news item about the princess's \"sudden illness\" with a picture of her in it, he realizes who is asleep in his apartment. Seeing an opportunity, Joe privately calls his photographer friend, Irving Radovich, to get him to secretly take pictures. Joe then tells Hennessy that he will get an exclusive wide-ranging interview with the princess and asks how much that would be worth. Hennessy offers to pay $5000, but bets Joe $500 that he will not be able to get it. Joe hurries home and, hiding the fact that he is a reporter, offers to show \"Anya\" around Rome. However, Ann declines Joe's offer and leaves. Enjoying her freedom, she explores an outdoor market, buys a pair of shoes, observes the people and daily life of Rome, and gets her long hair cut short. Joe follows and \"accidentally\" meets Ann on the Spanish Steps. This time, he convinces her to spend the day with him, taking her to a street caf\u00e9 where he meets up with Irving. When Anya tries to drive Joe on a Vespa through heavy Roman traffic they are all arrested, but Joe and Irving show their \"fake\" press passes and the group is set free. They visit the Mouth of Truth, where Joe tricks Ann into thinking that his hand has been bitten off, and later tour the Colosseum. That night, at a dance on a boat that her barber had invited her to, government agents called in by the embassy spot Ann and try to forcibly take her away. Joe, Irving, and the barber rush in to save her from the abductors. Ann joins in the fight that breaks out. As police arrive and subdue the agents, Joe and Ann run away, but after Joe is ambushed and falls into the river, Ann jumps in to save him. They swim away from the dance and kiss as they sit shivering on the riverbank. Later at Joe's apartment, while drying their wet clothes, they share tender bittersweet moments. Regretfully bowing to her royal responsibilities, Ann asks Joe to drive her to a corner near the embassy, where they kiss again. She bids a tearful farewell and resumes her duties as a princess. Joe decides not to write the story, although he tells Irving he is free to sell his photographs. Joe and Irving then leave to attend the postponed press conference at the embassy, much to Princess Ann's surprise. Joe assures Ann (in words she, but not the other reporters, will understand) that he will print nothing about their day together. At the end of the interview, the princess unexpectedly asks to meet the journalists, speaking briefly with each. As she reaches Joe and Irving, Irving presents her with his photographs as a memento of Rome. She and Joe share a few innocuous words together, before she reluctantly departs. After the rest of the press leave, Joe stays for awhile, then walks away alone."

        "content": "Wyler first offered the role to Hollywood favorite Cary Grant. Grant declined, believing he was too old to play Hepburn's love interest, though he played opposite her ten years later in Charade. Other sources say Grant declined because he knew all of the attention would be centered around the princess. Peck's contract gave him solo star billing, with newcomer Hepburn listed much less prominently in the credits. Halfway through the filming, Peck suggested to Wyler that he elevate her to equal billing\u2014an almost unheard-of gesture in Hollywood. Wyler had initially considered Elizabeth Taylor and Jean Simmons for the princess' role, but both were unavailable. On 18 September 1951, director Thorold Dickinson made a screen test with Hepburn and sent it to director William Wyler, who was in Rome preparing Roman Holiday. Wyler wrote to Dickinson, saying that \"as a result of the test, a number of the producers at Paramount have expressed interest in casting her.\" Roman Holiday was not Hepburn's first acting role, as she had appeared in Dutch and British films from 1948 and on stage, but it was her first major film role and her first appearance in an American film. Wyler wanted an \"anti-Italian\" actress who was different from the curvy Italian stars of that era: \"She was perfect ... his new star had no arse, no tits, no tight-fitting clothes, no high heels. In short a Martian. She will be a sensation.\""

The film also opened the same week in two theatres in Portland, Oregon on a double bill with Murder Without Tears, grossing $14,000. Milton Luban of the Hollywood Reporter said the movie \"proves a charming, laugh-provoking affair that often explodes into hilarity....it has a \"delightful screenplay that sparkles with wit and outrageous humor that at times comes close to slapstick\" and that the \"cinematographers do a fine job of incorporating Roman landmarks into the storyline.\" The New York Times observed that it was \"a natural, tender and amusing yarn\" with \"laughs that leave the spirits soaring.\" Roman Holiday was the second most popular film at the US box office during September 1953 behind From Here to Eternity, grossing almost $1 million. It earned an estimated $3 million at the United States and Canadian box office during its first few months of release. While the domestic box office disappointed Paramount, it was very successful elsewhere, including the UK, where the film benefited from both the concurrent romance between Princess Margaret and commoner Peter Townsend\u2014\"No film studio could have bought such publicity\", Alexander Walker wrote\u2014and a fad for Italian culture. Due to the film's popularity, both Peck and Hepburn were approached about filming a sequel, but this project never got off the ground. The film has been very well received, with a 97% \"Certified fresh\" rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 58 reviews with an average rating of 8.41/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"With Audrey Hepburn luminous in her American debut, Roman Holiday is as funny as it is beautiful, and sets the standard for the modern romantic comedy.\""

An unofficial Tamil-language adaptation, titled May Madham, was released in 1994. The 1991 Malayalam movie Kilukkam was also reported to be based on this movie. The Richard Curtis film Notting Hill has been likened to \"a 90's London-set version of Roman Holiday\". There are a number of allusions to it in the film, in which the princess character is replaced with \"Hollywood royalty\" and the commoner is a British bookshop owner. Paramount Pictures has since licensed three adaptations of Roman Holiday into musicals: In 2012, a musical stage version, following the plot while using the songs of Cole Porter, was presented in Minneapolis. The book adaptation was done by Paul Blake (Beautiful: The Carole King Story). It was scheduled for a run in San Francisco in summer 2017 before going on to Broadway. Another version was staged in 2004 in Rome under the title Vacanze Romane using the Cole Porter score, supplemented with music by Italian film composer Armando Trovajoli. This production is performed annually at the Teatro Sistina in Rome and on tour in Italy and Spain. A version entirely in Japanese with a completely different score was produced in 1998 by Toho [Japanese Theatre Company]."

        "content": "The Pride of the Yankees is a 1942 American film produced by Samuel Goldwyn, directed by Sam Wood, and starring Gary Cooper, Teresa Wright, and Walter Brennan. It is a tribute to the legendary New York Yankees first baseman Lou Gehrig, who died only one year before its release, at age 37, from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which later became known to the lay public as \"Lou Gehrig's disease\". Though subtitled The Life of Lou Gehrig, the film is less a sports biography than an homage to a heroic and widely loved sports figure whose tragic and premature death touched the entire nation. It emphasizes Gehrig's relationship with his parents (particularly his strong-willed mother), his friendships with players and journalists, and his storybook romance with the woman who became his \"companion for life,\" Eleanor Twitchell. Details of his baseball career\u2014which were still fresh in most fans' minds in 1942\u2014are limited to montages of ballparks, pennants, and Cooper swinging bats and running bases, though Gehrig's best-known major league record\u20142,130 consecutive games played\u2014is prominently cited. Yankee teammates Babe Ruth, Bob Meusel, Mark Koenig, and Bill Dickey play themselves, as does sportscaster Bill Stern. The film was adapted by Herman J. Mankiewicz, Jo Swerling, and an uncredited Casey Robinson from a story by Paul Gallico, and received 11 Oscar nominations. It ends with a re-enactment of Gehrig's poignant 1939 farewell speech at Yankee Stadium. The film's iconic closing line\u2014\"Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth\"\u2014was voted 38th on the American Film Institute's list of 100 greatest movie quotes."

        "content": "Lou Gehrig is a young Columbia University student whose old-fashioned mother wants him to study hard and become an engineer, but the young man has a gift for baseball. A sportswriter befriends Gehrig and persuades a scout to come see him play. When his mother gets sick, Gehrig signs with the team he has always revered, the New York Yankees to pay for the hospital bills. With the help of his father, he endeavors to keep his career change a secret from his mother. Gehrig works his way up through the minor leagues and joins the Yankees. His hero, Babe Ruth, is at first condescending and dismissive of the rookie, but his strong, consistent play wins over Ruth and the rest of the team. Gehrig is unknowingly included by his teammates in playing pranks on Ruth on the team train. During a game at Comiskey Park, Gehrig trips over a stack of bats and is teased by a spectator, Eleanor(the daughter of the ballpark hot dog magnate) , who laughingly calls him \"tanglefoot\". Later, they are properly introduced, leading to a relationship, and then an engagement. Gehrig's mother, who still has not accepted the fact that her son will not be an engineer, does not take this news well; Gehrig finally stands up to her, and marries Eleanor. The Yankees become the most dominant team in baseball, and Gehrig becomes a fan favorite. His father and fully converted mother attend games and cheer for him. In a re-creation of a famous (and possibly apocryphal) story, Gehrig visits a crippled boy named Billy in a hospital. He promises to hit two home runs in a single World Series game in the boy's honor\u2014then fulfills his promise. Gehrig is now the \"Iron Horse\", a national hero at the peak of his career with multitudes of fans, many loyal friends, and an adoring wife. Then he begins to notice, with growing alarm, that his strength is slowly ebbing away. Though he continues to play, and extends his consecutive-game streak to a seemingly insurmountable record, his physical condition continues its inexorable decline. One day, in Detroit, he tells Yankees manager Joe McCarthy that he has become a detriment to the team and benches himself. After an examination, a doctor gives him the awful news: Gehrig has a rare, incurable disease, and only a short time to live. A short time later, at Lou Gehrig Day at Yankee Stadium, an older Billy finds Gehrig and shows him that he has made a full recovery, inspired by his hero's example and the two-homer fulfilled promise. Then, as Eleanor weeps softly in the stands, Gehrig addresses the fans: \"People all say that I've had a bad break. But today ... today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth.\""

        "content": "Samuel Goldwyn displayed little interest in Sam Wood's initial proposal to make a movie tribute to Gehrig, as he had no knowledge or interest in baseball.  In addition, conventional Hollywood wisdom dictated that sports pictures were box-office poison, as women, who made up more than half the audience and made most movie-going decisions, did not like them. After Wood screened newsreel footage of Gehrig's famous \"luckiest man\" speech, however, Goldwyn\u2014with tears in his eyes\u2014agreed to produce the picture. In a 1941 press campaign publicizing plans for the film, RKO Pictures announced a major talent hunt for Gehrig's portrayer, but Goldwyn and Wood reportedly never considered casting anyone but Cooper in the title role. Although he was ideally suited to the part due to his physical resemblance to Gehrig and the quiet strength and masculine appeal that he projected, Cooper was reluctant to accept it because he, like Goldwyn, had no interest in baseball. By one account, he had never watched a game nor even swung a bat prior to taking the role. Another problem was Cooper's age (41), particularly in scenes involving Gehrig as a young man. Cinematographer Rudolph Mat\u00e9 lighted Cooper from below during those early scenes to conceal lines and wrinkles, then gradually reduced and finally eliminated the lighting effect as the story progressed. Another important (and problematic) casting decision was Babe Ruth, as himself. Ruth's health had been declining steadily since his retirement in 1935, and by 1942 he weighed nearly 270 pounds. He was put on a strict diet to achieve a presentable weight before filming began. This rapid weight loss, on the heels of a heart attack followed by a car accident, combined with the tough shooting schedule and Ruth's propensity to keep late hours, weakened him significantly. By the time filming wrapped he had developed pneumonia severe enough to require a period of hospitalization. Multiple published sources have asserted that Cooper, who was right-handed, could not master a convincing left-handed swing. To remedy the problem, the story went, he was filmed wearing a mirror-image uniform and swinging from the right side of the plate, then running to third base instead of first; technicians then purportedly flopped the print of the film. Tom Shieber, Senior Curator at the National Baseball Hall of Fame, has shown, however, that Cooper did indeed learn to bat left-handed, and never wore a backwards Yankees uniform nor ran to third base after swinging. Film footage was, in fact, flopped only once, during a brief sequence portraying Gehrig's minor league days at Hartford, in order to make Cooper appear to be throwing left-handed \u2014 a far more difficult task for a right-hander to master. (\"[Cooper] threw the ball like an old woman tossing a hot biscuit,\" said Lefty O'Doul, who tried unsuccessfully to teach him a convincing left-handed throw.) Scenes requiring Cooper to throw a ball as a Yankee were filmed using his stand-in, the left-handed Babe Herman. Scenes purporting to depict Yankee Stadium, Comiskey Park, and other ballparks were all filmed at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles, home of the Los Angeles Angels of the old Pacific Coast League, and a popular venue for baseball movies of the era, as well as the Home Run Derby television series."

That building is actually located on the north end of campus, well away from the baseball field; his farthest hits most likely smashed through the windows of a nearby building housing the School of Journalism. In the film, Gehrig hits two home runs in a World Series game against the St. Louis Cardinals where Babe Ruth also homers. This never occurred against the Cardinals, but did happen in Game 3 of the 1932 World Series versus the Cubs. In the film, Gehrig meets Eleanor Twitchell early in his career and marries her shortly after his first World Series.  Actually the two met in 1931, well after Gehrig was an established star. They were married in 1933. In one of the film's more memorable scenes, a physician matter-of-factly informs Gehrig of his tragic diagnosis, dismal prognosis, and brief life expectancy. In fact, Mayo Clinic doctors painted an unrealistically optimistic picture of Gehrig's condition and prospects, reportedly at his wife's request. Among other things he was given \"a 50\u201350 chance of keeping me as I am\" for the foreseeable future, and was told that he \"...may need a cane in 10 or 15 years.\" Deliberate concealment of bad news from patients, particularly when cancer or an incurable degenerative disease was involved, was a relatively common practice at the time."

Sister Benedict contracts tuberculosis and the physician recommends to Father O'Malley that she be transferred to a dry climate with non-parochial duties, but without telling her the reason.

Crosby delights one with his ease and natural charm, and Miss Bergman will undoubtedly rise to new heights of popularity because of the effective way in which she portrays her role.\" John McCarten of The New Yorker wrote derisively: \"Mr. McCarey seems to view the Roman Catholic Church, which is quite a formidable and venerable organization, as a kind of settlement house where good works and jollity provide a lively substitute for religion ... Everything, of course, turns out quite happily, except, perhaps, for those captious souls who regard religion as an adult matter.\" The Bells of St. Mary's placed fourth on Film Dailys year-end nationwide poll of 559 critics naming the best films of 1946."

        "content": "Wag the Dog is a 1997 American political satire black comedy film produced and directed by Barry Levinson and starring Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro. The film centers on a spin doctor and a Hollywood producer who fabricate a war in Albania to distract voters from a presidential sex scandal. The screenplay by Hilary Henkin and David Mamet was loosely adapted from Larry Beinhart's 1993 novel, American Hero. Wag the Dog was released one month before the outbreak of the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal and the subsequent bombing of the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan by the Clinton administration in August 1998, which prompted the media to draw comparisons between the film and reality. The comparison was also made in December 1998 when the administration initiated a bombing campaign of Iraq during Clinton's impeachment trial over the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal. It was made again in the spring of 1999 when the administration intervened in the Kosovo War and initiated a bombing campaign against  Yugoslavia, which coincidentally bordered Albania and contained ethnic Albanians. The film grossed $64.3 million on a $15 million budget and was well received by critics, who praised the direction, performances, themes, and humor. Hoffman received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance and screenwriters David Mamet and Hilary Henkin were both nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay."

Conrad Brean, a top spin doctor, is brought in by presidential aide Winifred Ames to take the public's attention away from the scandal. He decides to construct a fictional war in Albania, hoping the media will concentrate on this instead. Brean contacts Hollywood producer Stanley Motss to create the war, complete with a theme song and fake film footage of a sympathy arousing orphan. The hoax is initially successful, with the president quickly gaining ground in the polls. When the CIA learns of the plot, they send Agent Young to confront Brean about the hoax. Brean convinces Young that revealing the deception is against his and the CIA's best interests. But when the CIA \u2014 in collusion with the president's rival candidate \u2014 reports that the war has ended, the media begins to focus back on the president's sexual abuse scandal. To counter this, Motss invents a hero who was left behind enemy lines in Albania. Inspired by the idea that he was \"discarded like an old shoe\", Brean and Motss ask the Pentagon to provide a special forces soldier with a matching name (a sergeant named \"Schumann\" is identified) around whom a POW narrative can be constructed. As part of the hoax, folk singer Johnny Dean (Willie Nelson) records a song called \"Old Shoe\", which is pressed onto a 78 rpm record, prematurely aged so that listeners will think it was recorded years earlier, and sent to the Library of Congress to be \"found\".  Soon, large numbers of old pairs of shoes began appearing on phone and power lines, and a grassroots movement takes hold. When the team goes to retrieve Schumann, they discover he is in fact a criminally insane Army convict. On the way back, their plane crashes en route to Andrews Air Force Base. The team survives and is rescued by a farmer, an illegal alien who is given expedited citizenship for a better story. However, Schumann is killed after he attempts to rape a gas station owner's daughter. Seizing the opportunity, Motss stages an elaborate military funeral for Schumann, claiming that he died from wounds sustained during his rescue. While watching a political talk show, Motss gets frustrated that the media are crediting the president's upsurge in the polls to the bland campaign slogan of \"Don't change horses in mid-stream\" rather than to Motss's hard work. Motss states that he wants credit and will reveal his involvement, despite Brean's offer of an ambassadorship and the dire warning that he is \"playing with his life\". After Motss refuses to change his mind, Brean reluctantly orders his security staff to kill him. A newscast reports that Motss has died of a heart attack at home, the president was successfully re-elected, and an Albanian terrorist organization has claimed responsibility for a recent bombing."

However, the Writers Guild of America intervened on Henkin's behalf to ensure that Henkin received first-position shared screenplay credit, finding that\u2014as the original screenwriter\u2014Henkin had created the screenplay's structure as well as much of the screen story and dialogue. Levinson thereafter threatened to (but did not) quit the Guild, claiming that Mamet had written all of the dialogue as well as creating the characters of Motss and Schumann, and had originated most of the scenes set in Hollywood and all of the scenes set in Nashville. Levinson attributed the numerous similarities between Henkin's original version and the eventual shooting script to Henkin and Mamet working from the same novel, but the WGA disagreed in its credit arbitration ruling."

In a local newspaper, The Daily Republican: \"Calling to mind Lord Dundreary's conundrum, the Baltimore American thinks that for the Cincinnati Convention to control the Democratic party would be the 'tail wagging the dog'.\" The phrase, then and now, indicates a backwards situation in which a small and seemingly unimportant entity (the tail) controls a bigger, more important one (the dog). It was again used in the 1960s. The film became a \"reality\" the year after it was released, due to the Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal. Days after the scandal broke, President Bill Clinton ordered missile strikes against two countries, Afghanistan and Sudan. During his impeachment proceedings, Clinton also bombed Iraq, drawing further \"wag the dog\" accusations and with the scandal still on the public's mind in March 1999, his administration launched a bombing campaign against FR Yugoslavia."

In a move to protect his inheritance, Honorable Charles Greville, Emma's then lover and her mother's employer, sent Emma to Naples under false pretenses to live with his uncle, Sir William Hamilton, where she would study to become a lady. Surprisingly to Greville whose deception Emma would eventually discover, Emma ended up becoming Hamilton's wife in a marriage of convenience. But it is Emma's eventual relationship with Horatio Nelson of the British navy that would cause the largest issue. A move by Lady Hamilton helped Nelson's armada defeat Napoleon's fleet in naval battles, which Nelson would have ultimately lost without Lady Hamilton's help.

        "content": "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari () is a 1920 German silent horror film, directed by Robert Wiene and written by Hans Janowitz and Carl Mayer. Considered the quintessential work of German Expressionist cinema, it tells the story of an insane hypnotist (Werner Krauss) who uses a somnambulist (Conrad Veidt) to commit murders. The film features a dark and twisted visual style, with sharp-pointed forms, oblique and curving lines, structures and landscapes that lean and twist in unusual angles, and shadows and streaks of light painted directly onto the sets. The script was inspired by various experiences from the lives of Janowitz and Mayer, both pacifists who were left distrustful of authority after their experiences with the military during World War I. The film makes use of a frame story, with a prologue and epilogue combined with a twist ending. Janowitz has said this device was forced upon the writers against their will. The film's design was handled by Hermann Warm, Walter Reimann and Walter R\u00f6hrig, who recommended a fantastic, graphic style over a naturalistic one. The film thematizes brutal and irrational authority. Writers and scholars have argued the film reflects a subconscious need in German society for a tyrant, and is an example of Germany's obedience to authority and unwillingness to rebel against deranged authority. Some critics have interpreted Caligari as representing the German war government, with Cesare symbolic of the common man conditioned, like soldiers, to kill.  Other themes of the film include the destabilized contrast between insanity and sanity, the subjective perception of reality, and the duality of human nature. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari was released just as foreign film industries were easing restrictions on the import of German films following World War I, so it was screened internationally. Accounts differ as to its financial and critical success upon release, but modern film critics and historians have largely praised it as a revolutionary film. The film was voted number 12 on the prestigious Brussels 12 list at the 1958 World Expo. Critic Roger Ebert called it arguably \"the first true horror film\", and film reviewer Danny Peary called it cinema's first cult film and a precursor for arthouse films. Considered a classic, it helped draw worldwide attention to the artistic merit of German cinema and had a major influence on American films, particularly in the genres of horror and film noir."

        "content": "As Francis  sits on a bench with an older man who complains that spirits have driven him away from his family and home, a dazed woman named Jane passes them. Francis explains she is his \"fianc\u00e9e\" and that they have suffered a great ordeal. Most of the rest of the film is a flashback of Francis's story, which takes place in Holstenwall, a shadowy village of twisted buildings and spiraling streets. Francis and his friend Alan  who are good-naturedly competing for Jane's affections, plan to visit the town fair. Meanwhile, a mysterious man named Dr. Caligari seeks a permit from the rude town clerk to present a spectacle at the fair, which features a somnambulist named Cesare. The clerk mocks and berates Caligari, but ultimately approves the permit. That night, the clerk is found stabbed to death in his bed. The next morning, Francis and Alan visit Caligari's spectacle, where he opens a coffin-like box to reveal the sleeping Cesare. On Caligari's order, Cesare awakens and answers questions from the audience. Despite Francis's protests, Alan asks, \"How long shall I live?\" To Alan's horror, Cesare answers, \"The time is short. You die at dawn!\" Later that night, a figure breaks into Alan's home and stabs him to death in his bed. A grief-stricken Francis investigates Alan's murder with help from Jane and her father, Dr. Olsen, who obtains police authorization to investigate the somnambulist. That night, the police apprehend a criminal in possession of a knife who is caught attempting to murder an elderly woman. When questioned by Francis and Dr. Olsen, the criminal confesses he tried to kill the elderly woman, but denies any part in the two previous deaths; he was merely taking advantage of the situation to divert blame away from himself. At night, Francis spies on Caligari and observes what appears to be Cesare sleeping in his box. However, the real Cesare sneaks into Jane's home as she sleeps. He raises a knife to stab her, but instead abducts her after a struggle, dragging her through the window onto the street. Chased by an angry mob, Cesare eventually drops Jane and flees; he soon collapses and dies. Francis confirms that the criminal who confessed to the elderly woman's murder is still locked away and could not have been Jane's attacker. Francis and the police investigate Caligari's sideshow and realize that the \"Cesare\" sleeping in the box is only a dummy. Caligari escapes in the confusion. Francis follows and sees Caligari go through the entrance of an insane asylum. Upon further investigation, Francis is shocked to learn that Caligari is the asylum's director. With help from the asylum staff, Francis studies the director's records and diary while the director is sleeping. The writings reveal his obsession with the story of an 18th-century mystic named Caligari, who used a somnambulist named Cesare to commit murders in northern Italian towns. The director, attempting to understand the earlier Caligari, experiments on a somnambulist admitted to the asylum, who becomes his Cesare. The asylum director screams, \"I must become Caligari!\" Francis and the doctors call the police to Caligari's office, where they show him Cesare's corpse. Caligari then attacks one of the staff. He is subdued, restrained in a straitjacket, and becomes an inmate in his own asylum. The narrative returns to the present, where Francis concludes his story. In a twist ending, Francis is depicted as an asylum inmate. Jane and Cesare are patients as well; Jane believes that she is a queen, while Cesare is not a somnambulist but awake, quiet, and not visibly dangerous. The man Francis refers to as \"Dr. Caligari\" is the asylum director. Francis attacks him and is restrained in a straitjacket, then placed in the same cell where Caligari was confined in Francis's story. The asylum director announces that, now that he understands Francis's delusion, he is confident that he can cure him."

        "title": "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari_Writing",
        "content": "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari was written by Hans Janowitz and Carl Mayer, both of whom were pacifists by the time they met following World War I. Janowitz served as an officer during the war, but the experience left him embittered with the military, which affected his writing. Mayer feigned madness to avoid military service during the war, which led him to intense examinations from a military psychiatrist. The experience left him distrustful of authority, and the psychiatrist served as a model for the Caligari character. Janowitz and Mayer were introduced in June 1918 by a mutual friend, actor Ernst Deutsch. Both writers were penniless at the time. Gilda Langer, an actress with whom Mayer was in love, encouraged Janowitz and Mayer to write a film together. She later became the basis for the Jane character. Langer also encouraged Janowitz to visit a fortune teller, who predicted that Janowitz would survive his military service during the war, but Langer would die. This prediction proved true, as Langer died unexpectedly in 1920 at the age of 23, and Janowitz said it inspired the scene in which Cesare predicts Alan's death at the fair. Although neither had any associations with the film industry, Janowitz and Mayer wrote a script over six weeks during the winter of 1918\u201319. In describing their roles, Janowitz called himself \"the father who planted the seed, and Mayer the mother who conceived and ripened it\". The Expressionist filmmaker Paul Wegener was among their influences. The story was partially inspired by a circus sideshow the two visited on Kantstrasse in Berlin, called \"Man or Machine?\", in which a man performed feats of great strength after becoming hypnotized. They first visualized the story of Caligari the night of that show. Several of Janowitz's past experiences influenced his writing, including memories of his hometown of Prague, and, as he put it, a mistrust of \"the authoritative power of an inhuman state gone mad\" due to his military service. Janowitz also believed he had witnessed a murder in 1913 near an amusement park on Hamburg's Reeperbahn, beside the Holstenwall, which served as another inspiration for the script. According to Janowitz, he observed a woman disappear into some bushes, from which a respectable-looking man emerged a few moments later, and the next day Janowitz learned the girl was murdered. Holstenwall later became the name of the town setting in Caligari. Janowitz and Mayer are said to have set out to write a story denouncing arbitrary authority as brutal and insane. Janowitz said it was only years after the film was released that he realized exposing the \"authoritative power of an inhuman state\" was the \"subconscious intention\" of the writers. However, Hermann Warm, who designed the film's sets, said Mayer had no political intentions when he wrote the film. Film historian David Robinson noted Janowitz did not refer to anti-authority intentions in the script until many decades after Caligari was released, and he suggested Janowitz's recollection may have changed in response to later interpretations to the film. The film they wrote was entitled Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari, using the English spelling Cabinet rather than the German Kabinett. The completed script contained 141 scenes. Janowitz has claimed the name Caligari, which was not settled upon until after the script was finished, was inspired by a rare book called Unknown Letters of Stendhal, which featured a letter from the French novelist Stendhal referring to a French officer named Caligari he met at the La Scala theatre in Milan. However, no record of any such letter exists, and film historian John D. Barlow suggested Janowitz may have fabricated the story. The physical appearance of Caligari was inspired by portraits of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. The character's name is spelled Calligaris in the only known surviving script, although in some instances the final s is removed. Other character names are also spelled differently from the final film: Cesare appears as Caesare, Alan is Allan or sometimes Alland and Dr. Olfen is Dr. Olfens. Likewise, unnamed characters in the final film have names in the script, including the town clerk (\"Dr. L\u00fcders\") and the house-breaker (\"Jakob Straat\"). The story of Caligari is told abstractly, like a fairy tale, and includes little description about or attention toward the psychological motivations of the characters, which is more heavily emphasized in the film's visual style. The original script shows few traces of the Expressionist influence prevalent in the film's sets and costumes. Through film director Fritz Lang, Janowitz and Mayer met with Erich Pommer, head of production at the Decla-Bioscop film studio, on 19 April 1919, to discuss selling the script. According to Pommer, he attempted to get rid of them, but they persisted until he agreed to meet with them. Pommer reportedly asked the writers to leave the script with him, but they refused, and instead Mayer read it aloud to him. Pommer and his assistant, Julius Sternheim, were so impressed that he refused to let them leave until a contract was signed, and he purchased the script from them that night. The writers had originally sought no fewer than 10,000 marks, but were given 3,500, with the promise of another 2,000 once the film went into production and 500 if it was sold for foreign release, which the producers considered unlikely. The contract, today preserved at Berlin's Bundesfilmarchiv, gave Pommer the right to make any changes to the script deemed appropriate. Pommer said he was drawn to the script because he believed it could be filmed inexpensively, and it bore similarities to films inspired by the macabre horror shows of the Grand Guignol theatre in Paris, which were popular at the time. Pommer later said: \"They saw in the script an 'experiment'. I saw a relatively cheap film\"."

        "title": "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari_Frame story",
        "content": "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari makes use of a \"Rahmenerz\u00e4hlung\", or frame story; a prologue and epilogue establish the main body of the film as a delusional flashback, a novel technique. Lang has said that, during early discussions about his possible involvement with the film, he suggested the addition of an opening scene with a \"normal\" style, which would lead the public into the rest of the film without confusion. It remains unclear whether Lang suggested the frame story structure or simply gave advice on how to write a frame story that was already agreed and some writers, like David Robinson, have questioned whether Lang's recollection is correct. The director, Robert Wiene, was supportive of the changes. Janowitz has said he and Mayer were not privy to discussions about adding the frame story and strongly opposed its inclusion, believing it had deprived the film of its revolutionary and political significance; he wrote that it was \"an illicit violation, a raping of our work\" that turned the film \"into a clich\u00e9 ... in which the symbolism was to be lost\". Janowitz says the writers sought legal action to stop the change but failed. He also says they did not see the finished film with the frame story until a preview was shown to studio heads, after which the writers \"expressed our dissatisfaction in a storm of thunderous remonstrances\". They had to be persuaded not to publicly protest against the film. In his 1947 book From Caligari to Hitler, Siegfried Kracauer argued, based largely on an unpublished typescript written and provided by Janowitz, that the film originally included no frame story and started with the fair coming to town and ended with Caligari becoming institutionalized. Kracauer argued the frame story glorified authority and was added to turn a \"revolutionary\" film into a \"conformistic\" one. No surviving copies of the script were believed to exist until the early 1950s when actor Werner Krauss revealed he still had his copy. He refused to part with it; only in 1978, two decades after his death, was it purchased by the German film archive Deutsche Kinemathek. It remained unavailable for public consumption until 1995, when a full transcript was published. The script revealed that a frame story was part of the original Caligari screenplay, albeit a different one from that in the film. The original manuscript opens on an elegant terrace of a large villa, where Francis and Jane are hosting a party and the guests insist that Francis tell them a story that happened to him 20 years earlier. The conclusion to the frame story is missing from the script. Critics widely agree that the discovery of the screenplay strongly undermines Kracauer's theory, with some, like the German film historian Stephen Brockmann, even arguing it disproves his claims altogether. Others, like John D. Barlow, argue that it does not settle the issue, as the original screenplay's frame story simply serves to introduce the main plot, rather than subvert it as the final film's version does."

        "title": "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari_Development",
        "content": "Many details about the making of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari are in dispute and will probably remain unsettled due to the large number of people involved in the making of the film, many of whom recalled it differently or dramatized their own contributions to its production. Production of the film was delayed about four or five months after the script was purchased. Pommer originally chose Lang as the director of Caligari, and Lang even went so far as to hold preparatory discussions about the script with Janowitz, but he became unavailable due to his involvement with the filming of The Spiders, so Wiene was selected instead. According to Janowitz, Wiene's father, a successful theatre actor, had \"gone slightly mad when he could no longer appear on the stage\", and Janowitz believed that experience helped Wiene bring an \"intimate understanding\" to the source material of Caligari. Decla producer Rudolf Meinert introduced Hermann Warm to Wiene and provided Warm with the Caligari script, asking him to come up with proposals for the design. Warm believed \"films must be drawings brought to life\", and felt a naturalistic set was wrong for the subject of the film, instead recommending a fantastic, graphic style, in which the images would be visionary, nightmarish and out of the ordinary. Warm brought to the project his two friends, painters and stage designers Walter Reimann and Walter R\u00f6hrig, both of whom were associated with the Berlin art and literary magazine Der Sturm. The trio spent a full day and part of the night reading the script, after which Reimann suggested an Expressionist style, a style often used in his own paintings. They also conceived the idea of painting forms and shadows directly onto the sets to ensure a dark and unreal look. According to Warm, the three approached Wiene with the idea and he immediately agreed, although Wiene has made claims that he conceived the film's Expressionist style. Meinert agreed to the idea after one day's consideration, telling Warm, Reimann and R\u00f6hrig to make the sets as \"crazy\" and \"eccentrically\" as possible. He embraced the idea for commercial, not aesthetic reasons: Expressionism was fashionable at the time, so he concluded even if the film received bad reviews, the artistic style would garner attention and make it profitable. Wiene filmed a test scene to demonstrate Warm, Reimann and R\u00f6hrig's theories, and it so impressed the producers that the artists were given free rein. Pommer later said he was responsible for placing Warm, Reimann and R\u00f6hrig in charge of the sets, but Warm has claimed that, although Pommer was in charge of production at Decla when Caligari was made, he was not actually a producer on the film itself. Instead, he says Meinert was the film's true producer, and that it was he who gave Warm the manuscript. Warm claimed Meinert produced the film \"despite the opposition of a part of the management of Decla\". Meinert said Pommer had \"not sanctioned\" the film's abstract visual style. Nevertheless, Pommer claimed to have supervised Caligari, and that the film's Expressionistic style was chosen in part to differentiate it from competing Hollywood films. The predominant attitude at the time was that artistic achievement led to success in exports to foreign film markets. The dominance of Hollywood at the time, coupled with a period of inflation and currency devaluation, forced German film studios to seek projects that could be made inexpensively, with a combination of realistic and artistic elements so the films would be accessible to American audiences, yet also distinctive from Hollywood films. Pommer has claimed while Mayer and Janowitz expressed a desire for artistic experimentation in the film, his decision to use painted canvases as scenery was primarily a commercial one, as they would be a significant financial saving over building sets. Janowitz claims he attempted to commission the sets from designer and engraver Alfred Kubin, known for his heavy use of light and shadow to create a sense of chaos, but Kubin declined to participate in the project because he was too busy. In a conflicting story, however, Janowitz claimed he requested from Decla \"Kubin paintings\", and that they misread his instructions as \"cubist painters\" and hired Reimann and R\u00f6hrig as a result. David Robinson argues this story was probably an embellishment stemming from Janowitz's disdain for the two artists. Janowitz has claimed that he and Mayer conceived the idea of painting the sets on canvas, and that the shooting script included written directions that the scenery be designed in Kubin's style. However, the later rediscovery of the original screenplay refutes this claim, as it includes no such directions about the sets. This was also disputed in a 1926 article by Barnet Braverman in Billboard magazine, which claimed the script included no mention of an unconventional visual style, and that Janowitz and Mayer in fact strongly opposed the stylization. She claims Mayer later came to appreciate the visual style, but that Janowitz remained opposed to it years after the film's release. The set design, costumes and props took about two weeks to prepare. Warm worked primarily on the sets, while R\u00f6hrig handled the painting and Reimann was responsible for the costumes. Robinson noted the costumes in Caligari seem to resemble a wide variety of time periods. For example, Caligari and the fairground workers' costumes resemble the Biedermeier era, while Jane's embody Romanticism. Additionally, Robinson wrote, Cesare's costume and those of policemen in the film appear abstract, while many of the other characters' seem like ordinary German clothes from the 1920s. The collaborative nature of the film's production highlights the importance that both screenwriters and set designers held in German cinema of the 1920s, although film critic Lotte H. Eisner said sets held more importance than anything else in German films at that time. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari was the first German Expressionist film, although Brockmann and film critic Mike Budd claim it was also influenced by German Romanticism; Budd notes the film's themes of insanity and the outcry against authority are common among German Romanticism in literature, theatre and the visual arts. Film scholar Vincent LoBrutto said the theatre of Max Reinhardt and the artistic style of Die Br\u00fccke were additional influences on Caligari."

        "title": "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari_Casting",
        "content": "Janowitz originally intended the part of Cesare to go to his friend, actor Ernst Deutsch. Mayer wrote the part of Jane for Gilda Langer, but by the time the film was cast Langer's interests had moved on from Janowitz and Mayer to director Paul Czinner, leaving the role to be played by Lil Dagover. Janowitz claimed he wrote the part of Caligari specifically for Werner Krauss, whom Deutsch had brought to his attention during rehearsals for a Max Reinhardt play; Janowitz said only Krauss or Paul Wegener could have played the part. The parts of Caligari and Cesare ultimately went to Krauss and Conrad Veidt, respectively, who enthusiastically took part in many aspects of the production. Krauss suggested changes to his own make-up and costumes, including the elements of a top hat, cape and walking stick with an ivory handle for his character. The actors in Caligari were conscious of the need to adapt their make-up, costumes and appearance to match the visual style of the film. Much of the acting in German silent films at the time was already Expressionistic, mimicking the pantomimic aspects of Expressionist theatre. The performances of Krauss and Veidt in Caligari were typical of this style, as they both had experience in Expressionist-influenced theatre, and as a result, John D. Barlow said they appear more comfortable in their surroundings in the film than the other actors. Prior to filming, Kraus and Veidt appeared on stage in the winter of 1918 in an Expressionist drama, Reinhold Goering's Seeschlacht, at the Deutsches Theater. By contrast, Dagover had little experience in Expressionist theatre, and Barlow argues her acting is less harmonious with the film's visual style. Wiene asked the actors to make movements similar to dance, most prominently from Veidt, but also from Krauss, Dagover and Friedrich Feger, who played Francis. Krauss and Veidt are the only actors whose performances fully match the stylization of the sets, which they achieved by concentrating their movements and facial expressions. Barlow notes that \"Veidt moves along the wall as if it had 'exuded' him ... more a part of a material world of objects than a human one\", and Krauss \"moves with angular viciousness, his gestures seem broken or cracked by the obsessive force within him, a force that seems to emerge from a constant toxic state, a twisted authoritarianism of no human scruple and total insensibility\". Most of the other actors besides Krauss and Veidt have a more naturalistic style. Alan, Jane and Francis play the roles of an idyllically happy trio enjoying youth; Alan in particular represents the archetype of a sensitive 19th-century student. Mike Budd points out realist characters in stylized settings are a common characteristic in Expressionist theatre. However, David Robinson notes even the performances of the more naturalistic supporting roles in Caligari have Expressionist elements, like Hans-Heinz von Twardowski's \"strange, tormented face\" as Alan. He also cites Feher's \"large angular movements\", especially in the scene where he searches the deserted fairground. Other minor roles are Expressionistic in nature, like two policemen who sit facing each other at their desks and move with exaggerated symmetry, and two servants who awaken and rise from their beds in perfect synchronization. Vincent LoBrutto said of the acting in the film:"

        "title": "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari_Filming",
        "content": "Shooting for The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari began at the end of December 1919 and concluded at the end of January 1920. It was shot entirely in a studio without any exterior shots, which was unusual for films of the time, but dictated by the decision to give the film an Expressionist visual style. The extent to which Mayer and Janowitz participated during filming is disputed: Janowitz claims the duo repeatedly refused to allow any script changes during production, and Pommer claimed Mayer was on the set for every day of filming. Hermann Warm, however, claimed they were never present for any of the shooting or involved in any discussions during production. Caligari was filmed in the Lixie-Atelier film studio (formerly owned by Continental-Kunstfilm) at 9 Franz Joseph-Strasse (now Max Liebermannstra\u00dfe), Wei\u00dfensee, a north-eastern suburb of Berlin. Decla had been making films at the Lixie studio since October 1919, having previously released three titles, The Plague of Florence (Die Pest in Florenz) (1919) and the two parts of The Spiders (Die Spinnen). The relatively small size of the studio (built some five years earlier in 1914) meant most of the sets used in the film did not exceed six meters in width and depth. Certain elements from the original script had to be cut from the film due to the limited space, including a procession of gypsies, a handcart pushed by Caligari, Jane's carriage, and a chase scene involving horse-cabs. Likewise, the script called for a fairground scene with roundabouts, barrel organs, sideshow barkers, performers and menageries, none of which could be achieved in the restrictive space. Instead, the scenes use a painting of the Holstenwall town as a background; throngs of people walk around two spinning merry-go-round props, which creates the impression of a carnival. The script also made references to modern elements like telephones, telegrams and electric light, but they were eliminated during the filming, leaving the final film's setting with no indication of a specific time period. Several scenes from the script were cut during filming, most of which were brief time lapses or transitioning scenes, or title screens deemed unnecessary. One of the more substantial scenes to be cut involved the ghost of Alan at a cemetery. The scene with the town clerk berating Caligari deviated notably from the original script, which simply called for the clerk to be \"impatient\". He is far more abusive in the scene as it was filmed, and is perched atop an exaggeratedly high bench that towers over Caligari. Another deviation from the script comes when Caligari first awakens Cesare, one of the most famous moments in the film. The script called for Cesare to gasp and struggle for air, then shake violently and collapse in Caligari's arms. As it was filmed, there is no such physical struggling, and instead the camera zooms in on Cesare's face as he gradually opens his eyes. The original title cards for Caligari featured stylized, misshapen lettering with excessive underlinings, exclamation points and occasionally archaic spellings. The bizarre style, which matches that of the film as a whole, mimics the lettering of Expressionistic posters at the time. The original title cards were tinted in green, steely-blue and brown. Many modern prints of the film do not preserve the original lettering. Photography was provided by Willy Hameister, who went on to work with Wiene on several other films. The camerawork in Caligari is fairly simple and is used primarily to show the sets, mostly alternating between medium shots and straight-on angles, with occasionally abrupt close-ups to create a sense of shock. There are few long shots or panning movement within the cinematography. Likewise, there is very little interscene editing. Most scenes follow the other without intercutting, which gives Caligari more of a theatrical feel than a cinematic one. Heavy lighting is typically absent from the film, heightening the sense of darkness prevalent in the story. However, lighting is occasionally used to intensify the uneasiness created by the distortions of the sets. For example, when Cesare first awakens at the fair, a light is shone directly on a close-up of his heavily made-up face to create an unsettling glow. Additionally, lighting is used in a then-innovative way to cast a shadow against the wall during the scene in which Cesare kills Alan, so the viewer sees only the shadow and not the figures themselves. Lighting techniques like this became frequently used in later German films."

        "title": "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari_Visual style",
        "content": "The visual style of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is dark, twisted and bizarre; radical and deliberate distortions in perspective, form, dimension and scale create a chaotic and unhinged appearance. The sets are dominated by sharp-pointed forms and oblique and curving lines, with narrow and spiraling streets, and structures and landscapes that lean and twist in unusual angles, giving the impression they could collapse or explode at any given moment. Film critic Roger Ebert described it as \"a jagged landscape of sharp angles and tilted walls and windows, staircases climbing crazy diagonals, trees with spiky leaves, grass that looks like knives\". The sets are characterized by strokes of bold, black paint. The landscape of Holstenwall is painted on canvas, as opposed to a constructed set, and shadows and streaks of light are painted directly onto the sets, further distorting the viewer's sense of perspective and three-dimensionality. Buildings are clustered and interconnected in a cubist-like architecture, surrounded by dark and twisted back alleys. Lotte Eisner, author of The Haunted Screen, writes that objects in the film appear as if they are coming alive and \"seem to vibrate with an extraordinary spirituality\". Rudolf Kurtz, screenwriter and author of Expressionismus und Film, likewise wrote \"the dynamic force of objects howls their desire to be created\". The rooms have radically offset windows with distorted frames, doors that are not squared, and chairs that are too tall. Strange designs and figures are painted on the walls of corridors and rooms, and trees outside have twisted branches that sometimes resemble tentacles. German film professor Anton Kaes wrote, \"The style of German Expressionism allowed the filmmakers to experiment with filmic technology and special effects and to explore the twisted realm of repressed desires, unconscious fears, and deranged fixations\". The visual style of Caligari conveys a sense of anxiety and terror to the viewer, giving the impression of a nightmare or deranged sensibility, or a place transformed by evil, in a more effective way than realistic locations or conventional design concepts could. Siegfried Kracauer wrote that the settings \"amounted to a perfect transformation of material objects into emotional ornaments\". The majority of the film's story and scenes are memories recalled by an insane narrator, and as a result the distorted visual style takes on the quality of his mental breakdown, giving the viewers the impression that they are inside the mind of a madman. As with contemporary Expressionist paintings, the visual style of Caligari reflects an emotional reaction to the world, and the film's characters represent an emotional response to the terror of society as embodied by Caligari and Cesare. Often in the film, set pieces are emblematic of the emotional state of the characters in the scene. For example, the courtyard of the insane asylum during the frame story is vastly out of proportion. The characters seem too big for the small building, and the courtyard floor features a bizarre pattern, all of which represent the patients' damaged frames of mind. Likewise, the scene with the criminal in a prison cell features a set with long vertical painted shadows resembling arrowheads, pointing down at the squatting prisoner in an oppressive effect that symbolizes his broken-down state. Stephen Brockmann argues the fact that Caligari was filmed entirely in a studio enhances the madness portrayed by the film's visuals because \"there is no access to a natural world beyond the realm of the tortured human psyche\". The sets occasionally feature circular images that reflect the chaos of the film, presenting patterns of movement that seem to be going nowhere, such as the merry-go-round at the fair, moving at a titled angle that makes it appear at risk of collapsing. Other elements of the film convey the same visual motifs as the sets, including the costumes and make-up design for Caligari and Cesare, both of which are highly exaggerated and grotesque. Even the hair of the characters is an Expressionistic design element, especially Cesare's black, spiky, jagged locks. They are the only two characters in the film with Expressionistic make-up and costumes, making them appear as if they are the only ones who truly belong in this distorted world. Despite their apparent normalcy, however, Francis and the other characters never appear disturbed by the madness around them reflected in the sets; they instead react as if they are parts of a normal background. A select few scenes disrupt the Expressionistic style of the film, such as in Jane's and Alan's home, which include normal backgrounds and bourgeois furniture that convey a sense of security and tranquility otherwise absent from the film. Eisner called this a \"fatal\" continuity error, but John D. Barlow disagrees, arguing it is a common characteristic for dream narratives to have some normal elements in them, and that the normalcy of Jane's house in particular could represent the feeling of comfort and refuge Francis feels in her presence. Mike Budd argues while the Expressionistic visual style is jarring and off-putting at first, the characters start to blend more harmoniously as the film progresses, and the setting becomes more relegated into the background. Robinson suggested Caligari is not a true example of Expressionism at all, but simply a conventional story with some elements of the art form applied to it. He argues the story itself is not Expressionistic, and the film could have easily been produced in a traditional style, but that Expressionist-inspired visuals were applied to it as decoration. Similarly, Budd has called the film a conventional, classical narrative, resembling a detective story in Francis's search to expose Alan's killer, and said it is only the film's Expressionist settings that make the film transgressive. Hans Janowitz has entertained similar thoughts as well: \"Was this particular style of painting only a garment in which to dress the drama? Was it only an accident? Would it not have been possible to change this garment, without injury to the deep effect of the drama? I do not know.\""

        "title": "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari_Release",
        "content": "Though often considered an art film by some modern critics and scholars, Caligari was produced and marketed the same way as a normal commercial production of its time period, able to target both the elite artistic market as well as a more commercial horror genre audience. The film was marketed extensively leading up to the release, and advertisements ran even before the film was finished. Many posters and newspaper advertisements included the enigmatic phrase featured in the film, \"Du musst Caligari werden!\", or \"You must become Caligari!\" Caligari premiered at the Marmorhaus theatre in Berlin on 26 February 1920, less than one month after it was completed. The filmmakers were so nervous about the release that Erich Pommer, on his way to the theatre, reportedly exclaimed, \"It will be a horrible failure for all of us!\" As with the making of the film, several urban legends surround the film's premiere. One, offered by writers Roger Manvell and Heinrich Fraenkel in The German Cinema, suggests the film was shelved \"for lack of a suitable outlet\", and was only shown at Marmorhaus because another film had fallen through. Another suggested the theatre pulled the film after only two performances because audiences demanded refunds and demonstrated against it so strongly. This story was told by Pommer, who claimed the Marmorhaus picked Caligari back up and ran it successfully for three months after he spent six months working on a publicity campaign for the film. David Robinson wrote that neither of these urban legends were true, and that the latter was fabricated by Pommer to increase his own reputation. On the contrary, Robinson said the premiere was highly successful, showing at the theatre for four weeks, an unusual amount for the time, and then returning two weeks later. He said it was so well received that women in the audience screamed when Cesare opened his eyes during his first scene, and fainted during the scene in which Cesare abducts Jane. Caligari was released at a time when foreign film industries had just started easing restrictions on the import of German films following World War I. The film was acquired for American distribution by the Goldwyn Distributing Company, and had its American premiere at the Capitol Theatre in New York City on 3 April 1921. It was given a live theatrical prologue and epilogue, which was not unusual for film premieres at major theatres at the time. In the prologue, the film is introduced by a character called \"Cranford\", who identifies himself as the man Francis speaks with in the opening scene. In the epilogue, Cranford returns and exclaims that Francis has fully recovered from his madness. Mike Budd believes these additions simplified the film and \"adjusted [it] for mass consumption\", though Robinson argued it was simply a normal theatrical novelty for the time. Capitol Theatre runner Samuel Roxy Rothafel commissioned conductor Ern\u00f6 Rap\u00e9e to compile a musical accompaniment that included portions of songs by composers Johann Strauss III, Arnold Schoenberg, Claude Debussy, Igor Stravinsky and Sergei Prokofiev. Rotafel wanted the score to match the dark mood of the film, saying: \"The music had, as it were, to be made eligible for citizenship in a nightmare country\". Caligari had its Los Angeles premiere at Miller's Theater on 7 May 1921, but the theatre was forced to pull it due to demonstrations by protestors. However, the protest was organized by the Hollywood branch of the American Legion due to fears of unemployment stemming from the import of German films into America, not over objections to the content of Caligari itself. After running in large commercial theatres, Caligari began to be shown in smaller theatres and film societies in major cities. Box office figures were not regularly published in the 1920s, so it has been difficult to assess the commercial success or failure of Caligari in the United States. Film historians Kristin Thompson and David B. Pratt separately studied trade publications from the time in an attempt to make a determination, but reached conflicting findings; Thompson concluded it was a box office success and Pratt concluded it was a failure. However, both agreed it was more commercially successful in major cities than in theatres in smaller communities, where tastes were considered more conservative. Caligari did not immediately receive a wide distribution in France due to fears over the import of German films, but film director Louis Delluc organized a single screening of it on 14 November 1921, at the Colis\u00e9e cinema in Paris as part of a benefit performance for the Spanish Red Cross. Afterward, the Cosmograph company bought the film's distribution rights and premiered it at the Cin\u00e9-Op\u00e9ra on 2 March 1922. Caligari played in one Paris theatre for seven consecutive years, a record that remained intact until the release of Emmanuelle (1974). According to Janowitz, Caligari was also shown in such European cities as London, Rome, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Brussels, Prague, Vienna, Budapest and Bucharest, as well as outside Europe in China, Japan, India and Turkey, and also in South American nations."

        "title": "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari_Critical response",
        "content": "There are differing accounts as to how Caligari was first received by audiences and critics immediately after its release. Stephen Brockmann, Anton Kaes and film theorist Kristin Thompson say it was popular with both the general public and well-respected by critics. Robinson wrote, \"The German critics, almost without exception, ranged from favourable to ecstatic\". Kracauer said critics were \"unanimous in praising Caligari as the first work of art on the screen\", but also said it was \"too high-brow to become popular in Germany\". Barlow said it was often the subject of critical disapproval, which he believes is because early film reviewers attempted to assign fixed definitions to the young art of cinema, and thus had trouble accepting the bizarre and unusual elements of Caligari. Some critics felt it imitated a stage production too closely. Other commentators, like critic Herbert Ihering and novelist Blaise Cendrars, objected to the presentation of the story as a madman's delusion because they felt it belittled Expressionism as an artform. Theatre critic Helmut Grosse condemned the film's visual design as clich\u00e9d and derivative, calling it a \"cartoon and [a] reproduction of designs rather than from what actually took place on stage\". Several reviewers, like Kurt Tucholsky and Blaise Cendrars, criticized the use of real actors in front of artificially-painted sets, saying it created an inconsistent level of stylization. Critic Herbert Ihering echoed this point in a 1920 review: \"If actors are acting without energy and are playing within landscapes and rooms which are formally 'excessive', the continuity of the principle is missing\". While Robinson said the response from American critics was largely positive and enthusiastic, Kaes said American critics and audiences were divided: some praised its artistic value and others, particularly those distrustful of Germany following World War I, wished to ban it altogether. Some in the Hollywood film industry felt threatened by the potential rivalry and spoke out against Caligari's release, condemning it as a \"foreign invasion\". Nevertheless, the film remained popular in the United States. Several American reviewers compared it to an Edgar Allan Poe story, including in a 1921 review in Variety magazine, which praised the direction and \"perfect tempo\" of the film, as well as the sets that \"squeeze and turn and adjust the eye, and through the eye the mentality\". A New York Times review likened it to modernist art, comparing the film's sets to Marcel Duchamp's Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2, and said the film \"gives dimensions and meaning to shape, making it an active part of the story, instead of merely the conventional and inert background\", which was key to the film's \"importance as a work of cinematography\". Albert Lewin, a critic who eventually became a film director and screenwriter, called Caligari \"the only serious picture, exhibited in America so far, that in anything like the same degree has the authentic thrills and shock of art\". A story in a November 1921 edition of Exceptional Photoplays, an independent publication issued by the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, said it \"occupies the position of unique artistic merit\", and said American films in comparison looked like they were made for \"a group of defective adults at the nine-year-old level\". Caligari was a critical success in France, but French filmmakers were divided in their opinions after its release. Abel Gance called it \"superb\" and wrote, \"What a lesson to all directors!\" and Ren\u00e9 Clair said it \"overthrew the realist dogma\" of filmmaking. Film critic and director Louis Delluc said the film has a compelling rhythm: \"At first slow, deliberately laborious, it attempts to irritate. Then when the zigzag motifs of the fairground start turning, the pace leaps forward, agitato, accelerando, and leaves off only at the word 'End', as abruptly as a slap in the face.\" Jean Epstein, however, called it \"a prize example of the abuse of d\u00e9cor in the cinema\" and said it \"represents a grave sickness of cinema\". Likewise, Jean Cocteau called it \"the first step towards a grave error which consists of flat photography of eccentric decors, instead of obtaining surprise by means of the camera\". French critic Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric-Philippe Amiguet wrote of the film: \"It has the odor of tainted food. It leaves a taste of cinders in the mouth.\" The Russian director Sergei Eisenstein especially disliked Caligari, calling it a \"combination of silent hysteria, partially coloured canvases, daubed flats, painted faces, and the unnatural broken gestures and action of monstrous chimaeras\". While early reviews were more divided, modern film critics and historians have largely praised Caligari as a revolutionary film. Film reviewer Roger Ebert called it arguably \"the first true horror film\", and critic Danny Peary called it cinema's first cult film and a precursor for arthouse films. In October 1958, Caligari was ranked as the twelfth-best film of all time during a poll organized at the Brussels World's Fair. With input from 117 film critics, filmmakers and historians from around the world, it was the first universal film poll in history. American film historian Lewis Jacobs said \"its stylized rendition, brooding quality, lack of explanation, and distorted settings were new to the film world\". Film historian and critic Paul Rotha wrote of it, \"For the first time in the history of the cinema, the director has worked through the camera and broken with realism on the screen; that a film could be effective dramatically when not photographic and finally, of the greatest possible importance, that the mind of the audience was brought into play psychologically\". Likewise, Arthur Knight wrote in Rogue: \"More than any other film, (Caligari) convinced artists, critics and audiences that the movie was a medium for artistic expression\". Entertainment Weekly included Caligari in their 1994 \"Guide to the Greatest Movies Ever Made\", calling it a \"landmark silent film\" and saying, \"No other film's art direction has ever come up with so original a visualization of dementia\". The film holds an approval rating of 99% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 67 reviews, with a weighted average of 9.30/10. The site's critics' consensus states: \"Arguably the first true horror film, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari set a brilliantly high bar for the genre \u2013 and remains terrifying nearly a century after it first stalked the screen.\""

        "title": "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari_Legacy",
        "content": "Caligari is considered the quintessential work of German Expressionist cinema, and by far the most famous example of it. It is considered a classic film, often shown in introductory film courses, film societies and museums, and is one of the most famous German films from the silent era. Film scholar Lewis Jacobs called it the \"most widely discussed film of the time\". Caligari helped draw worldwide attention to the artistic merit of German cinema, while also bringing legitimacy to the cinema among literary intellectuals within Germany itself. Lotte Eisner has said it was in Expressionism, as epitomized in Caligari, that \"the German cinema found its true nature\". The term caligarism was coined as a result, referring to a style of similar films that focus on such themes as bizarre madness and obsession, particularly through the use of visual distortion. Expressionism was late in coming to cinema, and by the time Caligari was released, many German critics felt the art form had become commercialized and trivialized; such well-known writers as Kasimir Edschmid, Ren\u00e9 Schickele, and Yvan Goll had already pronounced the Expressionist movement dead by the time Caligari arrived in theatres. Few other purely Expressionistic films were produced, and Caligari was the only one readily accessible for several decades. Among the few films to fully embrace the Expressionist style were  Genuine (1920) and Raskolnikow (1923), both directed by Wiene, as well as From Morn to Midnight (1920), Torgus (1921), Das Haus zum Mond (1921), Haus ohne T\u00fcr und ohne Fenster (1921) and Waxworks. While few other purely Expressionistic films were made, Caligari still had a major influence over other German directors, and many of the film's Expressionist elements \u2013 particularly the use of setting, light and shadow to represent the dark psychology of its characters \u2013 became prevalent in German cinema. Among the films to use these elements were Murnau's Nosferatu (1922) and The Last Laugh (1924), G. W. Pabst's Secrets of a Soul (1926), and Lang's Metropolis (1927) and M (1931). The success of Caligari also affected the way in which German films were produced during the 1920s. For example, the majority of major German films over the next few years moved away from location shooting and were fully filmed in studios, which assigned much more importance to designers in German cinema. Robinson argues this led to the rise of a large number of film designers \u2013 such as Hans Dreier, Rochus Gliese, Albin Grau, Otto Hunte, Alfred Junge, Erich Kettelhut and Paul Leni \u2013 and that effect was felt abroad as many of these talents later emigrated from Germany with the rise of the National Socialist German Workers Party. Additionally, the success of Caligari's collaborative effort \u2013 including its director, set designers and actors \u2013 influenced subsequent film production in Germany for many years, making teamwork a hallmark of German cinema in the Weimar Republic. The effect of Caligari was felt not just in German cinema, but internationally as well. Both Rotha and film historian William K. Everson wrote that the film probably had as much of a long-term effect on Hollywood directors as Battleship Potemkin (1925). In his book The Film Til Now, Rotha wrote that Caligari and Potemkin were the \"two most momentous advances in the development of the cinema\", and said Caligari \"served to attract to the cinema audience many people who had hitherto regarded the film as the low watermark of intelligence\". Caligari influenced the style and content of Hollywood films in the 1920s and early 1930s, particularly in films such as The Bells (1926), The Man Who Laughs (1928) and Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932), and had a major influence on American horror films of the 1930s, some of which featured an antagonist using Caligari-like supernatural abilities to control others, such as Dracula (1931), Svengali (1931) and The Mad Genius (1931). Kaes said both Caligari's stylistic elements, and the Cesare character in particular, influenced the Universal Studios horror films of the 1930s, which often prominently featured some sort of monster, such as Frankenstein (1931), The Mummy (1932), The Black Cat (1934), and Bride of Frankenstein (1935). The Expressionism of Caligari also influenced American avant-garde film, particularly those that used fantastic settings to illustrate an inhuman environment overpowering an individual. Early examples include The Fall of the House of Usher (1928), The Last Moment (1928) and The Life and Death of 9413: a Hollywood Extra (1928). LoBrutto wrote, \"Few films throughout motion picture history have had more influence on the avant-garde, art, and student cinema than Caligari\". Caligari and German Expressionism heavily influenced the American film noir period of the 1940s and '50s, both in visual style and narrative tone. Noir films tended to portray everyone, even the innocent, as the object of suspicion, a common thread in Caligari.  The genre also employs several Expressionistic elements in its dark and shadowy visual style, stylized and abstract photography, and distorted and expressive make-up and acting. Caligari also influenced films produced in the Soviet Union, such as Aelita (1924) and The Overcoat (1926). Observers have noted the black and white films of Ingmar Bergman bear a resemblance to the German films of the 1920s, and film historian Roy Armes has called him \"the true heir\" of Caligari. Bergman himself, however, has downplayed the influence of German Expressionism on his work. Caligari has also affected stage theatre. Siegfried Kracauer wrote that the film's use of the iris shot has been mimicked in theatrical productions, with lighting used to single out a lone actor. Caligari continues to be one of the most discussed and debated films from the Weimar Republic. Two major books have played a large part in shaping the perception of the film and its effect on cinema as a whole: Siegfried Kracauer's From Caligari to Hitler (1947) and Lotte Eisner's The Haunted Screen (1974). From Caligari to Hitler based its claims about the film largely on an unpublished typescript by Hans Janowitz called Caligari: The Story of a Famous Story, which gave Janowitz and Carl Mayer principal credit for the making of Caligari. Mike Budd wrote of Kracauer's book: \"Perhaps no film or period has been so thoroughly understood through a particular interpretation as has Caligari, and Weimar cinema generally, through Kracauer's social-psychological approach\". Prior to the publication of From Caligari to Hitler, few critics had derived any symbolic political meaning from the film, but Kracauer's argument that it symbolized German obedience toward authority and a premonition of the rise of Adolf Hitler drastically changed attitudes about Caligari. Many of his interpretations of the film are still embraced, even by those who have strongly disagreed with his general premise, and even as certain claims Kracauer made have been disproven, such as his statement that the original script included no frame story. Eisner's book, meanwhile, placed Caligari into historical context by identifying how it influenced Expressionist features in other films of the 1920s. Film historian David Robinson claimed Wiene, despite being the director of Caligari, is often given the least amount of credit for its production. He believes this is in part because Wiene died in 1938, closer to the release of the film than any other major collaborators, and was therefore unable to defend his involvement in the work while others took credit. In fact, Robinson argues Caligari ultimately hurt Wiene's reputation because his subsequent films did not match its success, so he is often wrongly considered \"a one-film director\" for whom Caligari was \"a lucky fluke\"."

        "title": "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari_Authority and conformity",
        "content": "Caligari, like a number of Weimar films that followed it, thematizes brutal and irrational authority by making a violent and possibly insane authority figure its antagonist. Kracauer said Caligari was symbolic of the German war government and fatal tendencies inherent in the German system, saying the character \"stands for an unlimited authority that idolizes power as such, and, to satisfy its lust for domination, ruthlessly violates all human rights and values\". Likewise, John D. Barlow described Caligari as an example of the tyrannical power and authority that had long plagued Germany, while Cesare represents the \"common man of unconditional obedience\". Janowitz has claimed Cesare represents the common citizen who is conditioned to kill or be killed, just as soldiers are trained during their military service, and that Caligari is symbolic of the German government sending those soldiers off to die in the war. The control Caligari wields over the minds and actions of others results in chaos and both moral and social perversion. Cesare lacks any individuality and is simply a tool of his master; Barlow writes that he is so dependent on Caligari that he falls dead when he strays too far from the source of his sustenance, \"like a machine that has run out of fuel\". In his book From Caligari to Hitler, Kracauer argues the Caligari character is symptomatic of a subconscious need in German society for a tyrant, which he calls the German \"collective soul\". Kracauer argues Caligari and Cesare are premonitions of Adolf Hitler and his rule over Germany, and that his control over the weak-willed, puppet-like somnambulist prefigures aspects of the mentality that allowed the Nazi Party to rise. He calls Caligari's use of hypnotism to impose his will foreshadowing of Hitler's \"manipulation of the soul\". Kracauer described the film as an example of Germany's obedience to authority and failure or unwillingness to rebel against deranged authority, and reflects a \"general retreat\" into a shell that occurred in post-war Germany. Cesare symbolizes those who have no mind of their own and must follow the paths of others; Kracauer wrote he foreshadows a German future in which \"self-appointed Caligaris hypnotized innumerable Cesares into murder\". Barlow rejects Kracauer's claims that the film glorifies authority \"just because it has not made a preachy statement against it\", and said the connection between Caligari and Hitler lies in the mood the film conveys, not an endorsement of such tyrant on the film's part. Everyday reality in Caligari is dominated by tyrannical aspects. Authorities sit atop high perches above the people they deal with and hold offices out of sight at the end of long, forbidding stairways. Most of the film's characters are caricatures who fit neatly into prescribed social roles, such as the outraged citizens chasing a public enemy, the authoritarian police who are deferential to their superiors, the oft-harassed bureaucratic town clerk, and the asylum attendants who act like stereotypical \"little men in white suits\". Only Caligari and Cesare are atypical of social roles, instead serving as, in Barlow's words, \"abstractions of social fears, the incarnations of demonic forces of a nightmarish world the bourgeoisie was afraid to acknowledge, where self-assertion is pushed to willful and arbitrary power over others\". Kracauer wrote the film demonstrates a contrast between the rigid control, represented by such characters as Caligari and the town clerk, and chaos, represented by the crowds of people at the fair and the seemingly never-ending spinning of the merry-go-rounds. He said the film leaves no room for middle ground between these two extremes, and that viewers are forced to embrace either insanity or authoritarian rigidity, leaving little space for human freedom. Kracauer writes: \"Caligari exposes the soul wavering between tyranny and chaos, and facing a desperate situation: any escape from tyranny seems to throw it into a state of utter confusion\". Caligari is not the only symbol of arrogant authority in the film. In fact, he is a victim of harsh authority himself during the scene with the dismissive town clerk, who brushes him off and ignores him to focus on his paperwork. Film historian Thomas Elsaesser argues that Caligari's murderous rampage through Cesare can be seen as a rebellious, anti-authoritarian streak in response to such experiences as these, even in spite of his own authoritarianism. The Expressionistic set design in this scene further amplifies the power of the official and the weakness of his supplicant; the clerk towers in an excessively high chair over the small and humiliated Caligari. The scene represents class and status differences, and conveys the psychological experience of being simultaneously outraged and powerless in the face of a petty bureaucracy. Another common visual motif is the use of stairways to illustrate the hierarchy of authority figures, such as the multiple stairs leading up to police headquarters, and three staircases ascending to Caligari in the asylum. Francis expresses resentment of all forms of authority, particularly during the end of the frame story, when he feels he has been institutionalized because of the madness of the authorities, not because there is anything wrong with him. Francis can be seen, at least within the main narrative, as a symbol of reason and enlightenment triumphing over the irrational tyrant and unmasking the absurdity of social authority. But Kracauer contended the frame story undermines that premise. He argues if not for the frame story, the tale of Francis's efforts against Caligari would have been a praiseworthy example of independence and rebellion against authority. However, with the addition of the frame story, which places the veracity of Francis's claims into question, Kracauer argues the film glorifies authority and turns a reactionary story into an authoritarian film: \"The result of these modifications was to falsify the action and to ultimately reduce it to the ravings of a madman.\" Kracauer believed these changes were not necessarily intentional, but rather an \"instinctive submission to the necessities of the screen\" because commercial films had to \"answer to mass desires\". Fritz Lang disagreed with Kracauer's argument, and instead believes the frame story makes the film's revolutionary inclinations more convincing, not less. David Robinson said, as time passed, filmgoers have been less inclined to interpret the film as a vindication of authority because modern audiences have grown more skeptical of authority in general, and are more inclined to believe Francis's story and interpret the asylum director as wrongly committing Francis to silence him."

        "title": "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari_Point of view and perception of reality",
        "content": "Another major theme of Caligari is, Stephen Brockmann writes, \"the destabilized contrast between insanity and sanity and hence the destabilization of the very notion of sanity itself\". By the end of the film, according to Brockman, viewers realize the story they have been watching has been told from the perspective of an insane narrator, and therefore they cannot accept anything they have seen as reliable. The film's unusual visual abstractions and other stylized elements serve to show the world as one experienced by a madman. Similarly, the film has been described as portraying the story as a nightmare and the frame story as the real world. John D. Barlow said the film exemplifies a common Expressionist theme that \"the ultimate perception of reality will appear distorted and insane to the healthy and practical mind\". The film serves as a reminder that any story told through a flashback subjectivizes the story from the perspective of the narrator. At the end of the film, the asylum director gives no indication that he means Francis ill will, and in fact he seems, to Barlow, to truly care for his patients. But Francis nevertheless believes he is being persecuted, so in the story as told from his perspective, Caligari takes on the role of persecutor. However, the Expressionistic visual elements of the film are present not only in the main narrative, but also in the epilogue and prologue scenes of the frame story, which are supposed to be an objective account of reality. For example, the frame story scenes still have trees with tentacle-like branches and a high, foreboding wall in the background. Strange leaf and line patterns are seen on the bench Francis sits upon, flame-like geometric designs can be seen on the walls, and his asylum cell has the same distorted shape as in the main narrative. If the primary story were strictly the delusions of a madman, the frame story would be completely devoid of those elements, but the fact they are present makes it unclear whether that perspective can be taken as reliable either. Instead, the film offers no true or normal world to oppose to that of the twisted and nightmarish world as described by Francis. As a result, after the film's closing scene, it can be seen as ambiguous whether Francis or the asylum director is truly the insane one, or whether both are insane. Likewise, the final shot of the film, with an iris that fades to a close-up on the asylum director's face, further creates doubt over whether the character is actually sane and trustworthy. In Brockman's words, \"In the end, the film is not just about one unfortunate madman; it is about an entire world that is possibly out of balance\". Mike Budd notes that, during the scene in which asylum doctors restrain Francis, his movements closely mimic those of Caligari from a similar scene during the main story. Budd says this suggests a \"dream logic of repetition\" that throws further confusion on which perspective is reality. Beyond Francis's individual circumstances, the use of the narrator's perspective in Dr. Caligari can be seen as reflective of a worldview of the screenwriters. Mayer and Janowitz were pacifists opposed to what Eisner described as the willingness of Germans to commit themselves to the dark forces, such as demoniac magic and supernatural powers, that led to death on the battlefield. Although he does not think it possible to reduce the narrative or the film to the beliefs of its makers, Eisner claims Francis can be seen as embodying the politics of Expressionism's anti-naturalism, through which a protagonist does not see the world objectively, but has \"visions\" that are abstracted from individuality and psychology. The framing device of an insane asylum, for Eisner, has a broader connotation as a statement on social reality in the context of the \"state of exception\". Here, Eisner claims, the militarist and imperialist tendency of monopoly capitalism is combined with what Sigmund Freud would later refer to as the longing for protection by a tyrannical father figure, or what Kracauer characterized as \"asocial authority\"."

        "title": "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari_Double life",
        "content": "Duality is another common theme in Caligari. Caligari is portrayed in the main narrative as an insane tyrant, and in the frame story as a respected authority and director of a mental institution. As a result of this duality, it is possible for the viewer to suspect a malevolent aspect of him at the conclusion of the film, even despite evidence indicating he is a kind and caring man. Even within the main narrative alone, Caligari lives a double life: holding a respectable position as the asylum director, but becoming a hypnotist and murderer at night. Additionally, the character is actually a double of the \"real\" Caligari, an 18th-century mystic whom the film character becomes so obsessed with that he desires to penetrate his innermost secrets and \"become Caligari\". Francis also takes on a double life of sorts, serving as the heroic protagonist in the main narrative and a patient in a mental institution in the frame story. Anton Kaes described the story Francis tells as an act of transference with his psychiatrist, as well as a projection of his feelings that he is a victim under the spell of the all-powerful asylum director, just as Cesare is the hypnotized victim of Caligari. The Cesare character serves as both a persecutor and a victim, as he is both a murderer and the unwilling slave of an oppressive master. Siegfried Kracauer said by coupling a fantasy in which Francis overthrows a tyrannical authority with a reality in which authority triumphs over Francis, Caligari reflects a double aspect of German life, suggesting they reconsider their traditional belief in authority even as they embrace it. A contrast between levels of reality exists not only in the characterizations, but in the presentation of some of the scenes as well. This, Barlow writes, \"reveals a contrast between external calm and internal chaos\". For example, flashback scenes when Francis reads Caligari's diary, in which the doctor is shown growing obsessed with learning hypnotic powers, take place as Caligari is sleeping peacefully in the present. Another example is the fair, which on the surface appears to represent fun and escapism, but reveals a lurking sense of chaos and disaster in the form of Caligari and Cesare. The visual elements of the film also convey a sense of duality, particularly in the contrasts between black and white. This is especially prevalent in the sets, where black shadows are set against white walls, but also in other elements like the costumes and make-up. For instance, Caligari wears mostly black, but white streaks are present in his hair and on his gloves. Cesare's face is a ghostly white, but the darks of his eyes are heavily outlined in black. Likewise, Jane's white face contrasts with her deep, dark eyes."

        "content": "Critics have suggested that Caligari highlights some of the neuroses prevalent in Germany and the Weimar Republic when the film was made, particularly in the shadow of World War I, at a time when extremism was rampant, reactionaries still controlled German institutions, and citizens feared the harm the Treaty of Versailles would have on the economy. Siegfried Kracauer wrote that the paranoia and fear portrayed in the film were signs of things to come in Germany, and that the film reflected a tendency in Germans to \"retreat into themselves\" and away from political engagement following the war. Vincent LoBrutto wrote that the film can be seen as a social or political analogy of \"the moral and physical breakdown of Germany at the time, with a madman on the loose wreaking havoc on a distorted and off-balanced society, a metaphor for a country in chaos\". Anton Kaes, who called Caligari \"an aggressive statement about war psychiatry, murder and deception\", wrote that Alan's question to Cesare, \"How long have I to live?\" reflected the trauma German citizens experienced during the war, as that question was often on the minds of soldiers and of family members back home concerned about their loved ones in the military. Francis's despair after Alan's murder can likewise be compared to that of the many soldiers who survived the war but saw their friends die on the battlefield. Kaes noted other parallels between the film and war experiences, noting that Cesare attacked Alan at dawn, a common time for attacks during the war. Thomas Elsaesser called Caligari an \"outstanding example of how 'fantastic' representations in German films from the early 1920s seem to bear the imprint of pressures from external events, to which they refer only through the violence with which they disguise and disfigure them\"."

        "content": "Several unsuccessful attempts were made to produce sequels and remakes in the decades following Caligari's release. Robert Wiene bought the rights to Caligari from Universum Film AG in 1934 with the intention of filming a sound remake, which never materialized before Wiene's death in 1938. He intended to cast Jean Cocteau as Cesare, and a script, believed to be written by Wiene, indicated the Expressionist style would have been replaced with a French surrealist style. In 1944, Erich Pommer and Hans Janowitz each separately attempted to obtain the legal rights to the film, with hopes of a Hollywood remake. Pommer attempted to argue he had a better claim to the rights because the primary value of the original film came not from the writing, but \"in the revolutionary way the picture was produced\". However, both Janowitz and Pommer ran into complications related to the invalidity of Nazi law in the United States, and uncertainty over the legal rights of sound and silent films. Janowitz wrote a treatment for a remake, and in January 1945 was offered a minimum guarantee of $16,000 against a five-percent royalty for his rights to the original film for a sequel to be directed by Fritz Lang, but the project never came to fruition. Later, Janowitz planned a sequel called Caligari II, and unsuccessfully attempted to sell the property to a Hollywood producer for $30,000. Around 1947, Hollywood agent Paul Kohner and German filmmaker Ernst Matray also planned a Caligari sequel; Matray and his wife Maria Solveg wrote a screenplay called The Return of Caligari. That script would have reimagined Caligari as a former Nazi officer and war criminal, but the film was never produced. In 1960, independent Hollywood producer Robert Lippert acquired the rights to Caligari from Matray and Universum Film AG for $50,000, and produced a film called The Cabinet of Caligari, which was released in 1962. Screenwriter Robert Bloch did not intend to write a Caligari remake, and in fact the title was forced upon his untitled screenplay by director Roger Kay. The film had few similarities to the original Caligari except for its title and a plot twist at the end, in which it is revealed the story was simply the delusion of the protagonist, who believed she was being held captive by a character named Caligari. Instead, he was her psychiatrist, and he cures her at the end of the film. A quasi-sequel, called Dr. Caligari, was released in 1989, directed by Stephen Sayadian and starring Madeleine Reynal as the granddaughter of the original Caligari, now running an asylum and performing bizarre hormonal experiments on its patients. The sex-driven story ultimately had little in common with the original film. In 1992, theatre director Peter Sellars released his only feature film, The Cabinet of Dr. Ramirez, an experimental film loosely based on Caligari. However, the storyline was created as the film was being made, so it has few similarities with the original film. The film was screened only at the 1992 Sundance Film Festival and never theatrically released. An independent film remake of Caligari edited, written and directed by David Lee Fisher was released in 2005, in which new actors were placed in front of the actual backdrops from the original film. The actors performed in front of a green screen, then their performances were superimposed in front of matte shots based on the original sets. Doug Jones played the role of Cesare."

The Israeli Electronica group TaaPet composed a soundtrack for the film and performed it several times through Israel in 2000. The British composer and musician Geoff Smith composed a new soundtrack for the film in 2003.  The Dutch psychedelic band Monomyth composed a new score and performed it during a screening of Caligari at the Imagine Film Festival in the Netherlands in April 2016. Bertelsmann/BMG commissioned Timothy Brock to adapt his 1996 score for string orchestra for a 2014 restoration; Brock conducted the premiere in Brussels on 15 September 2014. In 2012, the Chatterbox Audio Theatre recorded a live soundtrack, including dialogue, sound effects, and music for Caligari, which was released on YouTube on 30 October 2013. Two new scores were recorded for a 2016 DVD release of Caligari: a traditional score by Timothy Brock performed by the Brussels Philharmonic, and an electroacoustic score by Edison Studio, a collective of composers. In 1981, Bill Nelson was asked by the Yorkshire Actors Company to create a soundtrack for a stage adaptation of the film. That music was later recorded for his 1982 album Das Kabinet (The Cabinet Of Doctor Caligari). In 1983, the German TV station ZDF commissioned composer Peter Michael Hamel to create a new score for a restoration of the film, based on a 1921 print. The version with Hamel's music premiered on ZDF in May 1983, and was subsequently broadcast during the 1980s and 1990s on TV stations in a number of European countries, including Spain and Poland. Caligari was adapted into an opera in 1997 by composer John Moran. It premiered at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a production by Robert McGrath. Joseph Kahn and Rob Zombie directed a music video for the 1999 single \"Living Dead Girl\" with imagery directly inspired by The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, with Zombie's wife Sheri Moon Zombie playing the Cesare part. In 2015, Indian scenographer and director Deepan Sivaraman adapted the film into an hour-long mixed-media piece with the performance studies students at Ambedkar University Delhi as part of a course entitled \"Space and Spectatorship\". Scottish Opera's Connect Company commissioned composer Karen MacIver and librettist Allan Dunn to produce an opera based on The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, which was first performed in 2016. Though it shared the same story as the film, the setting was changed to Glasgow Green and Gartloch in Glasgow, Scotland. In 2020, Spanish post-rock band Toundra has released their own soundtrack to the movie. It has been released exactly 100 years after the original film premiere. The album consists of 7 songs, which match the film structure - opening title sequence, plus six film acts. The songs are also the same length as the acts, so the music can be played along the film, perfectly synchronizing. The whole movie with the music can be seen on Vimeo platform, with original, and Spanish subtitles."

Asked by Mrs. Ward to come inside and warm up, Hannah sees they are struggling financially and are in need of some domestic help. She offers her services and becomes their cook and housekeeper for room and board. Mr. Ward, a science teacher by day, is an inventor by night attempting to create something that will provide sufficient money for Marcia, their teenaged daughter Sally (Granville) and their new baby, to have some luxuries in life. Hannah, who is extremely wise and helpful, comes up with some good ideas. She persuades Ward to sell old and useless furniture to raise money and make a place for his work in the basement. Their teenaged neighbor, Peter Trimble (Cooper), is one of Ward's students and the son of the richest man in town, Sam Trimble (O'Neill). Hannah is very pleased to know Peter and to be a part of his life. In her devotion to him, however, she is never able to indulge the motherly instinct she feels, except in an indirect way. He is very good at science and, after Hannah suggests that he set a good example for the boy, Ward asks young Trimble to become his assistant. Sally develops a crush on Peter. Ward's invention, an \"iceless icebox,\" is unintentionally revealed by Peter to local mechanics Joe Ellis (William Pawley) and his brother Bill (Edward Pawley). When the Ellis brothers steal it and have it patented, Peter feels so bad about what he did that he lies when Ward asks him about it. In the meantime, Sally becomes ill with pneumonia. Hannah persuades Ward that it is best to \"turn the other cheek\" and to give young Peter another chance. Ward then develops a new and better feature for his invention, which is on its way to becoming a great electric refrigerator for homes. Sally recovers and she and her mother, Marcia, leave on a trip with the baby. Another crisis arises, however, when Thomas Bradford (James Stephenson), a wealthy businessman from Chicago, arrives to discuss financing of Ward's invention. Hannah reveals to Ward that Peter Trimble is her son who she was forced to give up all those years ago because he was born out of wedlock. Sam Trimble adopted him after his own baby died, but Bradford is the boy's real father. When Bradford finds out that Peter is his son, he wants to claim him. Hannah, however, persuades him to not reveal the truth to Peter. Hannah, satisfied with the kind of young man her son has become, and that he is on the right path in life, leaves with Peter believing that his adoptive parents are his biological parents. She walks off into the wintry landscape."

        "content": "Bruce Almighty is a 2003 American fantasy comedy film directed by Tom Shadyac and written by Steve Koren, Mark O'Keefe and Steve Oedekerk. The film stars Jim Carrey as Bruce Nolan, a down-on-his-luck television reporter who complains to God (played by Morgan Freeman) that he is not doing his job correctly and is offered the chance to try being God himself for one week. The film is Shadyac and Carrey's third collaboration, as they had worked together previously on Ace Ventura: Pet Detective in 1994 and Liar Liar in 1997. It co-stars Jennifer Aniston, Philip Baker Hall and Steve Carell. When released in American theaters on May 23, 2003, Bruce Almighty opened to mixed reviews from critics, but was a box-office success and grossed $85.9 million, making it the top Memorial Day opening weekend of any film in history at the time. The film surprised film pundits when it beat The Matrix Reloaded the following weekend. By the end of its theatrical run, the film had made $242 million domestically and a total $484 million worldwide, making it Carrey's highest-grossing film worldwide, as well as the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2003. Evan Almighty, a spin-off sequel focusing on Steve Carell's character, with Shadyac and Oedekerk returning to direct and write, and Freeman also reprising his role, was released on June 22, 2007."

        "content": "Bruce Nolan is a television field reporter for Eyewitness News on WKBW-TV in Buffalo, New York, but desires to be the news anchorman. When Bruce is passed over for promotion by his rival, Evan Baxter, he becomes furious and vents on live T.V.; his actions lead to him being fired from the station. Following a series of misfortunes, Bruce takes his anger out on God and complains that \"He's the one that should be fired\". Bruce receives a message on his pager, which takes him to an empty warehouse where he meets God. God offers to give Bruce His powers to prove that He is doing the job correctly. God only gives Bruce two rules: he cannot tell others he has God's powers, nor can he use the powers to alter free will. Bruce is initially jubilant with the powers, using them for personal gain, such as exposing a woman's panties, getting his job back, and impressing his girlfriend, Grace Connelly. Bruce finds ways of using his powers around Buffalo to cause miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events that he covers, such as discovering Jimmy Hoffa's body or causing a meteor to harmlessly land near a cook-off, earning him the name \"Mr. Exclusive\". Bruce then causes Evan to embarrass himself on-air, causing Evan to be fired in favor of Bruce as the new anchor. During this, Bruce continues to hear voices in his head. He later re-encounters God, who explains that the voices are prayers, meant for God, that Bruce must deal with. Bruce creates a computerized email-like system to receive the prayers and respond but finds that the influx is far too many for him to handle\u2014even though God has stated that Bruce is only receiving prayers from a section of the Buffalo area\u2014and sets the program to answer every prayer Yes automatically. Bruce attends a party celebrating his promotion. When Grace arrives, she finds Bruce kissing his co-anchor, Susan Ortega, after she forcefully comes on to him, and quickly leaves. Bruce follows her, trying to use his powers to convince her to stay but cannot influence her free will. As Bruce looks around, he realizes that Buffalo has fallen into chaos due to his actions: parts of the city believe the Apocalypse is nearly upon Earth due to the meteor strikes, while a large number of people, all having prayed to win the multi-million dollar lottery and finding they all won reducing their prize to a few dollars, have started rioting in the streets. Bruce returns to God, who explains that He cannot solve all the problems and Bruce must figure out a way himself. Bruce then goes about helping people without using his powers, including giving Evan his job back. As Bruce reads through the prayers on his computer, he finds several from Grace, wishing for his success and well-being. As Bruce reads it, another prayer from Grace arrives, this one wishing to not be in love with him anymore. Bruce is stunned and walks alone on a highway. Heartbroken, he asks God to take back His powers and letting his fate be in His hands. Bruce is suddenly hit by a truck and regains his consciousness in a white void. God appears, and He asks Bruce what he really wants; Bruce admits that he only wants to make sure Grace finds a man that would make her happy. God agrees and brings Bruce back to life. Bruce wakes up and finds himself in the hospital. Grace arrives shortly after. She and Bruce rekindle their relationship, and later become engaged. Following his recovery, Bruce returns to field reporting, and continues to report offbeat news stories."

Wilson and Brent Maddock alongside Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman, from a story penned by brothers Jim and John Thomas. Loosely adapted from The Wild Wild West, a 1960s television series created by Michael Garrison, it is the only production since the television film More Wild Wild West (1980) to feature the characters from the original series. The film stars Will Smith (who previously collaborated with Sonnenfeld on Men in Black two years earlier) and Kevin Kline as two U.S. Secret Service agents who work together to protect U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant (Kline, in a dual role) and the United States from all manner of dangerous threats during the American Old West. The film features a supporting cast consisting of Kenneth Branagh, Salma Hayek, Ted Levine, and M. Emmet Walsh, as well as an orchestral film score by Western film score veteran Elmer Bernstein and extensive visual effects courtesy of Industrial Light & Magic. Released theatrically in the United States on June 30, 1999 by Warner Bros. and produced on a $170\u00a0million budget (making it one of the most expensive films ever made when adjusting for inflation at the time of its release), Wild Wild West was a commercial failure, grossing only $113.8\u00a0million domestically and $108.3\u00a0million overseas for a worldwide total of $222.1\u00a0million. Receiving negative reviews from critics, the film was nominated for eight Razzies and won five at the 20th Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture and Worst Original Song (for the song \"Wild Wild West\" by Smith)."

President Ulysses S. Grant informs the two about the disappearances of America's key scientists and a treasonous plot by McGrath, and gives them the task of finding the scientists. Aboard their train The Wanderer, West and Gordon examine the severed head of scientist Thaddeus Morton, finding a clue that leads them to Dr. Arliss Loveless, a legless ex-Confederate officer and engineering genius. Infiltrating Loveless's plantation during a party, the duo rescues a woman named Rita Escobar, who asks for their help in rescuing her father, Guillermo Escobar, one of the kidnapped scientists. Loveless holds a demonstration of his newest weapon, a steam-powered tank, and angers McGrath by using his soldiers for target practice. Accusing McGrath of \"betrayal\" for surrendering at Appomattox Court House, Loveless shoots him and leaves him for dead. Gordon, West, and Rita find the dying McGrath, who reveals he was framed by Loveless for the massacre. The three catch up with Loveless on The Wanderer. After a brief fight, Rita accidentally releases sleeping gas, which knocks out West, Gordon and herself. Wild West Gold and Gordon wake up as Loveless pulls away in The Wanderer, taking Rita hostage. Announcing his intention to capture President Grant at the golden spike ceremony, he leaves the duo in a deadly trap from which they narrowly escape. West and Gordon stumble across Loveless's private railroad, leading to his secret industrial complex at Spider Canyon where they witness Loveless's ultimate weapon, a gigantic mechanical spider armed with nitroglycerin cannons. Loveless uses his spider to capture Grant and Gordon at the ceremony while West is shot and left for dead by one of Loveless's henchwomen after being caught sneaking in the spider. At his complex, Loveless announces his plan \u2013 to dissolve the United States, dividing the territory among Great Britain, France, Spain, Mexico, the Native American people and Loveless himself, but Grant refuses to surrender and Loveless orders Gordon to be executed. However, West \u2013 having survived being shot earlier \u2013 disguises himself as a belly dancer and distracts Loveless, allowing Gordon to free the captives. Loveless then escapes on his spider, taking Grant with him. He again demands that Grant accept his terms of surrender, but Grant continues to reject his ultimatum and Loveless retaliates by destroying a small town. Using an \"Air Gordon\" flying machine, Gordon and West catch up to the spider where West battles Loveless's henchmen before confronting Loveless himself, now on mechanical legs. After freeing Grant, Gordon shoots one of Loveless's legs, allowing West to gain the upper hand. As the mechanical spider approaches a cliff, Loveless shoots at West with the concealed gun he used to kill McGrath, but instead hits the spider's machinery, halting it abruptly at the canyon's edge. Both West and Loveless fall from the spider, but West survives by catching a chain dangling from the machinery. Grant promotes Gordon and West as the first agents of his new United States Secret Service. After Grant departs on The Wanderer, West and Gordon reunite with Rita, whom they both attempt to court, but she announces that Professor Escobar is actually her husband. Gordon and West ride into the sunset on the spider."

However, Donner and Gibson left the project to work on a film adaptation of Maverick in 1994. Nonetheless, the project continued in the development stage with Tom Cruise rumored for the lead in 1995.  Cruise instead starred in a film adaptation of Mission: Impossible the following year. Discussions with Will Smith and director Barry Sonnenfeld began in February 1997. Warner Bros. pursued George Clooney to co-star as Artemus Gordon, with Kevin Kline, Matthew McConaughey, and Johnny Depp also in contention for the role while screenwriters S. S. Wilson and Brent Maddock (best known for writing the Short Circuit and Tremors films) were hired by the studio to script the film in April and May 1997. Clooney signed on the following August after dropping out of Jack Frost while the Wilson-Maddock script was rewritten by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (of Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Doc Hollywood fame). Principal photography was expected to begin in January 1998, but was pushed to April 22, 1998. In December 1997, Clooney dropped out after an argument with Sonnenfeld: \"Ultimately, we all decided that rather than damage this project trying to retrofit the role for me, it was better to step aside and let them get someone else.\""

        "content": "The film featured several significant changes from the television series. For example, Dr. Loveless \u2013 as portrayed by Kenneth Branagh in the film \u2013 went from a dwarf to a man without legs who uses a steam-powered wheelchair (similar to that employed by the villain in the episode \"The Night of the Brain\"); his first name was also changed from Miguelito to Arliss and was given the motive of a Southerner who sought the defeat of the North after the Civil War. Kevin Kline plays Gordon, whose character was similar to the original version portrayed by Ross Martin except that he was much more competitive with Jim West, besides being much more egotistical. The film's script had Kline's Gordon create more ridiculous, humorous, and implausible inventions than those created by Martin's Gordon in the television series, as well as having an aggressive rivalry with West, whereas in the television series, West and he  had a very close friendship and trusted each other with their lives. While Gordon did indeed impersonate Grant in the series (\"The Night of the Steel Assassin\", \"The Night of the Colonel's Ghost\", and \"The Night of the Big Blackmail\"), they were not played by the same actor. Additionally, on the TV series, West was portrayed by Robert Conrad, a Caucasian rather than an African American \u2013 which serves a critical plot point as West's parents were among the victims of Loveless's massacre at New Liberty. Jon Peters produced the film alongside director Sonnenfeld. In a 2002 Q&A event that appears on An Evening with Kevin Smith, filmmaker Kevin Smith talked about working with Peters on a fifth potential Superman film in 1997, revealing that Peters had three demands for the script. The first demand was that Superman not wear the suit, the second was that Superman not fly, and the third was to have Superman fight a giant spider in the third act. After Tim Burton came on board, Smith's script was scrapped and the film was never produced due to further complications. A year later, he noted that Wild Wild West, with Peters on board as producer, was released with the inclusion of a giant mechanical spider in the final act. Neil Gaiman also said that Peters insisted that a giant mechanical spider be included in a proposed film adaptation of The Sandman."

The Wanderer is portrayed by the Baltimore & Ohio 4\u20134\u20130 No. 25, one of the oldest operating steam locomotives in the U.S. Built in 1856 at the Mason Machine Works in Taunton, Massachusetts, it was later renamed The William Mason in honor of its manufacturer. During preproduction, the engine was sent to the steam shops at the Strasburg Rail Road for restoration and repainting. The locomotive is brought out for the B&O Train Museum in Baltimore's \"Steam Days\". The William Mason and the Inyo (which was the locomotive used in the original television series) both appeared in the 1956 Disney film The Great Locomotive Chase. Much of the Wild West footage was shot around Santa Fe, New Mexico, particularly at the western town film set at the Cook Movie Ranch (now Cerro Pelon Ranch). During the shooting of a sequence involving stunts and pyrotechnics, a planned building fire grew out of control and quickly overwhelmed the local fire crews that were standing by.

The score mainly follows the Western genre's symphonic tradition, while at times also acknowledging the film's anachronistic playfulness by employing a more contemporary music style with notable rock percussion and electronic organ. The score also briefly incorporates Richard Markowitz's theme from the television series in one cue (uncredited in the film and not included on the album); ironically, this was one of the few elements to be faithful to the original television series, which also did not credit Markowitz for the theme. Additional parts of the score were composed by Bernstein's son Peter, while his daughter Emilie served as one of the orchestrators and producers. Like most of his films during this period, Will Smith recorded a hip hop song based on the film's plot, also titled \"Wild Wild West\". \"Wild Wild West\" was a number-one hit on the U.S. pop charts, but it also won a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song. It was produced by Rob Fusari, who lifted a sample from Stevie Wonder's 1976 hit \"I Wish\". The song also features guest vocals from R&B group Dru Hill, and was a star-making vehicle for Dru Hill lead singer Sisq\u00f3. Old-school rapper Kool Moe Dee had recorded a \"Wild Wild West\" single of his own in 1987, to which he re-performs the chorus from his old \"Wild Wild West\" as the chorus of this new \"Wild Wild West\". A performance of the song by Smith, Dee, Dru Hill, and Sisqo at the 1999 MTV Movie Awards included Wonder performing a reprise of the chorus on piano."

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times gave the film one star out of four, stating, \"Wild Wild West is a comedy dead zone. You stare in disbelief as scenes flop and die. The movie is all concept and no content; the elaborate special effects are like watching money burn on the screen.\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times gave the film a negative review, saying the film \"leaves reality so far behind that its storytelling would be arbitrary even by comic-book standards, and its characters share no common ground or emotional connection.\""

Ralston helped create the original television series The Wild Wild West and scripted the pilot episode \"The Night of the Inferno\". In a deposition, Ralston explained that in 1964, he had been approached by producer Michael Garrison, who \"said he had an idea for a series, good commercial idea, and wanted to know if I could glue the idea of a Western hero and a James Bond type together in the same show\". Ralston said he then created the Civil War characters, the format, the story outline and nine drafts of the script that were the basis for the television series. It was his idea, for example, to have a secret agent named Jim West who would perform secret missions for a bumbling President Grant. Ralston's experience brought to light a common Hollywood practice of the 1950s and 1960s when television writers who helped create popular series allowed producers or studios to take credit for a show, thus cheating the writers out of millions of dollars in royalties. However, Ralston died in 1999 before his suit was settled, resulting in Warner Bros. paying his family between $600,000 and $1.5\u00a0million."

The serial was first broadcast in four weekly episodes from 5 to 26 October 1988. It was written by Ben Aaronovitch and directed by Andrew Morgan. In the serial, alien time traveller the Doctor (Sylvester McCoy) and his companion Ace (Sophie Aldred) travel back to 1963 to retrieve the Hand of Omega, a powerful device created by the Doctor's Time Lord race, and keep it from the Daleks. The serial contains many references to the history of the show, featuring settings from the first Doctor Who episode, An Unearthly Child, such as Coal Hill School and the junkyard at 76 Totter's Lane. In a variety of reader polls conducted by Doctor Who Magazine from 1998 onwards, Remembrance of the Daleks has consistently been voted as one of the greatest Doctor Who stories of all time. The serial marks the final appearance of the Daleks in the original run."

        "content": "The Seventh Doctor and Ace arrive in Shoreditch in 1963. They meet a military unit led by Group Captain Gilmore and Sergeant Smith, tracking abnormal local magnetic fluctuations, originating mainly from Coal Hill School where a transmat device in its basement is tied to a Dalek ship in geostationary orbit. A second, weaker fluctuation is emitted by a grey Dalek in a nearby junkyard. Evidently, two Dalek factions are present: the Imperial Daleks on the orbiting mothership, controlling the school, and Renegade Daleks, who reject the Emperor's authority, controlling the junkyard. Both sides seek the Hand of Omega, a Time Lord device the Doctor left on Earth during his first visit to 1963. Smith is a secret associate of Ratcliffe, the leader of a group of fascists, reporting to a Renegade battle computer, which also uses a schoolgirl as its eyes and ears. The Doctor has the Hand buried in a local cemetery as a ruse, but it is soon unearthed by Ratcliffe, tipped off by Smith. Imperial Daleks arrive to seize it from the Renegades, but the Doctor and Ace defeat them and destroy their transmat. Anticipating a siege, the Doctor has Gilmore fortify the school while he disables the Renegade \"time controller\", leaving his calling card and fleeing with Daleks in pursuit, returning to the school just as the Imperial Daleks land. After losing the initial battles, the Imperials eventually defeat the Renegades after deploying a Special Weapons Dalek, wiping out all but a Supreme Dalek, allowing Ratcliffe and Smith to escape with the controller, pursued by the schoolgirl, who kills Ratcliffe. The Imperial Daleks take the Hand to the mothership, leaving for their home planet, Skaro. Ace follows Smith to recover the controller. The Doctor establishes communication with the Dalek Emperor, who is really their creator, Davros, who means to destroy the Time Lords with the Hand. The Doctor mocks him but then feigns fear. Davros launches the Hand, Skaro's sun goes supernova, and Skaro is destroyed, the force of the explosion also wrecking the mothership. The Hand returns to Gallifrey. Smith captures and attempts to kill Ace, but the schoolgirl finds them and kills Smith first. The Doctor persuades the Supreme Dalek to relinquish control of the girl, as, with Skaro gone, so is its purpose. The Supreme self-destructs, and the girl screams and faints, but is unharmed. At Smith's funeral, Ace asks the Doctor if what they have done was good, to which he responds: \"Time will tell\"."

        "content": "Producer John Nathan-Turner wanted to start Doctor Who twenty-fifth anniversary season \"with a bang\" by doing a story with the Doctor's most famous adversaries, the Daleks. Nathan-Turner and script editor Andrew Cartmel hired Ben Aaronovitch to write the story; Aaronovitch, who had not written for television before, was ecstatic. Aaronovitch was 25 years old at the time, and had been recommended to Cartmel by fellow BBC script editor Caroline Oulton. He initially developed a story idea which later became Battlefield (1989), before Cartmel then commissioned Aaronovitch to write the Dalek story, originally titled Nemesis of the Doctor. According to deals made with Terry Nation, the creator of the Daleks, the script for a Dalek story had to be approved by Nation if he was not writing it. Despite initial concerns, the storyline was approved. One of Cartmel's goals with the story was to have the Doctor be a commanding centre, rather than being \"pushed and pulled\" by the story as he felt had been happening recently. As such, Aaronovitch wanted there to be a spirit of the Doctor just wanting to tackle the Daleks. Two of the first things Aaronovitch thought of when creating the story was the 1963 setting and a Dalek climbing up stairs. He decided to reveal the Daleks in the middle of the first episode instead of as its cliffhanger, and then have the latter be a Dalek levitating up stairs to surprise viewers. The inability of Daleks to climb stairs was an urban myth and a joke, with the Doctor even joking about it in Destiny of the Daleks (1979). Remembrance was intended to put it to rest, though Cartmel noted that the joke was still prevalent. The Dalek civil war seen in Remembrance was intended to be an outcome of the previous Dalek story, Revelation of the Daleks (1985). Aaronovitch felt that destroying Skaro at the end seemed like a logical conclusion, but he noted that it might not be the best decision in the long run. Remembrance of the Daleks, the first story in Doctor Who twenty-fifth anniversary season, contains many intentional references to the series' past, something Aaronovitch felt was fun. The story is set in the same time and place as the programme's first episode, \"An Unearthly Child\", where Coal Hill School employed original companions Ian and Barbara and the Doctor's granddaughter Susan was enrolled. The Totter's Lane junkyard also reappears, as it had in season 22's Attack of the Cybermen, though \"I.M. Foreman\" is misspelled \"I.M. Forman\". It originally read \"L.M.\", though that was changeable in production. In one of the classrooms, Ace picks up a book on the French Revolution just as Susan had in \"An Unearthly Child\"; Aldred studied the original to try to mimic Carole Ann Ford's stature. The Doctor references the events of The Dalek Invasion of Earth (1964), Genesis of the Daleks (1975), Terror of the Zygons (1975), and The Web of Fear (1968), as well as likening a device to something he used in Planet of the Daleks (1973). The Doctor mistakenly calls Captain Gilmore \"Brigadier\", a reference to the character Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, who headed UNIT, an organization similar to Gilmore's. Rachel, a scientific advisor from Cambridge, is similar to Liz Shaw, and she shares a conversation with Gilmore that is reminiscent of a conversation between the Brigadier and Liz in Spearhead from Space (1970). Rachel also bears a physical resemblance to Barbara. Remembrance of the Daleks is also notable for containing a meta-reference; a television continuity announcer says, \"This is BBC television, the time is quarter past five and Saturday viewing continues with an adventure in the new science fiction series Doc\u2014\", but is cut off by a scene change before completing the title. Aaronovitch \"couldn't resist\" the reference, and clarified that it was meant as a joke and was not to be taken seriously. Originally, it was intended that the show that was introduced would be called Professor X. In addition, Alison and Rachel make mention of a \"Bernard\" from the \"British Rocket Group\". This is a reference to Bernard Quatermass and his British Experimental Rocket Group, of the Nigel Kneale-penned Quatermass science-fiction television serials. Several scenes from Remembrance of the Daleks were cut or edited in production. McCoy's favourite scene, in which the Doctor muses to a worker at a caf\u00e9, was cut down by about half. As originally shot, Ace defused the tension between her and the Doctor when he left her at the boarding house. Also cut was the Doctor curing Ace's leg at the beginning of the third episode, and the issuing of instructions from the Dalek controller through an earpiece. A notable deleted line is the Doctor telling Davros that he is \"far more than just another Time Lord\". This, along with the Doctor's hints that he was present at the creation of the Hand of Omega, was part of the so-called \"Cartmel Masterplan\" by script editor Andrew Cartmel to restore some of the mystery to the Doctor's origins. However, as the programme ceased production in 1989, the intended revelations never came to pass. The original script also had the Doctor blowing up a Dalek with the anti-tank missile in episode two, but McCoy felt this was out of character and suggested Ace should do it instead."

        "content": "To protect the secret of Davros' presence in the story, Terry Molloy was credited in part three under an anagram, \"Roy Tromelly\". Ian Ogilvy was approached for the role of Gilmore, but did not accept; Neil Stacy was also considered. The role went to Simon Williams, who was known for his role as James Bellamy in Upstairs, Downstairs. Sophie Aldred and Karen Gledhil, who had watched the programme when they were younger, were awed to work with him. Williams had trouble handling the character's gun and also misunderstood a stage direction in the script describing it, which earned him the nickname of \"Chunky\". This nickname was carried on into the character, with McCoy adding the line, \"...why his men call him 'Chunky' I've no idea.\" The computer was voiced by John Leeson, who previously played the Doctor's robot dog companion K-9. Leeson was asked to make his voice sound like Davros', to trick viewers into thinking the computer was Davros, and watched past episodes for reference. Michael Sheard was chosen to play the headmaster as he would be familiar to children. Sheard had to be released from his work on Grange Hill to participate; Peter Tilbury was briefly considered for the role if Sheard could not make it. Sheard had previously appeared in The Ark (1966), The Mind of Evil (1971), Pyramids of Mars (1975), The Invisible Enemy (1977), and Castrovalva (1982). Peter Halliday, who played the blind Vicar, had also appeared in various Doctor Who stories. Stratford Johns, who had previously appeared in Four to Doomsday, was originally considered for Ratcliffe. Mark McGann, the brother of Eighth Doctor actor Paul McGann, was originally considered for the role of Mike Smith. Pamela Salem had roles in two Fourth Doctor serials, as one of the Xoanon voices in The Face of Evil, and as Toos in The Robots of Death (1977). Simon Williams, Karen Gledhill and Pamela Salem reprised their roles in this serial in an audio spin-off series for Big Finish titled Counter-Measures, which details the adventures of the group after this story. Remembrance of the Daleks was also the first story in which Aldred's Ace was a regular companion, having joined at the end of Dragonfire. Cartmel worked with Aldred to make Ace different from most companions: less of a \"screamer\" and more tomboyish. Aldred recalled that taking on the Daleks made her feel like a \"real assistant\". Aldred did many of her own stunts, bonding with the new stunt coordinator, Tip Tipping. She found the experience \"terrifying\" at first. Aldred has said that she is proud of the scene where Ace beats up a Dalek with a baseball bat, calling it one of the best things she has done in her life. Aldred was also trained in firing guns for the scene where she shoots a Dalek."

        "content": "The director, Andrew Morgan, wanted to improve upon his last effort, Time and the Rani (1987). Feeling that the script was worth it, extra money was put into the production. However, production on the serial went over-budget by \u00a313,000, and as a result Morgan was barred from directing for the programme again. Filming took place in April 1988. St John's School in Hammersmith was used as Coal Hill School. The Kew Bridge Steam Museum in Brentford was used as the I.M. Forman junkyard. Filming at this location was occasionally interrupted by a radio traffic news helicopter circling overhead. John Nodes Funeral Service in Ladbroke Grove, London was used for the funeral parlour the Doctor retrieves the Hand of Omega from, and the graveyard where he buries the Hand is Willesden Lane Cemetery. The cemetery filming was attended by some Doctor Who fans who came to watch. For the levitating Dalek, a scaffolding was built over the stairs, and the Dalek prop was placed in a tray that was hoisted up by a rail-mounted trolley. Two of the six Renegade Daleks were reused props from the 1960s. The Imperial Daleks were built with bigger wheels that would roll easier on location. Aaronovitch expected the Dalek ship to be cheap-looking and achieved with colour-separation overlay, and was surprised when a model ship was constructed and \"landed\" with the help of a crane. For the final battle sequence between the Renegade and Imperial Daleks, the BBC Effects Department's pyrotechnics were so loud and the explosions so realistic that the London Fire Brigade was dispatched to the scene by local residents who feared that an IRA bomb had gone off. McCoy recalled that after the first explosions, a number of car alarms in the neighborhood went off, and the emergency services drivers were surprised when they arrived to see Daleks coming at them from out of the smoke. The junkyard gate was part of ITV's storage facility, and the pyrotechnics not only destroyed it for the effect of the Special Weapons Dalek blowing it up, but also smashed windows in the nearby building. A thermal imaging camera was used for Dalek perspective shots."

He also noted that the many continuity references in the story displayed a knowledge of the series' history, but that Remembrance of the Daleks was \"neither a celebration of the Doctor Who legacy\" like The Five Doctors (1983), \"nor an exercise in fan-obsessive continuity\" as was displayed in Attack of the Cybermen (1985). The battle between the factions of Daleks has been likened to racism, which is apparent in the 1960s setting as Ace sees a sign that says \"No Coloureds\". The subtext was intentional, as Aaronovitch drew on the Daleks' Nazi theme and applied it to the setting. Cartmel was particularly proud of the scene and, when it was screened to BBC Head of Drama Mark Shivas, rewound the tape because Shivas had missed the sequence due to a phone call. Shivas felt that Ace should have torn the sign up, and Cartmel agreed it was a missed opportunity."

Retrospective reviews have been mostly positive. Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote in The Discontinuity Guide, \"The best Doctor Who story in some considerable time, Remembrance of the Daleks reintroduced mystery and magic into the series with much intelligence and revisionist continuity\". The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn, despite noting that the production had not aged well visually, called Remembrance of the Daleks \"the Seventh Doctor era at its best\". He was positive towards how going back to An Unearthly Child allowed Aaronovitch and Cartmel to \"showcase their new, more devious master-planner version of the Doctor\", as well as the action and the character moments for Ace. DVD Talk's J. Doyle Wallis, reviewing the original DVD release, gave the story three and a half out of five stars, calling it \"a good ... adventure\" and noting the shift in the Doctor's personality. Alasdair Wilkins of io9 called Remembrance \"by a pretty wide margin the best anniversary special the show has ever done\", praising the return to the 1960s and the various continuity references. Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times praised the serial for \"attempting to honour the programme's roots, even if, sadly, the effect is more of the present clomping all over the past\", and questioned how the Doctor could have known about the Daleks in 1963 if he did not meet them until he left. He was also critical of the supporting characters and McCoy and Ace; he felt McCoy \"struggles to convey gravitas\" in the changes that had been made to his character, and while Aldred brought \"gusto\", Ace was \"a peculiarly safe, middle-class rendering of a streetwise kid\". Mulkern wrote that the action scenes were handled well, but some of the Daleks looked \"fragile\" and destroying Skaro was double genocide. John Sinnot, reviewing the second DVD release on DVD Talk, also gave the serial three and a half out of five stars. He praised the action, references, and the Doctor's active involvement in the plot, but criticised the music and also questioned how the Doctor would have been able to plant the Hand of Omega for the Daleks. Sinnot also felt the Daleks acted \"stupid\" in some scenes, and wrote that the relationship between Ace and Mike was \"clumsy and awkward\". In 2010, Charlie Jane Anders of io9 listed the cliffhanger to the first episode \u2013 in which the Dalek levitates up the stairs \u2013 as one of the greatest cliffhangers in the history of Doctor Who. However, Anders felt that the execution was \"pants, with Sylvester McCoy pulling some dreadful faces\". In 2013, Den of Geeks Andrew Blair selected Remembrance of the Daleks as one of the ten Doctor Who stories that would make great musicals. In the Doctor Who Magazine season poll for 1988, Remembrance of the Daleks was voted as the best story of season twenty-five with 64% of the vote, 46% ahead of runner-up The Greatest Show in the Galaxy. Ten years later, the magazine conducted a poll of readers to find the most popular Doctor Who stories of all time for the programme's 35th anniversary; Remembrance of the Daleks was voted in 6th position. In 2003, the magazine conducted a similar poll for the programme's 40th anniversary \u2013 this time, Remembrance of the Daleks finished in 7th place. Remembrance of the Daleks was placed in 14th position in the magazine's \"Mighty 200\" reader survey in 2009, which ranked all of the 200 Doctor Who stories made up to that point in order of preference.

Its use of a \"darker Doctor and more modern approach\" has been seen as influencing the Virgin New Adventures, a series of more adult original novels that continued the Doctor Who story after the series was canceled. It is here that the ancient Gallifreyan figure known as \"The Other\" first appears, who had been instrumental to the Cartmel Masterplan, and whose storyline continued into the New Adventures. The novelisation also references Kadiatu Lethbridge-Stewart, who became a recurring character in the New Adventures. Certain phrases are also translated into the Daleks' language and it is established that they refer to the Doctor as the \"Ka Faraq Gatri\", which is variously translated as \"Bringer of Darkness\" or \"Destroyer of Worlds\". The phrase is used throughout the Virgin New Adventures series to refer to the increasingly dark actions of the Seventh Doctor and is referred to again in \"Journey's End\" where Davros condemns the Tenth Doctor as the \"Destroyer of Worlds\".

It was re-released in 2001 as part of The Davros Collection, which was a limited-edition box set, exclusive to UK retailer WH Smith. The serial was released on DVD in the United Kingdom on 26 February 2001, remastered by the Doctor Who Restoration Team. The original Region 2 DVD release has some video effects missing from episode 1 and the start of episode 2. This was an unforeseen consequence of the Restoration Team using earlier edits of these episodes to minimize generational quality loss, made before certain effects were added. The problem was corrected with subsequent DVD releases, including Region 1. This DVD also was not able to include two songs by The Beatles, \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" and \"A Taste of Honey\", due to copyright; the former was replaced by the Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas version of the same song, while the latter was replaced with \"generic production music\". The story was included as part of a limited run box set in 2003 with The Dalek Invasion of Earth and Resurrection of the Daleks. A remastered version of this story was released on Region 2 in November 2007, as part of The Complete Davros Collection and as a two-disc standalone release (including the 'Davros Connections' documentary from the boxset) on 20 July 2009. It includes the effects that were mistakenly left out and songs by The Beatles that weren't clearable for the original release but subsequently fell under a blanket music licensing agreement for the UK. There is also a newly remastered stereo and 5.1 surround sound mix. In the original Davros Boxset release version, there were two total mutes of the 5.1 soundtrack during episode one. 2entertain fixed the master within a few days of release and faulty copies could be exchanged for fixed ones via mail-in. The standalone version of the release uses the fixed version. The two-disc Special Edition was delayed due to clearance issues and was held off until it was released in the United States and Canada on 2 March 2010. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in issue 29 on 10 February 2010, the first of the classic series to be released on the partwork. This marks the fourth different separate release of the serial on DVD. In 2013 it was released on DVD for another time as part of the \"Doctor Who: The Doctors Revisited 5-8\" box set, alongside Earthshock, Vengeance on Varos, and the TV Movie. Alongside a documentary on the Seventh Doctor, the disc features the serial put together as a single feature in widescreen format with an introduction from then current show runner Steven Moffat, as well as its original version."

        "content": "Prince Edward of Euphrania returns home after meeting the princess Selena of Carolsveld, whom his parents have arranged for him to marry. However, The Prince did not propose to the princess, and angrily denounces arranged marriages (\"Why Can't I Be Two People?\").   Edward prefers to marry for love while his parents want a political alliance (\"What Has Love Got to Do with Being Married?\"). Meanwhile, Cinderella's cruel stepmother has banished her to the cellar, and forces her to work as a servant to her and her two vindictive daughters, Isobella and Palatine. Cinderella finds some comfort in remembering happier times (\"Once I Was Loved\"). Whilst putting flowers by her parents' grave, she inadvertently stumbles upon the prince, and his friend and bodyguard John, who are visiting the Royal crypt. The Prince sardonically talks about his dead ancestors, with whom he will one day be buried (\"What a Comforting Thing to Know\"). Back at the castle, the King of Euphrania is advised that a marriage between Edward and a Princess from one of Euphrania's neighboring countries (and thus potential enemies) would help prevent war. A ball is seen as the perfect way to help Edward choose his bride (\"Protocolligorically Correct\"). The Prince hates the idea, though his cousin Montague is delighted (\"Bride-finding Ball\"). When news arrives that Carolsveld intends to make war on Euphrania, Edward has no choice but to accept. However, fewer than half the princesses accept the invitation, so the local nobility, including Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters, are invited. Because of the lack of dresses at the dressmakers, the stepmother and stepsisters demand that Cinderella sew all three of them elegant gowns for the ball from the fabric of their old dresses. Cinderella has no idea what to do. As luck would have it a fairy godmother, who has a talent for sensing the wishes of those who are pure in heart, arrives and creates three beautiful gowns while Cinderella rests. That night, the stepmother and stepsisters depart for the ball leaving Cinderella alone. Cinderella's fairy godmother returns and informs Cinderella that she too can go to the ball. She transforms Cinderella's shabby dress into a lovely gown, arranges her hair in the period fashion, and a coach and horses are magically prepared. Cinderella is sent off to the ball with a warning that the magic can only last until midnight (\"Suddenly It Happens\"). It is love at first sight when Cinderella and Edward meet at the ball (\"Secret Kingdom\"). As the clock strikes midnight, Cinderella races away, leaving behind only her glass slipper (\"He / She Danced With Me\"). Edward sends his servants out far and wide in search of the woman who fits the glass slipper. The search turns out empty-handed. Edward builds a monument for the slipper and hopes that one day his lost love will turn up. John is also suffering as a result of love: he is in love with a noblewoman, but his position forbids them to be together (\"Position and Positioning\"). Edward knights John, so John can pursue his romance with Lady Caroline. Finally, frustrated by his fruitless search, Edward breaks the monument, tossing the slipper into the woods where Cinderella finds and starts to dance with it, which catches John's attention and he rushes off to inform the Prince. Cinderella and Edward are reunited and greeted by her stepmother and stepsisters. Edward asks the permission of the stepmother to marry Cinderella and she gives full permission, if only to get Cinderella off her hands. Cinderella tells her stepmother and stepsisters that she forgives them for their abuse. In the throne room, Edward and Cinderella go before the King and Queen. Whilst the King and Queen find Cinderella to be charming, something seems to be troubling the King. He takes the Lord Chamberlain aside and tells him that there is no way his son and Cinderella, a non-royal, can be married. The Lord Chamberlain conveys this to Cinderella, explaining also that a military alliance through marriage must be established with one of the neighboring kingdoms to protect them against war and to secure the safety and future existence of Euphrania. Along with this disheartening news, it is also explained that she will have to be exiled that very night. Brokenhearted, Cinderella asks the Lord Chamberlain to tell Edward that she never loved him, because she knows that Edward will try to find her because of his love for her (\"Tell Him\"). Edward, knowing he's fighting a losing battle, agrees to marry whomever the King and Queen choose, but says that his marital duties will go no further than the altar. Cinderella, living peacefully in exile, still thinks of Edward (\"I Can't Forget the Melody\"). Her fairy godmother arrives and asks Cinderella why she isn't at the castle as Edward is getting married that day. Cinderella, surprised, asks who Edward is marrying. The fairy godmother doesn't know, as it's most certainly the wrong woman, but plans to set things right\u2014again. Back at the castle, as the wedding is taking place, everyone is surprised when Cinderella shows up in a wedding gown. The King interrupts the wedding and he and his council meet in private. The fairy godmother joins the discussion and convinces the king to change the law, so that Edward can marry the girl of his choice. In a surprising twist, Edward's cousin and the chosen bride fall in love at first sight, and marry, thus fulfilling the alliance after all. Cinderella and Edward live happily ever after."

It should earn some grown-up gratitude because it demonstrates that family fare does not have to be childish ... The defects are not such as to dent seriously the satisfaction of having so stylish and good-hearted a movie around. But it really is a familiar trip, however luxurious the vehicle, and the last 20 minutes or so seem very long and slow indeed.\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote that the film \"won't be remembered as one of the great musicals, but it's more diverting than I supposed,\" further noting that the script \"does have agreeable outbursts of silliness and fancy. Michael Hordern as the worried, abstracted king and Annette Crosbie as Cinderella's brisk, humorous fairy godmother are consistently delightful.\" Brenda Davies of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, \"The songs are not very memorable but they are enjoyable and appropriate in their context; the choreography too fits neatly into the plot but is not in itself particularly imaginative. But these shortcomings are abundantly outweighed by the wit and zest of both writing and playing.\""

This release features monaural sound and a 1.33:1 pan and scanned transfer of the shorter US release with the songs \"What Has Love Got to Do with Being Married\" and \"I Can't Forget the Melody\" omitted. As it was never put out on VHS by MCA, the MCA Laserdisc was the only US video release of any kind prior to 2000, likely due to Universal's distribution rights lapsing and having reverted to production company Paradine. In the UK and Australia, where it was more successful, it spanned several VHS releases by the likes of Video Gems and CEL Home Video respectively. These releases feature the full length UK theatrical version, which includes the songs \"What Has Love Got to Do with Being Married\" and \"I Can't Forget the Melody\" that were cut from the US release. In 2000, independent distributor Castle Hill (who had acquired US distribution rights in the mid 1990s) licensed the film to Image Entertainment for a US VHS and DVD release in its full length UK theatrical version. Extras on the DVD version include a video interview with the Sherman Brothers, an audio commentary by director Bryan Forbes, and a promotional featurette. This release is long out of print and was highly sought after prior to 2013. On 19 November 2013, the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by Inception Media Group, under licence from Castle Hill successor Westchester Films. This release utilizes a new 4K restoration of the UK theatrical version performed by Pinewood and a PCM 2.0 mix of the 4-Track Stereo, a 5.1 DTS Master Audio remix, and the isolated score in DTS-MA 5.1. In addition to porting over all the extras and the audio commentary from the Image Entertainment DVD, the only new supplement is the UK theatrical trailer mastered from a 35mm element. The film has also received overseas Blu-Ray releases from Second Sight in the UK and Orustak Pictures in Japan, both utilizing the Pinewood 4K restoration and most extras from the Inception release. On 5 February 2019, Shout Factory (who had purchased Westchester Films in 2017 and reincorporated their titles under the Shout Factory branding) reissued the film on DVD and Blu-Ray. This reissue is almost identical to the prior Inception Media Group release utilizing the same Pinewood restoration and supplements, only down to video encoding differences and the 2.0 stereo track being DTS Master Audio."

        "content": "The Nightmare Before Christmas (also known as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas) is a 1993 American stop-motion animated musical dark fantasy film directed by Henry Selick (in his feature directorial debut) and produced and conceived by Tim Burton. It tells the story of Jack Skellington, the King of \"Halloween Town\" who stumbles upon \"Christmas Town\" and becomes obsessed with celebrating the holiday. Danny Elfman wrote the songs and score, and provided the singing voice of Jack. The principal voice cast also includes Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, William Hickey, Ken Page, Paul Reubens, Glenn Shadix, and Ed Ivory. The Nightmare Before Christmas originated in a poem written by Burton in 1982 while he was working as an animator at Walt Disney Productions. With the success of Vincent in the same year, Burton began to consider developing The Nightmare Before Christmas as either a short film or 30-minute television special to no avail. Over the years, Burton's thoughts regularly returned to the project and in 1990, he made a development deal with Walt Disney Studios. Production started in July 1991 in San Francisco; Disney initially released the film through Touchstone Pictures because the studio believed the film would be \"too dark and scary for kids\". The film met with both critical and financial success, earning praise for its animation (particularly the innovation of the stop-motion art form), characters, songs and score. It has grossed $91.5 million worldwide since its initial release and garnered a cult following. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, a first for an animated film. The film has since been reissued by Walt Disney Pictures, and was re-released annually in Disney Digital 3-D from 2006 until 2010."

        "content": "Halloween Town is a fantasy world populated by various monsters and beings associated with the holiday. Jack Skellington, respected by the citizens as the \"Pumpkin King\", leads them in organizing the annual Halloween celebrations. However, this year, Jack has grown tired of the same annual routine and wants something new. Wandering in the woods the next morning, he encounters six trees containing doors leading to other holiday-themed worlds and stumbles into the one leading to Christmas Town. Awed by the unfamiliar holiday, Jack returns home to show his friends and neighbors his findings, but unaware of the idea of Christmas, they compare everything to their ideas of Halloween. However, they do relate to one Christmas Town character: its ruler, Santa Claus, or \"Sandy Claws\" as Jack mistakenly calls him. Jack sequesters himself in his house to study Christmas further and find a way to rationally explain it. After studying and experimentation accomplish nothing, Jack ultimately decides that Christmas should be improved rather than understood and announces that Halloween Town will take over Christmas this year. Jack assigns the residents many Christmas-themed jobs, including singing carols, making presents, and building a sleigh pulled by skeletal reindeer. Sally, the feminine creation of local mad scientist Doctor Finklestein who secretly loves Jack, experiences a vision detailing that their efforts will end disastrously, but Jack dismisses this and assigns her the task of making him a Santa Claus suit. He also tasks mischievous trick-or-treating trio Lock, Shock and Barrel to abduct Santa and bring him to Halloween Town. Jack tells Santa he will be handling Christmas in his place this year and orders the trio to keep Santa safe, but against his wishes, they instead deliver Santa to Jack's long-time rival, Oogie Boogie, a bogeyman who has a passion for gambling and plots to play a game with Santa's life at stake. Sally attempts to rescue Santa to save both him and Jack from their potential fates, but she is captured as well. Jack departs to deliver his presents in the real world, but they instead frighten the populace, who contact the authorities and are instructed by them to lock down their homes and residences for protection. When word spreads about Jack's presumed wrongdoings, he is ultimately shot down by military forces, causing him to crash in a cemetery. While all of Halloween Town sadly believe him to be dead, Jack actually survived. As he bemoans the disaster he has caused, he finds he enjoyed the experience nonetheless, reigniting his love of Halloween, but soon realizes he must act fast to fix his mess. Jack returns home and infiltrates Oogie's lair, rescuing Santa and Sally before confronting Oogie and defeating him by unraveling a thread holding his cloth form together, causing all the bugs inside him to spill out and reduce him to nothing. Jack apologizes to Santa for his actions, to which he, despite being furious at Jack for the trouble he caused and ignoring Sally's forewarnings, assures him that he can still save Christmas. As Santa replaces Jack's presents with genuine ones, all of Halloween Town celebrates Jack's survival and return. Santa then shows Jack that there are no hard feelings between them by bringing a snowfall to the town, which fulfills Jack's original dream in a way and causes the residents to finally realize the true meaning of Christmas. Afterwards, Jack and Sally declare their love for each other."

        "content": "As writer Burton's upbringing in Burbank, California, was associated with the feeling of solitude, the filmmaker was largely fascinated by holidays during his childhood. \"Anytime there was Christmas or Halloween, [\u2026] it was great. It gave you some sort of texture all of a sudden that wasn't there before\", Burton would later recall. After completing his short film Vincent in 1982, Burton, who was then employed at Walt Disney Feature Animation, wrote a three-page poem titled The Nightmare Before Christmas, drawing inspiration from television specials of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, How the Grinch Stole Christmas! and the poem A Visit from St. Nicholas. Burton intended to adapt the poem into a television special with the narration spoken by his favorite actor, Vincent Price, but also considered other options such as a children's book. He created concept art and storyboards for the project in collaboration with Rick Heinrichs, who also sculpted character models; Burton later showed his and Heinrichs' works-in-progress to Henry Selick, also a Disney animator at the time. After the success of Vincent in 1982, Disney started to consider developing The Nightmare Before Christmas as either a short film or 30-minute holiday television special. However, the project's development eventually stalled, as its tone seemed \"too weird\" to the company. As Disney was unable to \"offer his nocturnal loners enough scope\", Burton was fired from the studio in 1984, and went on to direct the commercially successful films Beetlejuice and Batman for Warner Bros. Pictures. Over the years, Burton regularly thought about the project. In 1990, Burton found out that Disney still owned the film rights. He and Selick committed to produce a full-length film with the latter as director. Burton's own success with live-action films piqued the interest of Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, who saw the film as an opportunity to continue the studio's streak of recent successes in feature animation. Disney was looking forward to Nightmare \"to show capabilities of technical and storytelling achievements that were present in Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\" Walt Disney Pictures president David Hoberman believed the film would prove to be a creative achievement for Disney's image, elaborating \"we can think outside the envelope. We can do different and unusual things.\" Nightmare marked Burton's third consecutive film with a Christmas setting. Burton could not direct because of his commitment to Batman Returns, and he did not want to be involved with \"the painstakingly slow process of stop motion\". To adapt his poem into a screenplay, Burton approached Michael McDowell, his collaborator on Beetlejuice. McDowell and Burton experienced creative differences, which convinced Burton to make the film as a musical with lyrics and compositions by frequent collaborator Danny Elfman. Elfman and Burton created a rough storyline and two-thirds of the film's songs. Elfman found writing Nightmares eleven songs as \"one of the easiest jobs I've ever had. I had a lot in common with Jack Skellington.\" Caroline Thompson had yet to be hired to write the screenplay. With Thompson's screenplay, Selick stated, \"there are very few lines of dialogue that are Caroline's. She became busy on other films and we were constantly rewriting, re-configuring and developing the film visually.\""

        "content": "Selick and his team of animators began production in July 1991 in San Francisco, California with a crew of over 120 workers, utilizing 20 sound stages for filming. Joe Ranft was hired from Disney as a storyboard supervisor, while Eric Leighton was hired to supervise animation. At the peak of production, 20 individual stages were simultaneously being used for filming. In total, there were 109,440 frames taken for the film. The work of Ray Harryhausen, Ladislas Starevich, Edward Gorey, \u00c9tienne Delessert, Gahan Wilson, Charles Addams, Jan Lenica, Francis Bacon, and Wassily Kandinsky influenced the filmmakers. Selick described the production design as akin to a pop-up book. In addition, Selick stated, \"When we reach Halloween Town, it's entirely German Expressionism. When Jack enters Christmas Town, it's an outrageous Dr. Seuss-esque setpiece. Finally, when Jack is delivering presents in the 'Real World', everything is plain, simple and perfectly aligned.\" Vincent Price, Don Ameche, and James Earl Jones were considered to provide the narration for the film's prologue; however, all proved difficult to cast, and the producers instead hired local voice artist Ed Ivory. Patrick Stewart provided the prologue narration for the film's soundtrack. On the direction of the film, Selick reflected, \"It's as though he [Burton] laid the egg, and I sat on it and hatched it. He wasn't involved in a hands-on way, but his hand is in it. It was my job to make it look like 'a Tim Burton film', which is not so different from my own films.\" When asked about Burton's involvement, Selick claimed, \"I don't want to take away from Tim, but he was not in San Francisco when we made it. He came up five times over two years, and spent no more than eight or ten days in total.\" Walt Disney Feature Animation contributed with some second-layering traditional animation. Burton found production somewhat difficult because he was simultaneously filming Batman Returns and pre-production of Ed Wood. The filmmakers constructed 227 puppets to represent the characters in the movie, with Jack Skellington having \"around four hundred heads\", allowing the expression of every possible emotion.  Sally's mouth movements \"were animated through the replacement method. During the animation process, [\u2026] only Sally's face 'mask' was removed in order to preserve the order of her long, red hair. Sally had ten types of faces, each made with a series of eleven expressions (e.g. eyes open and closed, and various facial poses) and synchronized mouth movements.\" The stop-motion figurine of Jack was reused in James and the Giant Peach (also directed by Selick) as Captain Jack."

Burton explained that, \"\u2026it turned more into more of a brand-name thing, it turned into something else, which I'm not quite sure about.\" The film premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 9, 1993, and was given a limited release on October 13, 1993, before its wide theatrical release on October 29, 1993. The Nightmare Before Christmas was reissued under the Walt Disney Pictures label and re-released on October 20, 2006, with conversion to Disney Digital 3-D.

Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert gave a highly positive review for Nightmare. Ebert believed the film's visual effects were as revolutionary as Star Wars, taking into account that Nightmare was \"filled with imagination that carries us into a new world\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called it a restoration of \"originality and daring to the Halloween genre. This dazzling mix of fun and fright also explodes the notion that animation is kid stuff. \u2026 It's 74 minutes of timeless movie magic.\" James Berardinelli stated \"The Nightmare Before Christmas has something to offer just about everyone. For the kids, it's a fantasy celebrating two holidays. For the adults, it's an opportunity to experience some light entertainment while marveling at how adept Hollywood has become at these techniques. There are songs, laughs, and a little romance. In short, The Nightmare Before Christmas does what it intends to: entertain.\" Desson Thomson of The Washington Post enjoyed the film's similarities to the writings of Oscar Wilde and the Brothers Grimm, as well as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and other German Expressionist films. Michael A. Morrison discusses the influence of Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas! on the film, writing that Jack parallels the Grinch and Zero parallels Max, the Grinch's dog. Philip Nel writes that the film \"challenges the wisdom of adults through its trickster characters\", contrasting Jack as a \"good trickster\" with Oogie Boogie, whom he also compares with Seuss' Dr. Terwilliker as a bad trickster. Entertainment Weekly reports that fan reception of these characters borders on obsession, profiling Laurie and Myk Rudnick, a couple whose \"degree of obsession with [the] film is so great that \u2026 they named their son after the real-life person that a character in the film is based on.\" This enthusiasm for the characters has also been profiled as having spread beyond North America to Japan. Yvonne Tasker notes \"the complex characterization seen in The Nightmare Before Christmas\". Danny Elfman was worried the characterization of Oogie Boogie would be considered racist by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Elfman's predictions came true; however, director Henry Selick stated the character was inspired by the Betty Boop cartoon The Old Man of the Mountain. \"Cab Calloway would dance his inimitable jazz dance and sing 'Minnie the Moocher' or 'Old Man of the Mountain', and they would rotoscope him, trace him, turn him into a cartoon character, often transforming him into an animal, like a walrus,\" Selick continued. \"I think those are some of the most inventive moments in cartoon history, in no way racist, even though he was sometimes a villain. We went with Ken Page, who is a black singer, and he had no problem with it\"."

In 2009, Selick said he would do a film sequel if he and Burton could create a good story for it.

        "content": "Blowup (sometimes styled as Blow-up or Blow Up) is a 1966 mystery thriller film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni and produced by Carlo Ponti. It was Antonioni's first entirely English-language film, and stars David Hemmings as a London fashion photographer who believes he has unwittingly captured a murder on film. The film also stars Vanessa Redgrave, Sarah Miles, John Castle, Jane Birkin, Tsai Chin, Peter Bowles, and Gillian Hills, as well as 1960s model Veruschka. The film's plot was inspired by Julio Cort\u00e1zar's short story \"Las babas del diablo\" (1959). The screenplay was by Antonioni and Tonino Guerra, with English dialogue by British playwright Edward Bond. The cinematographer was Carlo di Palma. The film's non-diegetic music was scored by jazz pianist Herbie Hancock, while rock group the Yardbirds also feature. The film is set within the mod subculture of 1960s Swinging London. In the main competition section of the Cannes Film Festival, Blowup won the Palme d'Or, the festival's highest honour. The American release of the counterculture-era film with its explicit sexual content was in direct defiance of Hollywood's Production Code. Its subsequent critical and box-office success influenced the abandonment of the code in 1968 in favour of the MPAA film rating system. Blowup would inspire subsequent films, including Dario Argento's The Bird with the Crystal Plumage (1970), Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation (1974), and Brian De Palma's Blow Out (1981). In 2012, Blowup was ranked No. 144 in the Sight & Sound critics' poll of the world's greatest films."

He grows bored and walks off, leaving the models and production staff in the lurch. As he departs the studio, two teenaged girls who are aspiring models ask to speak with him, but Thomas drives off to visit at an antique shop. Wandering into Maryon Park, Thomas takes photos of two lovers. The woman, Jane, is furious at being photographed, and pursues Thomas, demands his film, and ultimately tries to snatch his camera. He refuses and photographs her as she runs away through a meadow. Thomas then meets his agent Ron for lunch, and notices a man following him and looking into his car. Back at his studio, Jane arrives, asking desperately for the film. She and Thomas have a conversation and flirt, but he deliberately hands her a different film roll. She, in turn, writes down a false telephone number and gives it to him. Thomas, curious, makes multiple zooms of the black-and-white film of Jane and her lover. They reveal Jane worriedly looking at a third person lurking in the trees with a pistol. Thomas excitedly calls Ron, claiming his impromptu photo session may have saved a man's life. Thomas is disturbed by a knock on the door, and it is the two girls again, with whom he has a romp in his studio and falls asleep. Awakening, he finds they hope he will photograph them, but he realizes there may be more to the photographs in the park. He tells them to leave, saying, \"Tomorrow! Tomorrow!\" Further examination of a blurred figure under a bush makes Thomas suspect the man in the park may have been murdered after all, during the time Thomas was arguing with the woman around the bend. As evening falls, the photographer goes back to the park and finds the body of the man, but he has not brought his camera and is scared off by the sound of a twig breaking, as if being stepped on. Thomas returns to find his studio ransacked. All the negatives and prints are gone except for one very grainy blowup of what is possibly the body. After driving into town, he sees the woman and follows her into a club where The Yardbirds, featuring both Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck on guitar and Keith Relf on vocals, are seen performing the song \"Stroll On\".  A buzz in Beck's amplifier angers him so much, he smashes his guitar on stage, then throws its neck into the crowd. A riot ensues. The photographer grabs the neck and runs out of the club before anyone can snatch it from him. Then, he has second thoughts about it, throws it on the pavement, and walks away. A passer-by picks up the neck and throws it back down, not realizing it is from Beck's guitar. Thomas never locates the elusive woman. At a drug-drenched party in a house on the Thames near central London, the photographer finds Veruschka, who had told him that she was going to Paris; when confronted, she says she is in Paris. Thomas asks Ron to come to the park as a witness, but cannot convince him of what has happened because Ron is incredibly stoned. Instead, Thomas joins the party and wakes up in the house at sunrise. He returns to the park alone, only to find that the body is gone. Befuddled, Thomas watches a mimed tennis match, is drawn into it, and picks up the imaginary ball and throws it back to the two players. While he watches the mime, the sound of the ball being played is heard and his image fades away, leaving only the grass as the film ends."

Subsequently, the short story was retitled \"Blow Up\" to connect it with the film. The life of Swinging London photographer David Bailey was also an influence. Several people were offered the role of the protagonist, including Sean Connery, who declined when Antonioni refused to show him the script, the photographer David Bailey, and Terence Stamp, who was replaced shortly before filming began after Antonioni found David Hemmings in a stage production of Dylan Thomas's Adventures in the Skin Trade. The opening mimes were filmed on the Plaza of The Economist Building in St. James's Street, London, a project by 'New Brutalists' Alison and Peter Smithson constructed between 1959 and 1964. The park scenes were at Maryon Park, Charlton, south-east London, and the park has changed little since the film, despite Antonioni painting the grass green to meet his requirements. Photographer John Cowan leased his studio at 39 Princes Place to Antonioni for much of the interior and exterior filming, and Cowan's own photographic murals are featured in the film. Other locations included Heddon Street where the album cover of David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust was later photographed, and Cheyne Walk, in Chelsea. The rock club scene featuring the Yardbirds performing \"Stroll On\" \u2013 a modified version of \"Train Kept A-Rollin'\" \u2013 was filmed at Elstree Studios, from 12 to 14 October 1966. Also in the rock club scene English broadcaster, journalist, writer Janet Street-Porter appears as a dancing extra in a silver coat and stripey trousers. Actor Ronan O'Casey claimed that the film's mysterious nature is the product of an \"unfinished\" production. In a 1999 letter to Roger Ebert, O'Casey wrote that scenes which would have \"depict[ed] the planning of the murder and its aftermath \u2013 scenes with Vanessa, Sarah Miles and Jeremy Glover, Vanessa's new young lover who plots with her to murder me \u2013 were never shot because the film went seriously over budget.\" O'Casey had previously told this story already to Der Spiegel in 1967, where he stated that Dyson Lovell played the part of the murderous lover. Two scenes in particular give credence to this theory: the first in the restaurant when the new lover's character (played by Lovell) is seen apparently tampering with Thomas' car, and the second when Glover and Redgrave are glimpsed together in a Rover 2000 (which also appears elsewhere) following Thomas' Rolls Royce."

In Playboy magazine, film critic Arthur Knight wrote that Blowup would be \"as important and seminal a film as Citizen Kane, Open City and Hiroshima, Mon Amour \u2013 perhaps even more so\". Time magazine called the film a \"far-out, uptight and vibrantly exciting picture\" that represented a \"screeching change of creative direction\" for Antonioni; the magazine predicted it would \"undoubtedly be by far the most popular movie Antonioni has ever made\". Bosley Crowther, film critic of The New York Times, called it a \"fascinating picture,\" but expressed reservations, describing the \"usual Antonioni passages of seemingly endless wanderings\" as \"redundant and long\"; nevertheless, he called Blowup a \"stunning picture \u2013 beautifully built up with glowing images and color compositions that get us into the feelings of our man and into the characteristics of the mod world in which he dwells\". Even film director Ingmar Bergman, who generally disliked Antonioni, called the film a masterpiece. Anthony Quinn, writing for The Guardian, described Blowup as \"a picture about perception and ambiguity,\" suggesting an association between elements of the film and the Zapruder film of the 1963 Kennedy assassination. According to author Thomas Beltzer, the film explores the \"inherently alienating\" qualities of our media, where \"the camera has turned us into passive voyeurs, programmable for predictable responses, ultimately helpless and even inhumanly dead\". Bilge Eberi of Houston Press notes the contrast between \"the sinewy movements of the girls, their psychedelic jumpsuits and slinky dresses and multicolored minis,\" and \"the blurred, frozen, inchoate unknowability of the death contained within his image,\" explaining that the photo \"is a glimpse of the eternal and elemental \u2013 the dead body and the gun are both in the bushes, almost like a natural fact \u2013 that completely reorders, or rather disorders, Thomas' world. As an artist, he can't capture it or understand it or do anything with it. As an individual, he can't possess it or consume it.\" Roger Ebert described the film as \"a hypnotic conjuring act, in which a character is awakened briefly from a deep sleep of bored alienation and then drifts away again. This is the arc of the film. Not 'Swinging London.' Not existential mystery. Not the parallels between what Hemmings does with his photos and what Antonioni does with Hemmings. But simply the observations that we are happy when we are doing what we do well, and unhappy seeking pleasure elsewhere. I imagine Antonioni was happy when he was making this film.\" In his commentary for the DVD edition of the movie, Peter Brunette connects the film to the existentialist tenet that actions and experiences have no meaning per se, but are given a meaning within a particular context; this is especially borne out by the disposal of the broken guitar after the rock show: \"He's rescued the object, this intensely meaningful object. Yet, out of the context, it's just a broken piece of a guitar [...] the important point here being that meaning, and the construction we put on reality, is always a group social function. And it's contextual.\" Martin Scorsese included it on a list of \"39 Essential Foreign Films for a Young Filmmaker.\""

        "content": "Antonioni's screenplay for Blowup forms a \u201cthriller-suspense\u201d revolving around the efforts of a young and successful fashion photographer in his struggle to determine if a series of snapshots he takes at a public park contain evidence of a murder. As Thomas persists in his role as amateur detective, his quest leads him initially to question his technical mastery over the \u201chidden truth\u201d recorded by his camera, then toward a confrontation with the realities of his life\u2014a life of \u201cmaterial advantages, gained at the expense of ideals.\u201d Finally, the conflicted young man questions the reality of his own existence. Film historian Gordan Gow identifies the object in Antonioni's use of suspense: In an interview at the time of the film's release, Antonioni stated that the film \"is not about man's relationship with man, it is about man's relationship with reality\". Indeed, Gow observes that \u201ca mystery without a solution is instrumental to the theme of disorientation in Antonioni\u2019s Blowup. The theme of uncertainty is sustained until the final moments of the Blowup, when Thomas attempts to resolve the contradictions and ambiguities that arise from his investigations and from his own life, but fails to integrate them. In Blowup\u2019s final sequence, a \u201cgarishly attired\u201d mime troupe arrives at the park\u2014escapees from the real world. Thomas joins them in their fantasy play, and like the non-existent ball he \u201csees\u201d during the troupes\u2019 faux match, he dissolves from view: \u201cAs a creature of the factual world, he no longer exists.\u201d When Blowup\u2019s denouement is reached Thomas\u2019 fate is known and the audience's suspense is resolved, but Antonioni leaves the meaning of the film open to speculation."

Michelangelo Antonioni first asked Eric Burdon to play that scene but he turned it down. In an interview Sterling Morrison of The Velvet Underground claimed that Antonioni had also asked the Velvet Underground to appear in the film, and the band were \"more than willing\", but due to flight expenses of flying the Velvets over from the US, Antonioni instead decided on an English group.  As Keith Relf sings, Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck play to either side along with Chris Dreja. After Jeff Beck's guitar amplifier fails, he bashes his guitar to bits as The Who did at the time. Michelangelo Antonioni had wanted The Who in Blowup as he was fascinated by Pete Townshend's guitar-smashing routine. Steve Howe of Tomorrow recalled and wrote \"We went on the set and started preparing for that guitar-smashing scene in the club. They even went as far as making up a bunch of Gibson 175 replicas and then we got dropped for The Yardbirds who were a bigger name. That's why you see Jeff Beck smashing my guitar rather than his!\" Michelangelo Antonioni also considered using The Velvet Underground (signed at the time to a division of MGM Records) in the nightclub scene but according to guitarist Sterling Morrison, \"the expense of bringing the whole entourage to England proved too much for him\". Janet Street-Porter can be seen dancing in a silver coat and red and yellow striped Carnaby Street trousers during the scene inside the nightclub. A pre-Monty Python Michael Palin can also be seen in the motionless crowd watching The Yardbirds."

Andie's best friend, the outsider Phil \"Duckie\" Dale is in love with her, but is afraid to tell her how he truly feels. In school, Duckie and Andie, along with their friends, are harassed and bullied by the arrogant \"richie\" kids, specifically Benny Hanson and her boyfriend, Steff McKee, who finds Andie attractive and secretly resents having been rejected by her. While working after school at a record store called TRAX, Andie starts talking about her school's senior prom to her manager, Iona, who advises Andie to go, despite not having a date. Blane McDonough, one of the preppy boys and Steff's best friend, starts talking to Andie and eventually asks her out. On the night of the date, Andie waits for Blane at TRAX, but he is late. Duckie enters and asks Andie to go out with him, but she ignores him. When Blane arrives, Duckie becomes upset and argues with Andie before storming off. Blane brings Andie to Steff's house party, where Andie is mistreated by the rich partygoers. Andie then brings Blane to a local nightclub, where Iona is sitting with Duckie, who is hostile toward Blane. After another argument with Duckie, Andie and Blane walk out of the club. Andie tells Blane that she wants to go home, but refuses to let him bring her there, admitting that she doesn't want him to see where she lives. She eventually allows him to drop her off and he asks her to the prom and they share their first kiss. Andie visits Iona the next day to talk about the date. Meanwhile, Blane, pressured by Steff and his rich friends, begins distancing himself from Andie. Jack presents Andie with a pink dress that he has bought for her. However, they begin to argue because Jack has been lying about going to a full-time job. Jack breaks down, revealing that he is still bitter and depressed about his wife having left him. At school, Andie confronts Blane for avoiding her and not returning her calls. When asked about the prom, he claims that he had already asked somebody else but had forgotten. Andie calls Blane a liar and tells him that he is ashamed of being seen with her because he knows his rich friends will not approve. Andie runs away as a teary-eyed Blane leaves, with Steff trashing Andie as he passes. Duckie overhears Steff and attacks him in the hallway. The two fight before teachers intervene. Andie goes to Iona, upset about what happened, and asks for Iona's old prom dress. Using the fabric from Iona's dress and the dress that her father had bought, Andie creates a pink prom dress. When she arrives at the prom, Andie has second thoughts about braving the crowd on her own until she sees Duckie. They reconcile and walk into the ballroom hand in hand. As a drunk Steff begins mocking the couple, Blane confronts him and finally realizes that Steff resents Andie because she had turned down his advances. He calls Steff out on his spoiled and entitled attitude, saying that he no longer wishes to associate with him. Blane shakes Duckie's hand and apologizes to Andie, telling her that he always believed in her and that he will always love her, kissing her cheek before walking out. Duckie concedes that Blane is not like the other rich kids at school and advises Andie to go after him, joking that he will never take her to another prom if she does not. Duckie then sees a girl smiling at him, signaling him to come over and dance with her. Andie catches up with Blane in the parking lot and they kiss."

        "content": "Originally, the film portrayed Andie and Duckie ending up together. However, test audiences booed this ending. John Hughes wrote a new five-page ending where Andie and Blane get together instead. This was shot several months after the film wrapped production, and was filmed in one day on a soundstage designed to look like the Los Angeles hotel ballroom where the first ending had been filmed.  When called back to film the new scene, Andrew McCarthy was in pre-production for a stage play, and had lost weight and cut his hair for the stage role, so he was fitted with a wig for the re-shoot.  Molly Ringwald had anticipated that audiences would be dissatisfied with the original ending, saying: \"It didn't make sense to have the entire movie be this Cinderella story [yet] she doesn't get to end up with the guy she wants.\" Ringwald has said Duckie was based on her best friend, who was gay and with whom she \"had an extremely nonromantic relationship.\" Jon Cryer has stated that he was shocked that the test audience was unhappy about the pairing, and felt that the whole film was built around Andie and Duckie ending up together. Hughes aimed \"to protect Duckie's character\" in the new ending by having another girl at the prom show interest in him, played by Kristy Swanson in her first theatrical film role and credited as \"Duckette.\" Paramount executives were also apprehensive about the original ending, worried that the film might be perceived as classist and as suggesting that wealthy people and poor people should not interact. Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark had selected \"Goddess of Love\" from the album The Pacific Age for the original ending. With only two days before going on tour, OMD wrote \"If You Leave\" in less than 24 hours for the newly re-shot Andie/Blane ending. Paramount has said that they have been unable to locate the footage of the original ending."

The site's consensus reads: \"Molly Ringwald gives an outstanding performance in this sweet, intelligent teen comedy that takes an ancient premise and injects it with insight and wit.\" Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, criticizing the \"old, old, old\" plot but praising the performances of Molly Ringwald and Annie Potts, and calling it \"a heartwarming and mostly truthful movie, with some nice touches of humor.\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote, \"Fortunately, the actors are mostly likable, and the story is told gently enough to downplay both its trendiness and its conventionality.\" James Harwood of Variety wrote, \"In his mid-30s, John Hughes' much-vaunted teen thinking now seems to be maturing a bit in Pretty in Pink, a rather intelligent (if not terribly original) look at adolescent insecurities ... Teamed with Hughes for the third time, Molly Ringwald is herself growing as an actress, lending Pink a solid emotional center that largely boils down to making the audience care about her.\" Pauline Kael of The New Yorker wrote that Ringwald \"carries the movie, though she has nothing particularly interesting to do or say,\" and called the film \"slight and vapid, with the consistency of watery Jello.\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four, faulting a \"tired script\" and Cryer's \"one-note performance,\" though he found Ringwald \"absolutely beguiling.\" Patrick Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times called the film \"delightful,\" adding that \"what makes Pretty in Pink such a satisfying, big-hearted film isn't its creaky story line or its somewhat unconvincing conclusion, but the way it lets us watch kids through their own eyes, exploring feelings instead of making caricatures of them. Written by Hughes and directed by newcomer Howard Deutch, the movie neatly captures the nuances of youth, reminding us how the most casual remark can unleash a flood of insecurities.\" Paul Attanasio of The Washington Post wrote that \"for the most part, Pretty in Pink works from a standard formula\u2014rich boy, poor girl\u2014and does little to tweak or reinvent it.\""

While director Howard Deutch originally intended the film to primarily contain theme music, Hughes influenced Deutch's decision to use post-punk music throughout the film. The title song by the Psychedelic Furs acted as a bit of inspiration for the film and was re-recorded specifically for the film's opening sequence in a version that was less raw than the original version that appeared on the 1981 album Talk Talk Talk. \"Left of Center\" was remixed by Arthur Baker. The first track, \"If You Leave\", by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, was written in 1985 specifically for the film. In addition to their soundtrack song \"Shellshock\", New Order also contributed an instrumental version of  \"Thieves Like Us\"  and the instrumental \"Elegia\", both of which appear in the film but not on the soundtrack. The Rave-Ups, who appear in the film performing \"Positively Lost Me\" and \"Shut-Up\" from their Town and Country album, do not have any songs on the soundtrack album. Nik Kershaw's \"Wouldn't It Be Good\" appears on the soundtrack in a version by former Three Dog Night vocalist Danny Hutton's band, Danny Hutton Hitters. The Smiths' \"Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want\" appears on the soundtrack and was later covered by the Autumns for the 2000 Isn't She Still... The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack Revisited album. Also noteworthy is the inclusion of Echo & the Bunnymen's \"Bring On the Dancing Horses\", which, according to the liner notes of the CD release of the band's compilation album Songs to Learn & Sing, was recorded specifically for the film. The film also includes Otis Redding's \"Try a Little Tenderness\", to which Duckie lip-synchs in the film, the Association's \"Cherish\" and Talk Back's \"Rudy\". These three tracks do not appear on the official soundtrack album. The soundtrack was released on vinyl by A&M Records in 1986. It was re-released in 2013 as a limited edition on pink-colored vinyl. The album was listed on the \"Best Movie Soundtracks: The 15 Film Music Compilations That'll Change Your Life\" list in The Huffington Post and \"The 25 Greatest Soundtracks of All Time\" list in Rolling Stone.

        "content": "Jurassic Park III is a 2001 American science-fiction action film. It is the third installment in the Jurassic Park franchise and the final film in the\u00a0original Jurassic Park\u00a0trilogy, following The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997). The film stars Sam Neill, William H. Macy, T\u00e9a Leoni, Alessandro Nivola, Trevor Morgan, and Michael Jeter. It was written by Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne, and Jim Taylor, and was directed by Joe Johnston. It is the first film in the franchise to not be directed by Steven Spielberg, who served as executive producer, instead. It is also the franchise's first film to not be based on a novel by Michael Crichton, although the film includes characters and ideas by him, including scenes from his first novel Jurassic Park (1990). Like its predecessor, the film takes place on Isla Sorna, a fictional island of cloned dinosaurs located off Central America's Pacific coast. The film involves a divorced couple (portrayed by Macy and Leoni) who trick paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Neill) into helping them find their son (Morgan), who is missing on the island. Neill and Laura Dern reprised their roles from the first film, Jurassic Park (1993). After the release of Spielberg's Jurassic Park, Joe Johnston expressed interest in directing a sequel. Although Spielberg returned to direct the first sequel, he gave Johnston permission to direct a possible third film. Universal Pictures announced a third film in June 1998, with a release scheduled for mid-2000. Craig Rosenberg wrote the first draft of the script, about teenagers becoming marooned on Isla Sorna. Johnston was announced as director in 1999, and Rosenberg's draft was rejected. A second draft, by Buchman, involved dinosaur attacks in various mainland locations, while a parallel story within the script would involve Alan Grant and others crash-landing on Isla Sorna. Around five weeks before the start of filming, Johnston and Spielberg rejected the second draft in favor of a simpler story idea suggested by David Koepp, the writer of the previous two films. Payne and Taylor were hired to rewrite the earlier script by Buchman, who made further revisions to their draft. The script also received uncredited work by John August. Filming lasted five months, and began in Hawaii on August 30, 2000, before moving to California. A final draft of the script was never completed during production, and Johnston considered quitting the project on a few occasions because of uncertainty about how the film would turn out. As with previous films, Jurassic Park III features a combination of computer-generated and animatronic dinosaurs, created respectively by Industrial Light & Magic and Stan Winston. Unlike the previous films, Jurassic Park III features a Spinosaurus as the main dinosaur antagonist, replacing the Tyrannosaurus rex. The same creature would then make its return in the fourth season of Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous twenty years later. Jurassic Park III was theatrically released on July 18, 2001. Despite mixed reviews from critics, the film was successful at the box office, grossing $368 million worldwide. Nevertheless, it is the lowest-grossing installment in the series. The next film in the series, Jurassic World, was released in June 2015, starting the Jurassic World trilogy. Neill and Dern will reprise their roles in Jurassic World Dominion, scheduled to be released on June 10, 2022."

The boat's crew is killed by an unknown attacker, prompting Ben to detach the line before the vessel crashes into rocks. Eric and Ben drift towards the island. Eight weeks later, paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant has discovered the intelligence of velociraptors in the form of a resonating larynx, but he struggles to secure funding for his research. Grant discusses his discovery with a longtime colleague and former partner, Ellie. This, and his experiences on Isla Nublar, leads him to believe that velociraptors were socially sophisticated. He hypothesizes that if they had not gone extinct and continued to evolve, their descendants\u2014rather than humans\u2014would have become Earth's dominant species. His assistant, Billy Brennan, uses a three-dimensional printer to replicate the velociraptor larynx. Paul and Amanda Kirby, a seemingly wealthy couple, offer to fund Grant's research if he gives them an illegal aerial tour of Isla Sorna. Grant reluctantly agrees and flies there with Paul, Amanda, Billy, Kirbys' mercenary associates Udesky and Cooper, and their pilot Nash. Unfortunately, Grant learns that the Kirbys' plan to land; he protests, but Cooper knocks him unconscious. Grant awakens and realizes that the plane has landed. While establishing a perimeter, the three mercenaries are approached by a Spinosaurus. Nash and Udesky board the plane to escape, leaving Cooper behind to fend for himself. Just as they prepare to lift off, the Spinosaurus emerges on the runway and devours Cooper. Nash hits the Spinosaurus, and the plane crashes into the forest. The massive animal tears into the plane's fuselage and eats Nash, who has Paul's satellite phone. The other survivors take advantage of the distraction and flee, only to encounter a Tyrannosaurus. As they retreat in the opposite direction, they are again confronted by the Spinosaurus. It fights the T. Rex and kills it, giving the group enough time to press deeper into the jungle. Grant confronts the Kirbys, and they tell him they are, in reality, a middle-class, divorced couple searching for their son Eric and Amanda's boyfriend Ben, who has gone missing on the island. Unfortunately, government agencies declined to help the Kirbys, so they deceived Grant and brought him along as an expert because of his past at Jurassic Park. To their dismay, Grant reveals that he has only been to Isla Nublar, not Isla Sorna, and as such, is just as lost as they are. The group looks for Eric and Ben and then makes for the coast. They find Ben's parasail and his corpse attached to it. (Ben was eaten and killed by dinosaurs before he could free himself from the parasail) They fold the parasail and continue stumbling upon a colony of raptor nests by chance. Further ahead, they enter an abandoned InGen compound. A lone raptor ambushes Amanda and pursues the rest of the group deeper into the compound. After Billy and Amanda trap it, it panics and summons the rest of its pack by calling for help. Grant leads the lot into a herd of Corythosaurus and Parasaurolophus, causing a stampede and separating Grant and Udesky from the others. The raptors trap Udesky and attempt to lure Paul, Amanda, and Billy from their place in a tree. The raptors almost succeed in securing Amanda when she tries to descend to help Udesky. However, before departing, the predators slay Udesky by snapping his neck. Elsewhere, Grant observes the raptors communicating and suspects that they are searching for something. Grant tries to slip away, but the raptors corner him. Eric distracts the raptors with canisters of gas and brings Grant away to an overturned supply truck, where he has lived for his stay on the island. The next day, Grant and Eric reunite with Billy and the Kirbys after Eric hears his dad's satellite phone ringtone. The Spinosaurus, still digesting the phone, appears and chases the group, but they get away by locking themselves inside an abandoned observatory. Grant, suspicious of Billy, checks the young man's bag and finds that he took two raptor eggs from the nests to use for funding. Grant decides to keep the eggs to ensure that the raptors, provoked by this theft, will continue to chase, rather than kill, them. The six descend unknowingly into a large aviary used to house Pteranodons. A small flock of them attacks the humans and flies away with Eric. Billy rescues Eric using Ben's parasail but is swarmed and seemingly killed by the Pteranodons. The rest escape the aviary but leave the door unlocked. They board a small barge outside the aviary and make their way down a river. That night, they retrieve the ringing satellite phone from the feces of the Spinosaurus. Grant contacts Ellie and tells her where they are, but the Spinosaurus slams into the barge. Fuel from the boat begins to leak into the water. Grant ignites the fuel using a flare gun, and the Spinosaurus dashes for safety. Afterward, the Kirbys finally reconcile as a family while Grant looks on. The following morning, they, at last, arrive at the coast but are surrounded by the raptor pack led by a matriarch. Grant uses the replica raptor larynx to confuse the pack and present their eggs. They reclaim their unborn young and then disappear one by one into the jungle. The Marine Corps rescue them and the Navy on the beach, summoned by Ellie in response to Grant's desperate call. They discover that Billy has also been recovered, albeit in a seriously injured state. They watch the newly escaped Pteranodons fly alongside them as they leave the island."

Michael Crichton, who wrote the Jurassic Park novels, was to collaborate with Spielberg to create a storyline and write a script, although Johnston later said that Crichton had no involvement with the project. The film was initially set for release in mid-2000. Spielberg initially devised a story involving Dr. Alan Grant, who was discovered to have been living on one of InGen's islands. According to Johnston, \"He'd snuck in, after not being allowed in to research the dinosaurs, and was living in a tree like Robinson Crusoe. But I couldn't imagine this guy wanting to get back on any island that had dinosaurs in it after the first movie.\" Craig Rosenberg, who previously wrote and directed Hotel de Love, began writing the first draft of Jurassic Park III in June 1999. Spielberg and Johnston were impressed by Rosenberg's prior work, which included thriller screenplays for Spielberg's company DreamWorks. Rosenberg's draft involved teenagers becoming marooned on Isla Sorna, and it included a sequence involving the aquatic reptile Kronosaurus, which was not featured in the final film. Another scrapped scene would involve characters on motorcycles trying to evade raptors. Johnston was announced as the film's director in August 1999, with Rosenberg still attached. Spielberg gave complete creative freedom to Johnston, who said that Spielberg \"has strongly pointed out that I shouldn't try to copy him.\" Production was expected to begin in early 2000. The previous films were shot in Hawaii, and the island of Kauai was the preferred filming location for the third film, although no decisions would be made until the finalization of the script. Rosenberg's draft about teenagers on Isla Sorna was rejected in September 1999. Johnston said it was \"not a badly written script\", but he felt that viewers would not want to see such a story. He also said, \"It read like a bad episode of Friends\"."

        "content": "Peter Buchman was hired to rewrite Rosenberg's draft, and did so going into early 2000. Buchman's draft involves dinosaurs causing a series of mysterious killings on the mainland, followed by an investigation. The script also has a parallel story that involves Alan Grant, Billy, and a family crash-landing on Isla Sorna. The draft begins with a vacationing couple who go parasailing over Isla Sorna, becoming the latest tourists to go missing there. A representative for the U.S. State Department, Harlan Finch, goes to Costa Rica and meets environmentalist Simone Garcia, who informs him of a recent dinosaur attack. Meanwhile, Grant is seeking financial donors for a raptor research station that he wants to build on Isla Sorna. Finch offers Grant exclusive research rights to the island if he will help the U.S. government acquire jurisdiction over it. Grant agrees, and is scheduled to testify along with Simone at a hearing, to be held the next day in San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica. Grant also meets Paul Roby, a wealthy businessman who offers him a donation if he will host an aerial tour of Isla Sorna. Grant agrees, and they fly over the island prior to the hearing, along with Grant's graduate student Billy Hume and Paul's 12-year-old son Miles, a dinosaur enthusiast. Also on the tour is Paul's bodyguard Cooper, and Susan Brentworth, Paul's business associate and girlfriend. The plane is forced to land on the island after hitting an unidentified object. As it takes off again, it hits a Spinosaurus and crashes. The story would then alternate between the island and San Jos\u00e9. The hearing would reveal that dinosaur attacks have taken place in various mainland locations, ranging from the Baja California Peninsula to Panama. Finch becomes concerned that the dinosaurs are breeding, thus posing a worldwide problem. The island scenes would largely play out the same as the final film, although the aviary and InGen laboratory sequences were much longer and more complex in this draft. Part of the script would involve the humans spending the night in the laboratory and making it their base of operations, although velociraptors would eventually sneak into the lab, after Billy stole their eggs. The humans would escape on dirt bikes and later take refuge in treetops. Cooper would die to velociraptors while protecting Miles, and Billy would die to a Pteranodon during the aviary sequence. Near the end of the draft, the U.S. government sends in fighter jets to bomb the island and destroy its dinosaur population. In the process, Roby is spotted by a pilot and he and his family are rescued from the island. However, Grant refuses to leave and, in his final scene, retreats into the jungle, incorporating Spielberg's initial idea. These final scenes inspired the title Jurassic Park: Extinction, although the filmmakers decided against this name as it seemed to suggest a definitive end to the franchise. Johnston also considered it a vague title, with Extinction potentially referring to the dinosaurs, the human population, or Grant. The name was eventually simplified as Jurassic Park III. Johnston said that no one was \"particularly fond\" of the title \"but you certainly knew what it meant\". Other potential titles included Jurassic Park: Breakout and The Extinction: Jurassic Park 3. Filming locations were scouted for this draft, including Fiordland, New Zealand, which was once considered as a location for the previous film. In March 2000, Maui, Hawaii, reportedly had been chosen instead of New Zealand."

        "title": "Jurassic Park III_Casting and further rewrites",
        "content": "Sam Neill signed to the project in June 2000, reprising his role from the first film as Dr. Alan Grant. Johnston later described Grant in the third film as being more cynical and sarcastic following the character's experience in the first film. Neill was happy to return, as he felt his performance in the first film could have been better. Hawaii was confirmed as a filming location for a three-week shoot, and filming overall was expected to take 18 weeks. Filming was scheduled to begin by August 2000, with a projected release in July 2001. William H. Macy originally turned down his role due to scheduling conflicts, so filming was delayed by a month. Macy had been working with Laura Dern on the 2001 film Focus, and she urged him to accept the role in Jurassic Park III. Trevor Morgan and T\u00e9a Leoni were subsequently announced as cast members. Johnston felt that Buchman's draft was too complicated, particularly in getting Alan Grant back to an island of dinosaurs. When screenwriter David Koepp held discussions with Johnston, Koepp suggested the simpler \"rescue mission\" plot. Koepp had written the previous two films, but had no involvement in writing the script for Jurassic Park III. In July 2000, about five weeks before filming began, Johnston and Spielberg rejected the entire second script because they were dissatisfied with it; $18 million had already been spent on the film, which had been storyboarded and budgeted. Some set-building had already begun, as well. The rejection came after Johnston and Spielberg approved Koepp's story idea, believing it to be superior to the earlier story. Many sequences from the second rejected draft, and some from the original draft, were incorporated into the final film as a way of salvaging the work that had been put into the project up to that point. At the time, Utah's Dinosaur National Monument and a military base at Oahu were being considered as filming locations. Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor began rewriting Buchman's script in July 2000, while Spielberg signed a deal with Universal to receive 20% of the film's profits. Payne and Taylor were hired to improve the film's characters and story, as the script primarily consisted of action. They were surprised to receive the writing offer, as the project differed from past films on which they had worked, but Universal had been impressed with their rewrite on the studio's film Meet the Parents. Payne and Taylor were not hardcore fans of the Jurassic Park franchise, although Taylor enjoyed its premise. The two writers watched the previous Jurassic Park films and spent the next four weeks writing their draft of the script. Payne and Taylor had previously written Citizen Ruth (1996), which starred Dern. She had also portrayed Ellie in the first Jurassic Park film. The character was absent from the previous Jurassic Park III script, so Payne and Taylor decided to write in a small part for Dern to reprise the role. She was initially hesitant to reappear only for a cameo, so Spielberg suggested that Ellie have an important role in saving the characters on the island. Dern was convinced after learning that Payne and Taylor were working on the script. In one draft, Neill and Dern's characters were a couple in the process of splitting up. Johnston said, \"I didn't want to see them as a couple anymore. For one thing, I don't think they look like a couple. It would be uncomfortable to still see them together. And Laura Dern doesn't look like she's aged for the past 15 years!\" Buchman made subsequent revisions to the script, and John August did uncredited work on it, as well. Much of the humor added by Payne and Taylor was not used in the final film. According to Payne, \"We gave them a new script, and then we saw the movie, and it's all action. They took the rest out!\" Writing credit ultimately went to Buchman, Payne, and Taylor. Johnston described the final film as simpler, faster-moving, and more intense than the earlier films."

        "content": "A final draft of the script was never completed during production. Johnston said, \"We shot pages that eventually went into the final script, but we didn't have a document\". While the first act was mostly in place, the middle portion of the script was not as complete, and the ending had yet to be written. Principal photography began on August 30, 2000, and it lasted five months. Filming the script was a lengthy process because of technical preparations before scenes. Macy criticized the project during filming. Commenting on the slow pace of filming, Macy said \"we would do a quarter-page, [or] some days, an eighth of a page. And that would be a full 12-hour day.\" Johnston said that filming ultimately went over schedule by a few days, primarily because of weather and unexpected technical issues, although he was satisfied with how the schedule eventually turned out considering these issues. Macy also noted that executive producer Spielberg was not seen on set, despite a chair bearing his name that was always present, with Macy saying, \"You don't know if it's a threat or a promise!\" Spielberg was busy creating the 2001 film A.I. Artificial Intelligence. While Macy was impressed with the Jurassic Park III footage, he criticized the project for starting without a finished script: \"The script has been evolving and being rewritten as we go, and what you want to say is, 'Who launched a $100 million ship without a rudder, and who's getting fired for this?' But that's the way it goes. That's the way they make these movies... big deal. I think someone should be shot, but I'm not in charge.\" Johnston said the actors went through an uncomfortable production shoot and that Macy may have simply made the critical comments on a bad day of filming. As the film approached its release, Macy said, \"It was about the most amazing thing I've ever done in this business.\" Johnston thought about quitting the project on a few occasions because of uncertainty about how the film would turn out, considering that it did not have a finished script. He said that making the film was \"a living hell on a daily basis\", and that shooting without a finished script was \"nerve-wracking, but it was also a way of freeing up the whole creative process. We could literally decide on the day how we wanted a scene to progress. I'm not saying it's the way to make movies, but it gives you more freedom.\" Johnston said the actors were \"very flexible\" and that they dealt with the lack of a finished script \"the best they could.\" Alessandro Nivola criticized the film after its release, saying, \"It was like the only part I've ever done that just had nothing for me to latch on to, character-wise,\" saying, \"It was kind of maddening.\" The actors were frequently bruised during filming. Leoni said \"more of my makeup was to cover the real bruises than to create fake ones.\" Michael Lantieri, who worked on the previous films, returned as the special effects consultant. Lantieri said that Jurassic Park III was the most physically demanding film of the series: \"We had a cast that was willing to get real bruises and bumps, be around real heat, and actually go underwater.\""

        "content": "Filming began at Dillingham Airfield in Mokul\u0113ia, Hawaii, and continued on Oahu during early September 2000. Filming in Oahu included Heeia Kea Ranch. Aerial footage of Molokai's North Shore cliffs was then filmed over a two-day period, followed by a week of filming in Kauai, where locations included Hanalei Valley and rain forests in the Manoa Valley. Filming in Hawaii concluded in mid-September 2000, after scenes were shot at the South Fork of Kauai's Wailua River. By that time, John August had been hired to do the uncredited script revisions, which were followed by additional work from Buchman. Macy also wrote a scene. After the Hawaii shoot, production moved to California. A dinosaur lecture given by the character of Alan Grant was filmed at Occidental College in Los Angeles on October 10, 2000. Scenes were filmed at Center Bay Studios in Los Angeles at the end of October. Other filming locations in California included a rock quarry in Irwindale, while the interior of the InGen compound was filmed in a warehouse located east of downtown Los Angeles. Another scene was filmed at El Mirage Lake, where Udesky and the mercenaries prepare for their visit to Isla Sorna. Dern's small role as Ellie was filmed in a day. Scenes set at Ellie's house were filmed in South Pasadena, California. Filming subsequently moved to Universal Studios' backlot in Los Angeles for 96 days. Production designer Ed Verreaux and greensman Danny Ondrejko created a jungle rain forest at Universal's Stage 12. Ondrejko and his 14-member team took two months to create the jungle set, and Lantieri's team created mist and fog through the use of pipes. Johnston was impressed with the set and had difficulty distinguishing it from the jungles in Hawaii. The most challenging scene for Lantieri was the Spinosaurus attack on the plane, which was filmed on a soundstage. Lantieri's team built four plane props for the scene. The beginning of the scene depicts the crashed airplane in a tree,  above ground, before the plane later falls to the ground and is rolled around by the Spinosaurus. For the early portion of the sequence, Lantieri created a pneumatic gimbal disguised as a tree, with the plane placed on top. The gimble had 100 horsepower and was powered by hydraulics and hoses. It allowed the plane to be shaken and tilted. The plane also had a breakaway cockpit area for a shot in which the Spinosaurus tears the front end off. A later portion of the attack scene required close collaboration with Winston's team, which created a full-scale Spinosaurus leg prop, controlled by puppeteers. The leg, suspended in the air by two poles, was slammed down into one of the plane fuselage props for a series of shots. Another prop plane was rigged with a hydraulic machine, which crushed the fuselage from the inside, giving the impression that it was being crushed by the Spinosaurus. With another prop plane, the actors were filmed inside the fuselage as it is rolled around. The actors agreed to do their own stunts for the scene, which Macy compared to being inside a clothes dryer. Stunt people were only used for one shot during this scene. The film is the first in the series not to be based on a novel, although it includes characters and ideas from Crichton, who wrote the novels that inspired the previous two films. For Jurassic Park III, Crichton received a \"based on characters created by\" credit. Scenes involving a pterosaur aviary and a T. rexs attempted attack on a river raft were featured in the first novel Jurassic Park (1990). Although these scenes were absent from the novel's film adaptation, they were added into Jurassic Park III. The film's Spinosaurus attack on the boat is a modified version of the scene from the novel. At Falls Lake, located on the Universal lot, Verreaux and his team built a giant rock wall as part of a set that would depict InGen's Pteranodon aviary. Three months were spent laying foam blocks that were molded by hand to form jagged rock. A team subsequently built a 10-story, three-sided scaffold covered with netting to simulate the aviary. The aviary scene was filmed in early December 2000. The set was then redecorated for the nighttime exterior sequence in which the Spinosaurus attacks the boat. The scene involved rain and fire, and took nine nights of filming. Part of the scene required Macy to stand on a giant crane and distract the Spinosaurus. Macy fell off the crane, but had a harness. Another portion of the scene required the actors to perform under water. The scene depicting the satellite phone in Spinosaurus feces was filmed using  of oatmeal. In a November 2000 draft of the script, the U.S. State Department was to send in a helicopter and Ellie to rescue the characters, with Ellie explaining that she arrived thanks to a good friend at the department. This ending was not considered exciting enough, resulting in the final ending with the Marines and Navy coming to rescue the characters, while excluding Ellie from coming to the island. In the final film, Ellie's husband is an employee of the State Department, although his involvement in rescuing the group is not specified. The new ending was written in December 2000, and the Pentagon lent two Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawks to the production, as well as four assault amphibious vehicles and 80 Marines. Production returned to Hawaii in January 2001 to film the ending on Kauai's Pila'a Beach. The film's longest rough cut without credits was around 96 minutes long. According to Johnston, \"We lost maybe 8 minutes, so it was never really that long\"."

        "title": "Jurassic Park III_Creatures on screen",
        "content": "As with the previous films, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) provided dinosaurs through computer-generated imagery (CGI), while Stan Winston and his team provided animatronics. The animatronics were more advanced than those used in previous films, and included the ability to blink, for an increased sense of realism. While animatronics were used for close-up shots, other scenes used sticks with pictures of dinosaur heads attached, as placeholders to which the actors could react. Puppeteers worked together to create the T. rex, Spinosaurus, and Velociraptor movements. Multiple puppeteers were assigned to operate different parts of each animatronic dinosaur, and in some cases, hours of practice were needed for a dinosaur's puppeteers to perform in synchrony. The animatronics were powerful and considered dangerous, as one wrong move could kill someone. One scene, depicting Udesky's death, was filmed with Winston team member John Rosengrant wearing a partial raptor suit. Winston's team took roughly 13 months to design and create the various practical dinosaurs. ILM scanned dinosaur sculptures, also created by Winston's team, to create the computer-generated versions of the animals. ILM also designed some dinosaurs entirely through CGI, including Ankylosaurus and Brachiosaurus. New dinosaurs not featured in earlier films included the Ankylosaurus, in addition to Ceratosaurus and Corythosaurus. Paleontologist Jack Horner worked as the film's technical advisor, as he had done for the previous films. Horner was brought on early in the film's development when story ideas were being considered. After two films, the filmmakers wanted to replace the T. rex with a new dinosaur antagonist. Baryonyx was originally considered, and early concept posters reflected this. Horner ultimately convinced the filmmakers to replace the T. rex with the larger Spinosaurus, an animal which had a distinctive sail on its back. Johnston stated, \"A lot of dinosaurs have a very similar silhouette to the T. rex\u00a0... and we wanted the audience to instantly recognize this as something else\". Horner hypothesized that T. rex was more of a scavenger, while Spinosaurus was a true predator. Winston and his sculptors created an initial Spinosaurus design, and Horner then provided his scientific opinion. Winston's team began with a 1/16 maquette version of the Spinosaurus, before creating a 1/5-scale version with more detail, leading to the creation of the final, full-scale version. The process took 10 months. The Spinosaurus animatronic was built from the knees up, while full body shots of the animal were done through CGI. The Spinosaurus animatronic measured 44 feet long, weighed 13 tons, and was faster and more powerful than the 9-ton T. rex. Winston and his team had to remove a wall to get the Spinosaurus animatronic out of Winston's studio, located in Van Nuys, California. It was then transported by flatbed truck to the jungle set at Universal Studios' Stage 12. Verreaux had to design the set to accommodate the dinosaur. At the soundstage, the Spinosaurus was placed on a track that allowed the creature to be moved backward and forward. Four Winston technicians were required to fully operate the Spinosaurus animatronic. The fight between the Spinosaurus and T. rex was one of the last scenes shot for the film, and the two animatronics were put to extensive use for the fight. A T. rex animatronic from the previous film was re-skinned for its appearance in Jurassic Park III. The Spinosaurus animatronic was so powerful that it ripped the head off of the T. rex during filming. Johnston said the fight was meant as a modern homage to various earlier films that featured dinosaurs created by Ray Harryhausen. An early script featured a death sequence for the Spinosaurus near the end of the film, as Alan Grant would use the resonating chamber to call a pack of raptors which would attack and kill it. Because of new discoveries and theories in the field of paleontology, several dinosaurs are portrayed differently in this film from in previous ones. Discoveries suggesting velociraptors were feathered prompted the addition of quill-like structures on the head and neck of the males in the film. Horner said, \"We've found evidence that velociraptors had feathers, or feather-like structures, and we've incorporated that into the new look of the raptor\". Spielberg insisted that Johnston include Pteranodons, which had been removed from the previous films for budget reasons, with the exception of a brief appearance in The Lost World: Jurassic Park. The Pteranodons featured in Jurassic Park III are a fictionalized version of the actual animal. The animals were created with a combination of animatronics and puppetry. Winston and his team created a Pteranodon model with a wingspan of 40 feet, although the creatures are predominantly featured in the film through CGI. ILM animators studied footage of bats and birds while in flight, and also closely worked with a Pteranodon expert to create the creatures' flight movements. Winston's team also designed and created five rod puppets to depict baby pteranodons in a nest, with puppeteers working underneath the nest to control them. Johnston chose the pteranodons to end the film because he wanted an ending shot of \"these creatures being beautiful and elegant\". At one point, there were discussions about a final sequence in which the pteranodons would attack the survivors in their helicopter after departing from the island. This was scrapped for budgetary reasons. The film contains more than 400 effects shots, about twice the number featured in the two previous films combined. Most of the shots were for the fight between the T. rex and Spinosaurus, and for the Pteranodon aviary sequence. Less than half of the 400 effects shots involved dinosaurs, as the animators also had to focus on environmental surroundings, such as jungle foliage brushed by dinosaurs. Some shots were only a few seconds long, but required months of work."

Universal avoided excessive early marketing to prevent a possible backlash; the studio believed awareness of the film was already sufficient. Marketing began in April 2001, three months before the film's release. The first footage from the film was aired during the second-season finale of Survivor in May 2001, and the official website went online at the end of June 2001. Promotional partners included Kodak and the Coca-Cola Company. No fast-food promotions took place in the United States, although children's meal toys based on the film were offered in Canadian Burger King outlets. A novelization by Scott Ciencin, aimed at young children, was published, as well. Ciencin also wrote three children's books to tie in with the film's events: Jurassic Park Adventures: Survivor, the first book, details the eight weeks Eric spent alone on Isla Sorna; Jurassic Park Adventures: Prey has Eric and Alan returning to Isla Sorna to rescue a group of teenage filmmakers; and Jurassic Park Adventures: Flyers involves Eric and Alan leading the Pteranodon home after they nest in a Universal Studios theme park. In early 2001, Hasbro released a line of  action figures including electronic dinosaurs, humans, and vehicles, to coincide with the film's release. The figures were scaled down from the original Kenner action figures from the pre-Jurassic Park III toy lines. A line of toys were also released through the Lego Studios brand. Playskool released a line of toys called Jurassic Park Junior, which were aimed at young children. A smaller line of die-cast toys and a range of clothes were also produced. In November 2001, to promote the film's impending home media release, Universal launched a viral marketing website for Isla Travel, a fictional Isla Sorna travel agency."

The site's critics consensus reads: \"Jurassic Park III is darker and faster than its predecessors, but that doesn't quite compensate for the franchise's continuing creative decline.\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\u2013\" on an A+ to F scale. On Metacritic, it is the lowest-rated film of the Jurassic Park franchise, and Universal did not allow reviews to be published until the film's release. Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman, who praised the previous Jurassic Park films, awarded the third film a C grade, writing \"Jurassic Park III has no pretensions to be anything more than a goose-bumpy fantasy theme-park ride for kids, but it's such a routine ride. Spielberg's wizardry is gone, and his balletic light touch as well, and that gives too much of this 90-minute movie over to the duller-than-dull characters.\" Derek Elley of Variety called the film \"an all-action, helter-skelter, don't-forget-to-buy-the-computer-game ride that makes the two previous installments look like models of classic filmmaking\". Ben Varkontine of PopMatters called it \"not as good a ride as the first, but a damn sight better than the second\". Much of the criticism was leveled at the plot as being simply a chase movie with no character development; Apollo Movie Guide panned the film as being \"almost the same as the first movie\" with \"no need for new ideas or even a script\". Empire magazine gave the film 3 stars out of 5, calling it \"short, scrappy and intermittently scary\". On Ebert and Roeper, Richard Roeper gave it a Thumbs Down while Roger Ebert awarded a Thumbs Up. In a subsequent review, Ebert called it \"the best blockbuster of the Summer\". In his review, Ebert gave the film three stars and said it \"is not as awe-inspiring as the first film or as elaborate as the second, but in its own B-movie way it's a nice little thrill machine\". He also wrote, \"I can't praise it for its art, but I must not neglect its craft, and on that basis I recommend it\". Paleontologist Robert T. Bakker, an early pioneer of the dinosaur-bird connection, said the feather quills added to the Velociraptor for Jurassic Park III \"looked like a roadrunner's toupee\", but conceded that feathers are difficult subjects for computer animation and speculated that Jurassic Park IV's raptors would have more realistic plumage. Spielberg, according to his spokesman, was \"very happy\" with Johnston's work on the film. In 2002, Crichton said he had not watched the film. Some fans of the series were upset with the decision to kill off the T. rex and replace it with a new dinosaur. Some later reviews of the film have been positive, with a couple of critics declaring it superior to The Lost World: Jurassic Park. Retrospective reviews have also praised the aviary sequence. Simon Brew, writing for Den of Geek, stated in 2007 that the film has \"an efficiency and focus\" that was missing in the previous film, writing, \"Here, there's no educational aspect. There's no messing around.\" He enjoyed the set pieces, but criticized the abrupt ending. Comparing the first film with Jurassic Park III, David Chen of /Film wrote in 2009 that the original managed to \"thrill audiences and make them think\", while the latter \"did neither particularly well\". Several critics reviewed the film in 2015, when Jurassic World was released. Justin Harp of Digital Spy wrote that despite the shortcomings of Jurassic Park III, it \"remains immensely watchable and visually impressive. It manages to strike a clear balance between moments of terror and genuine laughs.\" Although Harp considered the film to be the black sheep of the series, he described it as \"fresh, exciting and, most of all, a whole lot of fun.\" Matt Goldberg of Collider wrote that the film \"doesn't really have any reason to exist beyond proving that the franchise maybe never should have been a franchise to begin with.\" Goldberg stated that the film \"is overly excited to let you know [the raptors] can vocally speak to each other, which ends up just looking funny. It feels like we're missing subtitles\". Zaki Hasan of Sequart Organization enjoyed the film, but wrote that it has issues such as the abrupt ending. Entertainment Weekly, in 2018, wrote \"what the plot lacks in credibility it makes up for with relatability.\" The magazine praised it as the only film in the series that \"has zero to do with scientific stupidity or sinister corporate forces,\" writing that it was \"perhaps the most narratively original\" film out of all them. Neill said in 2021 that he believes the film is \"dismissed too easily\", opining that it is \"pretty damn good\" aside from the final 10 minutes and \"hurried\" ending."

        "content": "After a fight, Joel Barish discovers that his girlfriend Clementine Kruczynski has had her memories of him erased by the New York City firm Lacuna. Heartbroken, he decides to undergo the same procedure. In preparation, he records a tape for Lacuna, recounting his memories of their volatile relationship. The Lacuna employees work on Joel's brain as he sleeps in his apartment so that he will wake up with no memory of the procedure. One employee, Patrick, leaves to see Clementine; since her procedure, he has been using Joel's and Clementine's memories as a guide for seducing her. While the procedure runs on Joel's brain, technician Stan and secretary Mary party and have sex. Joel re-experiences his memories of Clementine as they are erased, starting with their last fight. As he reaches earlier, happier memories, he realizes that he does not want to forget her. His mental projection of Clementine suggests that Joel hide her in memories that do not involve her. This halts the procedure, but Stan calls his boss, Howard, who arrives and restarts it. Joel comes to his last remaining memory of Clementine: the day they first met, on a beach in Montauk. As the memory crumbles around them, Clementine tells Joel to meet her in Montauk. In Joel's apartment, while Stan is outside, Mary tells Howard she is in love with him and they kiss. Howard's wife arrives, and, from the street, sees them through the window. Furious, she tells Howard to tell Mary the truth: that Mary and Howard previously had an affair, and that Mary had her memories erased. Disgusted, Mary steals the Lacuna records and mails them to the patients, including Joel and Clementine. Joel wakes up, his memories of Clementine erased. He impulsively goes to Montauk and meets Clementine again on the train home. They are drawn to each other and go on a date to the frozen Charles River in Boston. Joel drives Clementine home and Patrick sees them, realizing they have found each other again. Joel and Clementine receive their Lacuna records and listen to their tapes. They are shocked by the bitter memories they had of each other, but agree to try again."

        "content": "Jim Carrey as Joel Barish: A bookish introvert who enters a two-year relationship with Clementine Kruczynski. After their relationship ends, Clementine erases Joel from her memory, and he erases her from his mind in response. Charlie Kaufman wrote Joel with autobiographical personality traits. Producers cast Carrey against type for his role as Joel, selecting him for his everyday appearance, as well as his comedic ability. According to Gondry, this was because \"It's hard to be funny. It's far easier to take someone really funny and bring them down than do the opposite.\" To induce Carrey, an actor who typically portrayed high-energy roles, to portray a restrained character, Gondry would not allow him to improvise, a restriction he did not place on the other cast members (Carrey objected). Gondry also put Carrey off balance by giving misleading orders or by rolling the camera at the wrong time. Gondry believed this would make Carrey forget what he should do to be Joel, allowing him to go in character. In the 2017 Netflix documentary Jim & Andy, Carrey mentions a conversation with Gondry one year before shooting began for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, shortly after Carrey had a breakup with an unspecified woman. Gondry saw that Carrey's emotional state at the time was \"so beautiful, so broken\" that he asked him to stay that way for one year to fit the character. In the documentary, Carrey commented, \"That's how fucked up this business is.\" Nicolas Cage was Gondry's original choice to play Joel, but Cage was unavailable as he was in high demand from independent directors after his performance in Leaving Las Vegas. Kate Winslet as Clementine Kruczynski: A spontaneous extrovert who, after breaking up with him after a two-year relationship, erases Joel Barish from her mind. Producers cast Winslet against type for her part as Clementine, as Winslet had previously featured heavily in period pieces. She received the role after she was the only actress to offer criticism on the script instead of pandering to the writers. After another actor won an Oscar, the studio attempted to make Gondry use her instead of Winslet for the role of Clementine, but Gondry threatened to walk from the project if that occurred. During filming, Gondry took Winslet to separate rooms to coach her, and she wore wigs instead of dying her hair. Some commentators note how Clementine's character criticizes the Manic Pixie Dream Girl stock character several years before film critic Nathan Rabin coined the phrase. Most commentators discuss one particular example to demonstrate this criticism, wherein Clementine warns Joel she is flawed: \"Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive. But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.\" With her impulsiveness, emotional intensity (extreme mood changes), alcohol dependence, turbulent relationships, reckless behavior, and hasty idealization or devaluation of Joel, Clementine seems to exhibit traits of borderline personality disorder, although it is not clear whether Kaufman wrote her character with this specific diagnosis in mind. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Svevo: The receptionist for Lacuna who, while dating Stan Fink, has a crush on Howard Mierzwiak. While erasing Joel's memory, Howard's wife catches her kissing Howard. Howard's wife reveals Mary previously had a relationship with Howard, which Howard erased from her mind. She reacts to this information by quitting her job and mailing Lacuna's company records to its customers. In the script, Mary and Howard's relationship resulted in an unplanned pregnancy, leading to Howard pressuring Mary into an abortion, which Howard also erased from her memory. Mark Ruffalo as Stan Fink: A technician for Lacuna who is in a relationship with Mary Svevo until the reveal of her previous relationship with Howard Mierzwiak. Ruffalo received the role of Stan after providing an \"unexpected take on the role\" to Gondry when he suggested Stan be a fan of the Clash and resemble Joe Strummer. Elijah Wood as Patrick Wertz: Patrick is a technician for Lacuna who enters a relationship with Clementine by imitating Joel. They break up when Joel and Clementine begin dating for the second time. Seth Rogen auditioned for the role. Tom Wilkinson as Dr. Howard Mierzwiak: Howard runs Lacuna. Before the film's events, he had an affair with Mary, which ended with the relationship's erasure from her mind. Wilkinson reportedly did not enjoy the shooting of the film and clashed with Gondry. Jane Adams as Carrie Eakin: Joel Barish's friend. She is in a troubled relationship with Rob Eakin. David Cross as Rob Eakin: Joel Barish's friend. In a troubled relationship with Carrie Eakin."

        "content": "The concept of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind came from 1998 conversations between director Michel Gondry and co-writer Pierre Bismuth. The pair had met and become friends in the early 1980s during Gondry's drumming career in the French pop group Oui Oui. Bismuth had conceived of the idea of erasing certain people from people's minds in response to a friend complaining about her boyfriend; when he asked her if she would erase that boyfriend from her memory, she said yes. Bismuth originally planned to conduct an art experiment involving sending cards to people saying someone they knew had erased the card's recipient from their memory. When he mentioned this to Gondry, they developed it into a story based on the situations that would arise if it were scientifically possible. Bismuth never carried out his experiment idea. Gondry approached writer Charlie Kaufman with this concept, and they developed it into a short pitch. While the writers did not believe the concept was marketable, a small bidding war began over the idea. Steve Golin of Propaganda Films purchased it on June 12, 1998, for a low seven-figure sum. Kaufman, who was responsible for writing the screenplay, did not begin immediately, instead opting to suspend writing while he was working on Adaptation, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, and Human Nature, the last of which Gondry directed as his directorial debut. During this time, filmmaker Christopher Nolan released his film Memento, which similarly deals with memory. Due to the similarities, Kaufman became worried and tried to pull out of the project, but Golin made him complete it. During writing, the pitch's ownership changed several times resulting in Kaufman not having to deal with the studios until the end of the scriptwriting process. The final script made the studios nervous. Kaufman did not want to make the film a thriller and wanted to downplay the science fiction aspects of memory erasure, focusing on the relationship. He had an \"enormous struggle\" while writing the script, particularly encountering two problems: showing \"the memories, Joel's reactions to the memories, and Joel interacting with Clementine outside of the memories in the memories,\" and the fact that characters could refer in later scenes to already erased memories. Kaufman resolved the first problem by making Joel lucid and able to comment on his memories and solved the second by making the memories degrade instead of immediately erasing, with complete erasure occurring at awakening. Kaufman's original name for the screenplay was 18 words long, as he had wanted a title that \"you couldn't possibly fit on a marquee.\" He eventually decided on Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, a title originating from the 1717 poem Eloisa to Abelard by Alexander Pope."

        "title": "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind_Filming and post-production",
        "content": "The shooting of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind began in mid-January 2003 after six weeks of preparation, lasting for three months on a budget of $20 million mostly in and around New York City. The production crew recreated some key scenes, such as Joel's Rockville Centre apartment and the 1950s-style kitchen, in a New Jersey former U.S. Navy base. The shoot was difficult, sometimes shooting for seventeen hours per day in harsh environments. The shoot was challenging for cinematographer Ellen Kuras, due to the difficulty of filming Gondry's vision for the film, which aimed to \"blend location-shoot authenticity with unpredictable flashes of whimsy\". According to this vision, Gondry wanted available light used exclusively for the shoot. Kuras disagreed and worked around this idea by lighting the room instead of the actors and by hiding light bulbs around the set to increase light levels. Another issue the cinematographers encountered was that due to the frequent improvisation, the lack of marks and the few rehearsals completed, the cinematographers often did not know where the actors would be. Two handheld cameras filmed near 360-degree footage at all times, shooting 36,000 feet of film a day to deal with this. Gondry called back to the work of French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard by filming using wheelchairs as well as using sled and chariot dollies instead of traditional dollies. When using wheelchairs, the shot was not consistently smooth; however, as Kuras liked the aesthetic of the low-angle, wobbly movement, the final film contains the footage. The film used minimal CGI, with many effects accomplished in-camera, through forced perspectives, hidden space, spotlighting, unsynchronized sound, split focus and continuity editing. A notable example is the ocean washing away the house in Montauk; the production team accomplished this by building the corner of a house on the beach and allowing the tide to rise. Executing this effect was difficult, as the special team hired to place the set in the water refused due to perceived dangers. In response, Gondry fired the team and had the production team, including the actors and producers, place the set in the water. In retaliation for Gondry's actions, the chief of the union reprimanded Gondry in front of the crew. Kaufman rewrote some of the script during production; thus, several discrepancies exist between the production script and the final film. A fundamental difference is that in the production script, with the erasure of each memory, Clementine's behavior is increasingly robotic. In the final film, Winslet plays Clementine straight, and degradation of settings and the intrusion of settings upon each other establish memory degradation visually. Another script component that did not make it into the final film was the appearance of Naomi, Joel's girlfriend, played by Ellen Pompeo. Against Kaufman's insistence on Naomi's inclusion, the production team cut her already filmed scenes. Tracy Morgan was also cut from the film. Icelandic editor Vald\u00eds \u00d3skarsd\u00f3ttir edited the film, and she reportedly conflicted with Gondry during editing. Kaufman was also very involved in the editing of the film. Editing was a long process as there was no requirement to rush it. There were a few test screenings of the film, which elicited positive reactions."

The site's critical consensus reads, \"Propelled by Charlie Kaufman's smart, imaginative script and Michel Gondry's equally daring directorial touch, Eternal Sunshine is a twisty yet heartfelt look at relationships and heartache.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 89 out of 100, based on 41 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B-\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times in his initial 2004 review gave the film 3\u00bd out of a possible 4. He revisited the film in 2010 when he referred to Kaufman as \"the most gifted screenwriter of the 2000s\" and revised the rating to a full four stars, adding it to his \"Great Movies\" list. A. O. Scott of The New York Times praised the film for being \"cerebral, formally and conceptually complicated, dense with literary allusions and as unabashedly romantic as any movie you'll ever see\". Time Out summed up their review by saying, \"the formidable Gondry/Kaufman/Carrey axis works marvel after marvel in expressing the bewildering beauty and existential horror of being trapped inside one's own addled mind, and in allegorising the self-preserving amnesia of a broken but hopeful heart.\" Winslet and Carrey received acclaim for their performances. Winslet's performance as Clementine received multiple award nominations, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, a BAFTA nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role and a Golden Globe Award nomination. Premiere magazine placed her performance 81st in their 2008 list of the 100 Greatest Performances of All Time. Claudia Puig in a review for USA Today said of her performance \"Winslet is wonderful as a free spirit whose hair color changes along with her moods. She hasn't had such a meaty role in a while, and she plays it just right\". Ann Hornaday in a review for The Washington Post said \"Even when forced to wear costumes and wigs that make her look like Pippi Longstocking after an acid-fueled trip to the thrift market, Winslet maintains a reassuring equilibrium. It takes an actor of her steadiness to play someone this unhinged.\" Carrey's performance as Joel also received acclaim and multiple award nominations, including a BAFTA nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role and a Golden Globe Award nomination. Many reviewers noted his casting against type. Jason Killingsworth in a review for Paste magazine said of his performance \"Carrey nails the part, winning audience sympathy from the opening moments of the film\". Moira MacDonald in a review for The Seattle Times stated \"[Jim Carrey is] not bad at all \u2014 in fact, it's the most honest, vulnerable work he's ever done\", while David Edelstein of Slate said \"It's rarely a compliment when I refer to an actor as \"straitjacketed,\" but the straitjacketing of Jim Carrey is fiercely poignant. You see all that manic comic energy imprisoned in this ordinary man, with the anarchism peeking out and trying to find a way to express itself.\" The supporting cast also received acclaim, with several reviews, such as Ann Hornaday of the Washington Post and Rick Groen of The Globe and Mail singling out Ruffalo's performance for praise. Critics praised Kaufman and his ambition, and he won numerous awards for his efforts, including an Academy Award and a BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay. In Slate, David Edelstein claimed Kaufman had \"move[d] the boundary posts of romantic comedy,\" and Moira MacDonald of The Seattle Times called Kaufman \"one of the few creative screenwriters working today.\" Kaufman's writing also was the recipient of some criticism, with some, including John Powers of the LA Weekly, claiming it lacked passion and Andrew Sarris of Observer criticizing the film's \"nonexistent character development.\" Gondry, like Kaufman, also received large amounts of praise, with The Washington Post acclaiming \"the results [of Gondry using primarily live-action effects], in their intricate detail and execution,\" as \"nothing short of brilliant.\" The Seattle Times in their review stated \"Gondry ... makes it all a melancholy fun house, with camera work and visual tricks that rival the screenplay in invention.\" Cinematographer Ellen Kuras received praise for her work on the film, such as in a Salon magazine, where, in an overall negative review of the film, reviewer Stephanie Zacharek praised Kuras for her giving \"the movie a look of dreamy urgency that's perfect for the story.\""

Q analyzes the microchip, establishing it to be a copy of one designed to withstand an electromagnetic pulse, made by government contractor Zorin Industries. Bond visits Ascot Racecourse to observe the company's owner, Max Zorin. Sir Godfrey Tibbett, a racehorse trainer and MI6 agent, believes Zorin's horses, which win consistently, are drugged, although tests proved negative. Through Tibbett, Bond meets with French private detective Achille Aubergine, who informs Bond that Zorin is holding a horse sale later in the month. During their dinner at the Eiffel Tower, Aubergine is assassinated by Zorin's bodyguard May Day, who subsequently escapes. Bond and Tibbett travel to Zorin's estate for the horse sale. Bond notices a woman visiting Zorin, who has written her a cheque for $5 million. At night, Bond and Tibbett break into Zorin's laboratory, where he is implanting adrenaline-releasing devices in his horses. Zorin identifies Bond as an agent, has May Day assassinate Tibbett, and attempts to have Bond killed. General Gogol of the KGB confronts Zorin for killing Bond without permission, revealing that Zorin was initially trained and financed by the KGB but has now gone rogue. Later, Zorin unveils to a group of investors his plan to destroy Silicon Valley, which will give him\u2014and the potential investors\u2014a monopoly over microchip manufacture. Bond goes to San Francisco and meets with CIA agent Chuck Lee, who claims Zorin is the product of medical experimentation with steroids performed by Dr. Carl Mortner, a Nazi scientist who is now Zorin's veterinarian and racehorse-breeding consultant. Bond then investigates a nearby oil rig owned by Zorin, and while there finds KGB agent Pola Ivanova recording conversations and her partner placing explosives on the rig. Ivanova's partner is caught and killed, but Ivanova and Bond escape. Later Ivanova takes the recording, but finds that Bond had switched tapes. Bond tracks down State Geologist Stacey Sutton, the woman Zorin attempted to pay off, and discovers that Zorin is trying to buy her family oil business. The two travel to San Francisco City Hall to check Zorin's submitted plans. However, Zorin, who has been alerted to their presence, kills the Chief Geologist (Lee has already been killed earlier, in a manner similar to Tibbett), and sets fire to the building to frame Bond for the murder(s) and kill him at the same time. Bond and Stacey escape in a fire engine when the police try to arrest him. Bond and Stacey infiltrate Zorin's mine, discovering his plot to detonate explosives beneath the lakes along the Hayward and San Andreas faults, which will cause them to flood and submerge Silicon Valley forever. A larger bomb is also in the mine to destroy a \"geological lock\" that prevents the two faults from moving simultaneously. Once in place, Zorin and his security chief Scarpine flood the mines and kill the workers. Stacey escapes while Bond fights May Day; when she realizes Zorin abandoned her, she helps Bond remove the larger bomb, putting the device onto a handcar and riding it out of the mine, where it explodes and kills her. Escaping in his airship with Scarpine and Mortner, Zorin abducts Stacey while Bond grabs hold of the airship's mooring rope. Zorin tries to knock him off, but Bond manages to moor the airship to the framework of the Golden Gate Bridge. Stacey attacks Zorin to save Bond, and in the fracas, Mortner and Scarpine are temporarily knocked out. Stacey flees and joins Bond out on the bridge, but Zorin follows them out with an ax. The ensuing fight between Zorin and Bond culminates with Zorin falling to his death. Mortner attempts to attack Bond with dynamite, but Bond cuts the airship free, causing Mortner to drop the dynamite in the cabin, blowing up the airship and killing himself and Scarpine. General Gogol wishes to award Bond the Order of Lenin for foiling Zorin's scheme, but M reports that he is missing. At Stacey's home, Q sends a remote-controlled surveillance robot in to search the residence, whereupon it discovers Bond in the bathroom with Stacey."

        "content": "Along with the other stories in Ian Fleming's 1960 anthology For Your Eyes Only, the original short story \"From a View to a Kill\" was originally envisioned as an episode of an abandoned 1958 CBS James Bond television series. A View to a Kill was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson. Wilson also co-authored the screenplay along with Richard Maibaum. Broccoli initially wanted to rehire George MacDonald Fraser from Octopussy to co-write the screenplay but he was unavailable. Originally Maibaum's script included Zorin manipulating Halley's Comet into crashing into Silicon Valley, but Wilson insisted on a more realistic plot. At the end of Octopussy, the \"James Bond Will Return\" sequence listed the next film as \"From a View to a Kill\", the name of the original short story, but later the title was changed. When a company with a name similar to Zorin (the Zoran Corporation) was discovered in the United States, a disclaimer was added to the start of the film affirming that Zorin was not related to any real-life company. This is the first Bond film to have a disclaimer (The Living Daylights had a disclaimer about the use of the Red Cross)."

        "content": "Early publicity for the film in 1984 included an announcement that David Bowie would play Zorin. He initially accepted the role but later decided against it, saying \"I didn't want to spend five months watching my stunt double fall off cliffs.\" The role was then offered to Sting, who turned it down, and finally to Christopher Walken. Priscilla Presley was originally going to be cast as Stacey Sutton, but she had to be replaced by Tanya Roberts because of her contract with Dallas. The original script had Barbara Bach reprising her role as Major Anya Amasova from 1977's The Spy Who Loved Me. However, Bach declined the role, and so an entirely new character - Pola Ivanova - was created, played by Fiona Fullerton. Patrick Macnee, as Bond's ally Tibbett, became the fourth former star of The Avengers television series to appear in a Bond film, following Honor Blackman, Diana Rigg and Joanna Lumley. David Yip's character Chuck Lee was originally scripted as Felix Leiter, but he was rewritten into a new Asian-American character in order to capitalize on the setting of San Francisco. Dolph Lundgren has a brief appearance as one of General Gogol's KGB agents. Lundgren, who was dating Grace Jones at the time, was visiting her on set when one day an extra was missing, so the director John Glen then asked him if he wanted to attempt the role. Lundgren appears during the confrontation between Gogol and Zorin at the racetrack, standing several steps below Gogol."

        "content": "Principal photography began with the horse racing scenes at Ascot Racecourse on 1 August 1984. The film was shot at Pinewood Studios in London, Iceland, Switzerland, France and the United States with the budget initially being $35 million. Several French landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, its Jules Verne restaurant and the Ch\u00e2teau de Chantilly were filmed. The rest of the major filming was done at Fisherman's Wharf, Dunsmuir House, San Francisco City Hall and the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. The Lefty O'Doul Bridge was featured in the fire engine chase scene. Production of the film began on 23 June 1984 in Iceland, where the second unit filmed the pre-title sequence. On 27 June 1984, several leftover canisters of petrol used during filming of Ridley Scott's Legend caused Pinewood Studios' 007 Stage to burn to the ground. The stage was rebuilt, and reopened in January 1985 (renamed as Albert R. Broccoli's 007 Stage) for filming of A View to a Kill. Work had continued on other stages at Pinewood when Roger Moore rejoined the main unit there on 1 August 1984. The crew then departed for shooting the horse-racing scenes at Royal Ascot Racecourse. The scene in which Bond and Sutton enter the mineshaft was then filmed in a waterlogged quarry near Staines-upon-Thames and the Amberley Chalk Pits Museum in West Sussex. On 6 October 1984, the fourth unit, headed by special effects supervisor John Richardson, began its work on the climactic fight sequence. At first, only a few plates constructed to resemble the Golden Gate Bridge were used. Later that night, shooting of the burning San Francisco City Hall commenced. The first actual scenes atop the bridge were filmed on 7 October 1984. In Paris it was planned that two stunt parachutists, B.J. Worth and Don Caldvedt, would undertake two jumps from a (clearly visible) platform that extended from a top edge of the Eiffel Tower. However, sufficient footage was obtained from Worth's jump, so Caldvedt was told he would not be performing his own descent. Caldvedt, unhappy at not being able to perform the jump, parachuted off the tower without authorisation from the City of Paris. He was subsequently sacked by the production team for jeopardising the continuation of filming in the city. Airship Industries managed a major marketing coup with the inclusion of its Skyship 500 series blimp in the film. At the time Airship Industries was producing a fleet of blimps which were recognisable over many capitals of the world offering tours, or advertising sponsorship deals. As all Bond films have included the most current technology, this included the lighter than air interest. The blimp seen in the climax was then on a promotional tour of Los Angeles after its participation in the opening ceremony of the 1984 Summer Olympics. At that time, it had \"Welcome\" painted across the side of the gasbag, but was replaced by \"Zorin Industries\" for the film. During the summer of 1984, the blimp was used to advertise Fujifilm. In real life, inflating the airship would take up to 24 hours, but during the film it was shown to take two minutes. Despite filming going over schedule by two weeks, the production was completed $5 million under budget at $30 million according to John Glen. Filming completed on 16 January 1985."

The 2015 track Writing's on the Wall later out performed the song in the UK by reaching number one. Duran Duran was chosen to do the song after bassist John Taylor, a lifelong Bond fan, approached producer Albert Broccoli at a party, and somewhat drunkenly asked \"When are you going to get someone decent to do one of your theme songs?\" During the opening sequence, a cover version of the 1965 Beach Boys song \"California Girls\", performed by tribute band Gidea Park with Adrian Baker, is used during a chase in which Bond snowboards; it has been suggested that this sequence helped initiate interest in snowboarding."

        "content": "This was the first Bond film with a premiere outside the UK, opening on 22 May 1985 at San Francisco's Palace of Fine Arts. The British premiere was held on 12 June 1985 at the Odeon Leicester Square cinema in London. It achieved a box office gross of US$152.4 million worldwide with $50.3 million from the United States and Canada. On its opening weekend in the US and Canada it grossed $13.3 million from 1,583 theaters over the four-day Memorial Day weekend, the biggest opening for a Bond film ever at the time, but not enough to beat Rambo: First Blood Part II which was number one for the weekend with a gross of $25.2 million from 2,074 theaters. Although its box office reception was excellent, the film's critical response was mostly mixed. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 38% based on reviews from 60 critics, which is the lowest rating for the Eon-produced Bond films on the website. On Metacritic the film has a score of 40% based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". One of the most common criticisms was that Roger Moore was 57 at the time of filming \u2013 and had visibly aged in the two years that had passed since Octopussy. The Washington Posts critic said \"Moore isn't just long in the tooth\u2014he's got tusks, and what looks like an eye job has given him the pie-eyed blankness of a zombie. He's not believable anymore in the action sequences, even less so in the romantic scenes\u2014it's like watching women fall all over Gabby Hayes.\" Sean Connery declared that \"Bond should be played by an actor 35, 33 years old. I'm too old. Roger's too old, too!\" In a December 2007 interview, Roger Moore remarked, \"I was only about four hundred years too old for the part.\" Moore also said that, at the time, A View to a Kill was his least favourite Bond film, and mentioned that he was mortified to find out that he was older than his female co-star's mother. He was quoted as saying \"I was horrified on the last Bond I did. Whole slews of sequences where Christopher Walken was machine-gunning hundreds of people. I said 'That wasn't Bond, those weren't Bond films.' It stopped being what they were all about. You didn't dwell on the blood and the brains spewing all over the place\". Pauline Kael of The New Yorker said \"The James Bond series has had its bummers, but nothing before in the class of A View to a Kill. You go to a Bond picture expecting some style or, at least, some flash, some lift; you don't expect the dumb police-car crashes you get here. You do see some ingenious daredevil feats, but they're crowded together and, the way they're set up, they don't give you the irresponsible, giddy tingle you're hoping for.\" Kael also singled out the dispirited direction and the hopeless script. \"Director John Glen stages the slaughter scenes so apathetically that the picture itself seems dissociated. (I don't think I've ever seen another movie in which race horses were mistreated and the director failed to work up any indignation. If Glen has any emotions about what he puts on the screen, he keeps them to himself.)\" Lawrence O'Toole of Maclean's believed it was one of the series' best entries. \"Of all the modern formulas in the movie industry, the James Bond series is among the most pleasurable and durable. Lavish with their budgets, the producers also bring a great deal of craft, wit and a sense of fun to the films. Agent 007 is like an old friend who an audience meets for drinks every two years or so; he regales them with tall tales, winking all the time. The 14th and newest Bond epic, A View to a Kill, is an especially satisfying encounter. Opening with a breathtaking ski chase in Siberia, A View to a Kill is the fastest Bond picture yet. Its pace has the precision of a Swiss watch and the momentum of a greyhound on the track. There is a spectacular chase up and down the Eiffel Tower and through Paris streets, which Bond finishes in a severed car on just two wheels. But none of the action prepares the viewer for the heart-stopping climax with Zorin's dirigible tangled in the cables on top of San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge.\" And although O'Toole believed that Moore was showing his age in the role, \"there are plenty of tunes left in his violin. James Bond is still a virtuoso, with a licence to thrill.\" Brian J. Arthurs of The Beach Reporter said it was the worst film of the Bond series. Chris Peachment of the Time Out Film Guide said \"Grace Jones is badly wasted.\" Norman Wilner of MSN chose it as the worst Bond film, while IGN picked it as the fourth worst, and Entertainment Weekly as the fifth-worst. Danny Peary had mixed feelings about A View to a Kill but was generally complimentary: \"Despite what reviewers automatically reported, [Moore] looks trimmer and more energetic than in some of the previous efforts\u00a0... I wish Bond had a few more of his famous gadgets on hand, but his action scenes are exciting and some of the stunt work is spectacular. Walken's the first Bond villain who is not so much an evil person as a crazed neurotic. I find him more memorable than some of the more recent Bond foes\u00a0... Unfortunately, the filmmakers \u2013 who ruined villain Jaws by making him a nice guy in Moonraker \u2013 make the mistake of switching May Day at the end from Bond's nemesis to his accomplice, depriving us of a slam-bang fight to the finish between the two (I suppose gentleman Bond isn't allowed to kill women, even a monster like May Day)\u00a0... [The film] lacks the flamboyance of earlier Bond films, and has a terrible slapstick chase sequence in San Francisco, but overall it's fast-paced, fairly enjoyable, and a worthy entry in the series.\" Also among the more positive reviews was Movie Freaks 365s Kyle Bell: \"Good ol' Roger gave it his best.\u00a0... Whether you can get past the absurdity of the storyline, you can't really deny that it has stunning stunt work and lots of action. It's an entertaining movie that could have been better.\" Walken was also praised by online critic Christopher Null for portraying a \"classic Bond villain\". Bond historian John Brosnan believed A View to a Kill was Moore's best Bond entry. He said Moore looked in better shape than the previous Bond film, Octopussy. Brosnan, an airship enthusiast, especially admired the dirigible finale. Neil Gaiman reviewed A View to a Kill for Imagine magazine, and stated that \"When Grace Jones went to bed with Moore, I was sure the producers had hit upon a way to kill the old fellow off with dignity, but when Bond was seen wandering around fresh as a daisy the next morning I realised how escapist this all is. Unless he just rolled over and went to sleep, of course, which is what I was strongly tempted to do.\" Roberts was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award as Worst Actress, but she lost the trophy to Linda Blair, who appeared in Night Patrol, Savage Island and Savage Streets."

The film is about an Eastern European man who is stuck in New York's John F. Kennedy Airport terminal when he is denied entry to the United States and at the same time is unable to return to his native country because of a military coup. The film is partially inspired by the true story of the 18-year stay of Mehran Karimi Nasseri in Terminal 1 of Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport, France, from 1988 to 2006. After finishing his previous film, Catch Me If You Can, Spielberg decided to direct The Terminal because he wanted to next make a film \"that could make us laugh and cry and feel good about the world\". Due to a lack of suitable airports willing to provide their facilities for the production, an entire working set was built inside a large hangar at the LA/Palmdale Regional Airport, with most of the film's exterior shots taken from the Montr\u00e9al\u2013Mirabel International Airport. The film was released in North America on June 18, 2004 to mildly positive reviews and was a commercial success, earning $219 million worldwide."

        "content": "Viktor Navorski, a traveler from the fictional country of Krakozhia, arrives at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, only to discover that his passport is not valid. The United States does not recognize Krakozhia's new government after a coup, and Viktor is not permitted to either enter the country or return home as his passport is no longer considered valid. Because of this, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seizes his passport and return ticket pending resolution of the issue. He becomes a refugee and is forced to live at Kennedy International Airport. Frank Dixon, the Acting Field Commissioner of the airport, instructs Viktor to stay in the transit lounge until the issue is resolved. Viktor settles in at the terminal with only his luggage and a Planters peanut can. Viktor finds a gate currently under renovation, and makes it his home. All the while, Dixon is determined to get Viktor out of the airport and make him someone else's problem. He tries to get Viktor to leave by luring him out of the airport by ordering guards away from the exit for 5 minutes but it fails. Dixon then tries to get Viktor to claim asylum so he can leave the airport but it also fails due to Viktor's poor English. Meanwhile, Viktor befriends and assists several airport employees and travelers. Among them is a flight attendant named Amelia Warren, whom he sees periodically and tries to woo, after she mistakes him for a building contractor who is frequently traveling. Dixon, who is being considered for a promotion, becomes more and more obsessed with getting rid of Viktor. In the meantime, Viktor begins reading books and magazines to learn English. After he impulsively remodels a wall in the renovation zone, he is hired by an airport contractor and paid under the table. One day, Dixon pulls Amelia aside and questions her regarding Viktor and his mysterious peanut can. Amelia, who realizes Viktor has not been entirely truthful, confronts him at his makeshift home, where he shows her that the Planters peanut can contains a copy of the \"A Great Day in Harlem\" photograph. His late father was a jazz enthusiast who had discovered the famous portrait in a Hungarian newspaper in 1958, and vowed to collect the autographs of all 57 of the musicians featured on it. He died before he could get the last one, from tenor saxophonist Benny Golson. Viktor has come to New York to do so. After hearing the story, Amelia kisses Viktor. After nine months, his friends wake Viktor with the news that the war in Krakozhia has ended, and he can get a green stamp, allowing him to leave the airport. Meanwhile, Amelia had asked her \"friend\", actually a married government official with whom she had been having an affair, to get Viktor a one-day emergency visa to fulfil his dream, but Viktor is disappointed to learn she has rekindled her relationship with the man during this process. When he presents the emergency visa at customs, Viktor is told that Dixon must sign the visa. But with Viktor's passport now valid again, Dixon is determined to immediately send him back to Krakozhia. He threatens Viktor that if he does not go home at once, he will cause trouble for his friends, most seriously by deporting janitor Gupta Rajan back to India to face a charge of assaulting a police officer. Unwilling to let this happen, Viktor finally agrees to return home. When Gupta learns of this, however, he runs in front of the plane which would take Viktor back home, ensuring his deportation and taking the burden off Viktor. The delay gives Viktor enough time to get into the city. Dixon orders his officers to arrest Viktor, but disillusioned with Dixon, they let him leave the airport. As Viktor is getting in a taxi, Amelia arrives in another taxi, and they briefly smile and make eye contact. Dixon himself arrives at the taxi stand only moments after Viktor's taxi left. When his officers arrive and one suggests immediately cordoning off the area and searching all vehicles to find him, Dixon pauses for a moment before telling them that they have incoming travelers to handle. Viktor arrives in New York at the hotel where Benny Golson is performing and finally collects the last autograph. He gets in a taxi, telling the driver, \"I am going home.\""

        "content": "Some have noted that the film appears to be inspired by the story of Mehran Karimi Nasseri, also known as Sir Alfred, an Iranian refugee who lived in Terminal One of the Charles de Gaulle airport, Paris from 1988 when his refugee papers were stolen until 2006 when he was hospitalized for unspecified ailments. In September 2003, The New York Times noted that Spielberg bought the rights to Nasseri's life story as the basis for the film; and in September 2004 The Guardian noted Nasseri received thousands of dollars from the filmmakers. However, none of the studio's publicity materials mention Nasseri's story as an inspiration for the film. The 1993 French film Lost in Transit was already based on the same story. In deciding to make the film, Steven Spielberg stated that after directing Catch Me If You Can, \"I wanted to do another movie that could make us laugh and cry and feel good about the world.... This is a time when we need to smile more and Hollywood movies are supposed to do that for people in difficult times.\" Spielberg traveled around the world to find an actual airport that would let him film for the length of the production, but could not find one. The Terminal set was built in a massive hangar at the LA/Palmdale Regional Airport. The hangar, part of the U.S. Air Force Plant 42 complex was used to build the Rockwell International B-1B bomber. The set was built to full earthquake construction codes and was based on D\u00fcsseldorf Airport. The shape of both the actual terminal and the set viewed sideways is a cross section of an aircraft wing. Because of this design, the film was one of the first to use the Spidercam for film production. The camera, most often used for televised sports, allowed Spielberg the ability to create sweeping shots across the set. The design of the set for The Terminal, as noted by Roger Ebert in his reviews and attested by Spielberg himself in a feature by Empire magazine, was greatly inspired by Jacques Tati's classic film PlayTime. Hanks based his characterization of Viktor Navorski on his father-in-law Allan Wilson, a Bulgarian immigrant, who according to Hanks can speak \"Russian, Turkish, Polish, Greek, little bit of Italian, little bit of French\", in addition to his native Bulgarian. Hanks also had some help from a Bulgarian translator named Peter Budevski."

Scott of The New York Times said Hanks' performance brought a lot to the film. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave The Terminal three-and-a-half out of four stars, stating that \"This premise could have yielded a film of contrivance and labored invention. Spielberg, his actors and writers... weave it into a human comedy that is gentle and true, that creates sympathy for all of its characters, that finds a tone that will carry them through, that made me unreasonably happy\". Martin Liebman of Blu-ray.com considers the film as \"quintessential cinema\", praising it for being \"a down-to-earth, honest, hopeful, funny, moving, lightly romantic, and dramatically relevant film that embodies the term 'movie magic' in every scene.\" For critic Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com, he regards The Terminal alongside War of the Worlds and Munich (also directed by Spielberg) as the three best films made within the studio system that comment upon the September 11 attacks."

The exact location of Krakozhia is kept intentionally vague in the film, sticking with the idea of Viktor being simply Eastern European or from a former Soviet republic. However, in one scene, a map of Krakozhia is briefly displayed on one of the airport's television screens during a news report on the ongoing conflict and its borders are those of present-day North Macedonia (then known as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia at the time of the film's production and release due to the then-ongoing Macedonia naming dispute). However, in another scene, the protagonist shows his driver's license, which happens to be a Belarusian license issued to a woman bearing an Uzbek name. The film presents a reasonably accurate picture of the process of naturalistic second-language acquisition, according to linguist Martha Young-Scholten. John Williams, the film's composer, also wrote a national anthem for Krakozhia. Tom Hanks' character speaks the Bulgarian language as his native Krakozhian, but in one scene, in which he helps a Russian-speaking passenger with a customs-related issue, he speaks a constructed Slavic language resembling both Bulgarian and Russian. When the protagonist buys a guide book of New York both in English and in his mother tongue in order to compare the two versions and improve his English, the book he studies is written in Russian."

A portion of the clip is set to Jackson's song \"Speed Demon\". After filming \"Badder\", Little Michael and his bodyguards (also young kids) are leaving the set and walk through a cloud of smoke and come out as their regular adult age. As he exits the set, he is spotted by tourists and they suddenly begin to chase him for an autograph. In an attempt to avoid the overzealous fans and the interviewers (including camera-happy Japanese tourists accompanied by stereotyped \"Oriental\" music, the press, and even The Noid) plus some gunslingers (after stumbling upon the filming of a Western helmed by a director resembling Steven Spielberg), Jackson soon disguises himself as a rabbit named Spike, using a costume from one of the film sets (imbued with animatronic properties using Claymation, giving a similar combined-media effect as Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but with more obvious bluescreening), but ends up taunting the fans into chasing him once they realize it is him.  Michael steals a bicycle which then turns into a motorcycle once he hits the highway in order to flee, with the fans and paparazzi (now also appearing in Claymation form) giving chase in various other, more cartoonish vehicles. During the chase, he morphs into other celebrities, namely Sylvester Stallone, Tina Turner and Pee-wee Herman, with the bike also briefly morphing (into a jackhammer, stop sign, waterski, and jet pack) in repeatedly unsuccessful attempts to throw the fans off. After a long chase, the fans/press are finally thwarted by crashing into a giant (Claymation) cop and are arrested. Michael finally then manages to escape and rides off to a desert. He takes off his rabbit costume and it then suddenly comes to life and challenges him to an extended dance-off. In the end, a passing traffic cop interrupts Michael to point out he is in a \"No Dancing Zone\", and when Michael turns to show him that he was competing with the rabbit, he sees that the rabbit has disappeared. The cop then sarcastically asks for Michael's autograph (as opposed to \"signature\") on the ticket. Just as Michael is preparing to leave, the rabbit's head materializes on a nearby rocky crag, which then nods to him and smiles."

It is meant to point out, in a mocking tone, the way the tabloids unnecessarily sensationalized his life with claims that he had a shrine to Elizabeth Taylor and bought the Elephant Man's bones. In the video, Jackson's life is portrayed as a circus due to the press's manipulation and the everyday tug-of-war he endured as an artist. His beloved then-pet chimp Bubbles makes a cameo appearance as Jackson is seen picking him up and riding with him in his roller coaster car. His pet snake, Muscles, is also present. The press is portrayed with dog heads to insinuate that they are like animals. The segment ends with Jackson destroying the park, and looking off into space."

The film then backtracks to show Michael and the children playing in a meadow in happier times. As they're playing, their dog Skipper runs away, and as Michael and Katie look for him they uncover the lair of Mr. Big, whose real name Frankie Lideo is an allusion to Frank DiLeo (Michael Jackson's then-manager), is a drug-dealing mobster with an army of henchmen. He wants to get the entire population of Earth addicted to drugs, starting with children. As Mr. Big continues work on his operation, he discovers that Michael and Katie are spying on his operation. The story returns to the ambush in front of Michael's apartment. Unknown to the gangsters, Michael wished on the falling star and escaped the gunfire, leaving only his jacket. Upon realizing he has escaped again, Mr. Big orders his henchmen to track down Michael with dogs. He is eventually cornered in an alley, where he wishes on another falling star and turns into a Lancia Stratos Zero sports car that mows down several of Mr. Big's henchmen. Michael is pursued through the city streets until he loses the henchmen. Meanwhile, the children scout out Club 30s, where Michael had told them to meet him, and find only an abandoned nightclub. As Michael arrives, Katie sees a silhouette of him turning back from a car into himself. The door of the club opens with a gust of wind, and Michael walks in to find it filled with zoot suiters and swing dancers. The children gather outside a window of the club and watch Michael dance to \"Smooth Criminal.\" Mr. Big lays siege to the club and kidnaps Katie. Michael follows them back to Big's lair and ends up surrounded by his henchmen. Mr. Big appears and taunts Michael by threatening to inject Katie with highly addictive narcotics. While Katie manages to wriggle free, Mr. Big decides he's had enough and orders his men to kill Katie before finishing off Michael, but not before a falling star flies by. Michael transforms into a giant robot and kills all of Mr. Big's soldiers, then turns into a spaceship. Mr. Big gets into a large hillside-mounted energy cannon, firing on the spaceship knocking it into a nearby ravine. The children are his next target, but the spaceship returns from the ravine in time to fire a beam in the cannon with Mr. Big inside. The children watch the ship fly into the night sky with a shower of light."

In 1989, Moonwalker was honoured with a certification of 800,000 copies sold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Moonwalker has been certified 9 x Platinum in the United Kingdom.

This top-down action game followed the segments of the film and bore little resemblance to the latter, more popular games developed by Sega with Michael Jackson's cooperation.Moonwalker was developed into an arcade video game by Sega with the help of Jackson, which was released on the Sega System 18 hardware. A distinct adaptation was also developed for Sega's Genesis/Mega Drive and Master System home video game systems. The console versions of the game were actually based on an evolved version of the side-scrolling Sega Mega Drive Shinobi series engine, while the arcade version was a three-quarters beat 'em up. Both the console and arcade versions are based on the \"Smooth Criminal\" segment of the film, following Michael in suit and fedora through stages based on his different music videos as he rescues children from the drug dealer Mr. Big. In the three-player simultaneous arcade game, contact with Bubbles, Michael's chimp, transformed him into a robot warrior, replacing Michael's \"star magic\" and melee dance attacks with missiles and laser beams. In the console versions on certain levels, rescuing a certain child first would trigger a comet to fall from the sky that could be grabbed transforming Michael into the robot (which could fly with a rocket pack as well as using lasers and a missile special attack). Michael automatically changes into a robot for the final showdown with Mr. Big's henchmen and finally into a space ship for the last battle, in a sort of flight-sim shooter in the Genesis/Mega Drive version. All incarnations of the game featured the ability of Michael to use some form of \"Dance Magic\" which would force his enemies to dance to the music of various tunes from \"Bad\" or \"Thriller\" and be destroyed as a result."

        "content": "Kemmons Wilson, a resident of Memphis, Tennessee, was inspired to build a motel after being disappointed by the poor quality of roadside accommodations during a family road trip to Washington, D.C. During construction, the name \"Holiday Inn\" was coined by Wilson's architect Eddie Bluestein as a joking reference to the 1942 musical film Holiday Inn. Their first hotel/motel opened in August 1952 as \"Holiday Inn Hotel Courts\" at 4941 Summer Avenue in Memphis, then the main highway (U.S. Hwy. 64/70/79) to Nashville. It was demolished in 1994. Wilson partnered with Wallace E. Johnson to build additional motels on the roads entering Memphis. In 1953, three more Holiday Inns were built on U.S. 51 South, Highway 51 North, and U.S. 61. By 1957 there were 30 Holiday Inns, and Wilson began marketing the chain as \"Holiday Inn of America\". There were 50 locations across the US by 1958, 100 by 1959, 500 by 1964, and 1000 in 1968. In 1965, the chain launched Holidex, a centralized reservation system where a visitor to any Holiday Inn could obtain reservations, by teleprinter, for any other Holiday Inn location. Promoting itself as \"your host from coast to coast\", Holiday Inn added a call center after AT&T's introduction of 800 toll-free telephone number service in 1967, and updated its systems as desktop microcomputers found their way into travel agencies. Branded as \"The Nation's Innkeeper\", the chain put considerable financial pressure on traditional motels and hotels, setting the standard for competitors like Ramada Inn, Quality Inn, Howard Johnson's, and Best Western. By June 1972, with over 1,400 Holiday Inns worldwide, Wilson was featured on the cover of Time magazine and the franchise's motto became \"The World's Innkeeper\". In the 1960s, Holiday Inn began franchising and opening campgrounds under the Holiday Inn Trav-L-Park brand. These recreational campgrounds were listed in the Holiday Inn directories. In 1963, Holiday Inn signed a long-term deal with Gulf Oil Corporation where it agreed to accept Gulf credit cards to charge food and lodging at all of its American and Canadian hotels, in return for Gulf building service stations on many Holiday Inn properties, particularly near major U.S. and Interstate highways. The arrangement was copied by competing lodging chains and major oil companies during the mid-to-late 1960s, but fell out of favor following the 1973 oil crisis. The Gulf/Holiday Inn arrangement ended around 1982. In 1971, the company constructed the Holiday Inn University and Conference Center, a teaching hotel for training new employees, in Olive Branch, Mississippi. In 1973, the company built the Olive Branch Airport north of the university as a home base for its corporate aircraft. The company later branched into other enterprises, including Medi-Center nursing homes, Continental Trailways, Delta Queen, and Show-Biz, Inc., a television production company that specialized in syndicated country music shows. Wilson also developed the Orange Lake Resort and Country Club near Orlando and a chain called Wilson World Hotels. The company sold Trailways in 1979.  As of 2014, Wilson's family still operates hotels as part of the Kemmons Wilson Companies of Memphis."

It was perhaps the company's most successful form of advertising. It was extremely large and eye-catching, but was expensive to construct and operate. The manufacturer of the sign was Balton & Sons Sign Company, and it was originally designed by sketch artists Gene Barber and Roland Alexander. Wilson wanted a prominent sign, desiring that it be at least 50 feet (15\u00a0m) high and visible in both directions. He also wanted a changeable marquee to welcome different groups. The original sign cost $13,000. It is said that the sign's colors were selected because they were favorites of Wilson's mother. In 1982, following Wilson's departure, the Holiday Inn board of directors phased out the \"Great Sign\" in favor of a cheaper back-lit sign; Wilson considered it \"the worst mistake they ever made\". He loved the \"Great Sign\" so much that it was engraved on his tombstone, with the marquee reading \"FOUNDER\" and the arrow aimed at his name. The majority of the signs were scrapped but working examples are owned by the American Sign Museum in Cincinnati, Ohio and The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, and with a private collector in Park Hills, Kentucky."

Holiday Inns, Inc. was renamed \"Holiday Corporation\" in 1985 to reflect the growth of the company's brands, including Harrah's Entertainment, Embassy Suites Hotels, Crowne Plaza, Homewood Suites, and Hampton Inn. In 1988, Holiday Corporation was purchased by UK-based Bass PLC (then owners of the Bass beer brand), followed by the remaining domestic Holiday Inn hotels in 1990, when founder Wilson sold his interest, after which the hotel group was known as Holiday Inn Worldwide. The remainder of Holiday Corporation (including the Embassy Suites Hotels, Homewood Suites, and Hampton Inn brands) was spun off to shareholders as Promus Companies Incorporated. In 1990, Bass launched Holiday Inn Express, a complementary brand in the limited service segment. In 1997, Bass created and launched a new hotel brand, Staybridge Suites by Holiday Inn, entering the North American upscale extended stay market. In March 1998, Bass acquired the InterContinental brand, expanding into the luxury hotel market. In 2000 Bass sold its brewing assets (and the rights to the Bass name) and changed its name to Six Continents PLC. InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) was created in 2003 after Six Continents split into two daughter companies: Mitchells & Butlers PLC to handle restaurant assets, and IHG to focus on soft drinks and hotels, including the Holiday Inn brand. The brand name Holiday Inn is now owned by IHG, which in turn licenses the name to franchisees and third parties who operate hotels under management agreements. In 1999, the hotel that changed into the Nickelodeon Suites Resort Orlando in 2005, opened, called \"Holiday Inn\". The Wall Street Journal reported in 2002 that the company, led by Ravi Saligram, was producing a new 130-room \"Next Generation\" prototype hotel to rebuild the brand. It would include a bistro-like restaurant and an indoor pool. The first of these prototype hotels, the Holiday Inn Gwinnett Center, was built in Duluth, Georgia, in 2003. On October 24, 2007, IHG announced a worldwide relaunch of the Holiday Inn brand, which spelled trouble for the remaining motels. The relaunch was \"focused on delivering consistently best in class service and physical quality levels, including a redesigned welcome experience [and] signature bedding and bathroom products\". The first relaunched Holiday Inn opened in the U.S. in spring 2008. Currently there are more than 2,500 relaunched Holiday Inn brand hotels around the world, and the Holiday Inn global brand relaunch process was completed by the end of 2010. By then, the majority of the HI motels were removed from the chain, with a few exceptions. (In the 1980s and 1990s, HI hotels were built alongside the motel properties [i.e. Baton Rouge, Louisiana] in order to provide more amenities and newer rooms.) When the relaunch occurred, these motels were either demolished or closed off, even if a full-service hotel was already on site. Today, fewer than 10 Holiday Inn motels still operate, others having been replaced by newer Holiday Inn Express locations or having switched to other chains. In September 2008, IHG announced the creation of a new timeshare brand, Holiday Inn Club Vacations, a strategic alliance with The Family of Orange Lake Resorts. In August 2012, the chain celebrated its 60th anniversary."

Holiday Inn ExpressThese properties originally focused on economy and limited service, very similar to competitors like Comfort Inn/Comfort Suites, Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott and Hampton by Hilton, providing only continental breakfast and an exercise room. However newer Holiday Inn Express do feature most amenities from the higher-end Holiday Inn brand, such a restaurant and bar, conference rooms, and even a full fitness center with a swimming pool.

In 2006, an agreement between IHG and the Niagara Falls, Ontario hotel owners was reached that allowed both the Hotel and Holidayinn.com to be incorporated into the IHG system. During the 1960s and early 1970s, Holiday Inn hotels located in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina were simply called \"Holiday\" because a local motel already had the \"Holiday Inn\" name. The Myrtle Beach motel started as Ocean Front Lodge in 1948 but changed the name to Holiday Inn in 1949 (three years before the founding of the chain), and put up a sign in 1955 with similar lettering to that of the chain, which registered its sign in 1954. The chain first franchised motels in the area in 1956. The Myrtle Beach hotel put up a sign resembling the \"Great Sign\" in 1968, and used \"\u00ae\" with its name, though many of its items came from suppliers which assumed they were selling to the chain. The Myrtle Beach hotel \"began a concurrent use proceeding in the Patent and Trademark Office\" in 1970, which was suspended when the name was contested before the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina (Florence division) in 1973. The court said the Myrtle Beach hotel had plenty of repeat business and was not negatively impacted by the chain's motels in the area. The 1973 injunction meant the Myrtle Beach hotel was granted the right to use the name but with a different style of lettering. The concurrent use proceeding resumed for the Myrtle Beach hotel, which continued to operate as \"Holiday Inn\", although it was required to use a distinctly different font. A 1976 ruling granted the Myrtle Beach Hotel the right to a service mark. A 1979 order denied a motion to modify the 1973 injunction, though it was believed the hotel had followed all restrictions. A 1981 decision by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the 1979 action."

        "content": "First Blood (also known as Rambo: First Blood) is a 1982 American action film directed by Ted Kotcheff, and co-written by Sylvester Stallone, who also stars as Vietnam War veteran John Rambo. It co-stars Richard Crenna as Rambo's mentor Sam Trautman and Brian Dennehy as Sheriff Will Teasle. It is the first installment in the Rambo franchise, followed by Rambo: First Blood Part II. The film is based on the 1972 novel First Blood by David Morrell, which many directors and studios had unsuccessfully attempted to adapt in the 1970s. In the film, Rambo is a troubled and misunderstood Vietnam veteran who must rely on his combat and survival skills when a series of brutal events results in him having to survive a massive manhunt by police and government troops near the small town of Hope, Washington. First Blood was released in the United States on October 22, 1982. Initial reviews were mixed, but the film was a box office success, grossing $156 million at the box office. In 1985, it also became the first Hollywood blockbuster to be released in China, holding the record for the largest number of tickets sold for an American film until 2018. Since its release, it has been reappraised by critics, with many highlighting the roles of Stallone, Dennehy, and Crenna, and recognizing it as an influential film in the action genre. Its success spawned a franchise, consisting of four sequels (co-written by and starring Stallone), an animated television series, a comic books series, a novel series, several video games, and a Bollywood remake."

        "content": "Vietnam War veteran John Rambo makes his way to the outskirts of a small town called Hope, Washington, in search of an old comrade, only to learn that his friend had died the previous year of cancer, brought on by exposure to Agent Orange during the war. Entering the town, Rambo is intercepted by the local sheriff, Will Teasle, who immediately takes a disliking to Rambo due to his unkempt hair, army jacket and generally messy appearance. Teasle however, offers Rambo a lift to \"make sure he is headed in the right direction\". When Rambo, now in Teasle's car, asks for directions to a diner, Teasle tells him that there's a diner 30 miles up the highway. Teasle then drives Rambo to the outskirts of the town before dropping him off and telling him that Portland, where Rambo had initially said he was headed, lies straight ahead. As Teasle drives off headed back into the town, he spots Rambo trying to return. Infuriated, Teasle arrests Rambo on charges of vagrancy, resisting arrest, and possessing a concealed knife before bringing him to the police station. Led by the sadistic chief deputy Art Galt, Teasle's officers abuse Rambo, triggering flashbacks of the torture he endured as a POW in Vietnam. When they try to dry-shave him with a straight razor, Rambo snaps. He overwhelms the patrolmen, takes back his knife, fights his way out of the station, steals a motorcycle, and flees into the woods. Teasle organizes a search party with automatic weapons, dogs, and a helicopter. Having spotted Rambo attempting to climb down a cliff over a creek, Galt defies Teasle's orders and attempts to shoot Rambo from the helicopter. Realizing that he is an open target, Rambo leaps from the cliff and lands on a tree branch, injuring his right arm. With Galt still shooting at him, Rambo throws a rock at the helicopter with his uninjured arm, cracking its windshield and causing the pilot to briefly lose control. Galt, who had removed his safety harness in order to get a better firing angle, loses his balance and falls to his death on the rocks below. With the aid of a pair of binoculars, Teasle identifies Galt's dead body at the bottom of the cliff, just beside the creek. Rambo tries to persuade Teasle and his men that Galt's death was an accident and that he wants no more trouble, but the officers hit him with a non-lethal shot, and force him to flee once more. Teasle swears revenge. It is later revealed that Rambo is an ex-Green Beret and recipient of the Medal of Honor, but Teasle, bent on revenge, arrogantly refuses to turn the manhunt over to the State Police. Using guerrilla tactics, Rambo non-lethally subdues the deputies, using improvised booby traps and his bare hands, until only Teasle is left. Overpowering Teasle and holding a knife to his throat, Rambo threatens to \"give him a war he won't believe\" if Teasle does not give up the pursuit, before retreating further into the woods. The State Police and Washington National Guard are brought in to assist Teasle, along with Rambo's mentor and former commanding officer, Colonel Sam Trautman. Confirming that Rambo's time in Vietnam allowed him to become an expert at guerrilla warfare and wilderness survival, Trautman advises that Rambo be allowed to escape to the next town in order to defuse the situation, then be permitted to surrender peacefully later. Confident that Rambo is hopelessly outnumbered, Teasle adamantly refuses. He allows Trautman to contact Rambo, who is using a stolen police radio, and try to persuade him to give himself up. Rambo recognizes Trautman but refuses to come in, condemning Teasle and his deputies for their abuse and noting that \"they drew first blood\". Trying to slip through the cordon, Rambo is surprised by a young boy out hunting; he overpowers but does not harm the boy, who alerts the authorities. A National Guard detachment corners Rambo at the entrance of an abandoned mine. Against Teasle's orders to wait for him, the inexperienced guardsmen use a rocket, collapsing the entrance and seemingly killing Rambo. He survives and finds another way out, hijacking a supply truck carrying an M60 machine gun and ammunition and returning to town. To distract his pursuers, Rambo blows up a gas station, shoots out most of the town's power, and destroys a gun store near the police station. Trautman, knowing that the sheriff is outmatched, tries again to convince Teasle to leave Rambo be, but the sheriff ignores him and goes to kill Rambo himself. Rambo spots Teasle on the police station's roof, and the two engage in a brief gunfight that ends with Teasle being shot and falling through a skylight. As Rambo prepares to kill him, Trautman appears and warns Rambo that he will be killed if he does not surrender, reminding him he is the last survivor of his elite unit of Green Berets. Now cornered, Rambo rages about the horrors of war before collapsing in tears and talking about his traumatic experiences: watching his friends die in Vietnam, being unable to hold a job due to his PTSD, the cruel treatment he received from his fellow Americans when he came home, and being forgotten by the country that he sacrificed so much for. Teasle is taken to a hospital, while Rambo, after being comforted and validated by Trautman, surrenders and is taken into federal custody."

        "content": "In 1972, Lawrence Turman at Columbia Pictures bought the film rights to First Blood for $175,000. Richard Brooks was slated to direct, and intended to have the film be an allegory on differing American perceptions of World War II and Vietnam War veterans, with Sheriff Teasle portrayed more sympathetically than in the novel. The film would have ended with Teasle ordering his men to drop their guns to try to reason with Rambo, who would have then been fatally shot by an unknown assailant. Brooks planned to start shooting First Blood in New Mexico in December 1972. The film did not proceed because the Vietnam War was still underway and Brooks left the project. Afterward, John Calley purchased the rights at Warner Bros. Pictures for $125,000 with the thought of casting either Robert De Niro or Clint Eastwood as Rambo. A screenplay was written by Walter Newman with Martin Ritt intended to direct. The film would have criticized American military culture and portrayed Colonel Trautman as the film's villain, ending with both Rambo and Teasle dying. Sydney Pollack and Martin Bregman also considered directing the film, with Bregman hiring David Rabe to write a script. After Bregman departed Mike Nichols considered directing Rabe's script. William Sackheim and Michael Kozoll wrote the screenplay that would be the basis of the final film in 1977, originally intending for John Badham to direct. Producer Carter DeHaven purchased Sackheim and Kozoll's script from Warner Bros. for $375,000. DeHaven secured the Cinema Group as a financer and hired John Frankenheimer as director with production to begin in Georgia. This was also the first version of the script in which Rambo survived the film. However, the project stalled again after the distributor Filmways was acquired by Orion Pictures. After Mario Kassar and Andrew G. Vajna of Anabasis Investments read the book, they got interested in doing an adaptation as the first production of their studio Carolco Pictures funded by \"in-house sources\". They purchased the film rights from Warner Bros. for $375,000 and Sackheim and Kozoll's script for $125,000 in 1981. Ted Kotcheff, who had been involved in the project in 1976, returned after Kassar and Vajna offered to finance one of his projects. Kotcheff offered the role of John Rambo to Sylvester Stallone, and the actor accepted after reading the script through in a weekend. Various scripts adapted from Morrell's book had been pitched to studios in the years since its publication, but only Stallone's involvement prompted its production. The time since the end of the Vietnam War and Stallone's star power after the success of the Rocky films enabled him to rewrite the script to make the character of John Rambo more sympathetic. Morrell's book has Rambo kill many of his pursuers, and Kozoll and Sackheim's draft had him killing sixteen people, but in the movie Rambo does not directly cause the death of any police or national guardsmen. Stallone also decided to let Rambo survive the film, unlike in the book. A suicide scene was filmed but Kotcheff and Stallone opted to have Rambo turn himself in at Trautman's urging. Stallone did an estimated seven revisions of the script. Kotcheff requested further work be done on the script, which was performed by Larry Gross and David Giler."

When the project was purchased by Warner Bros., Robert De Niro and Clint Eastwood were both considered for the role of Rambo. Ritt intended to cast Robert Mitchum as Teasle and Paul Newman as Rambo. Pollack considered Steve McQueen but then rejected him because they considered him too old to play a Vietnam veteran from 1975. Rabe developed his screenplay with Al Pacino in mind for the role and had several conversations with the actor, who wanted to portray Rambo as a force of nature after seeing the film Jaws. However, Pacino decided not to be involved because he found the story too dark. When Badham was considered as director he wanted to cast John Travolta as Rambo, George C. Scott as Trautman, and either Gene Hackman or Charles Durning as Teasle. Frankenheimer considered Powers Booth, Michael Douglas, and Nick Nolte as Rambo before casting Brad Davis because of his role in Midnight Express. Dustin Hoffman was offered the role of Rambo but turned it down. For the role of Sheriff Teasle, Kassar and Vajna approached Academy Award winners Hackman and Robert Duvall but both turned the part down. Marvin, another Oscar winner, turned down the part of Colonel Trautman. James Mason and Richard Jaeckel were also considered. Kirk Douglas was eventually hired, but just before shooting began, Douglas quit the role of Colonel Trautman over a script dispute; Douglas wanted to retain the novel's original ending of Rambo and Teasle fatally wounding each other, Trautman finishing Rambo with a kill shot, then sitting with the dying Teasle for the sheriff's final moments. Douglas also wanted Trautman to have more screentime. Rock Hudson was approached as a replacement but was soon to undergo heart surgery and had to pass up the chance to work with Stallone. Richard Crenna was quickly hired as a replacement; the role of Trautman became the veteran character actor's most famous role, a performance for which he received much critical praise."

        "content": "The film was shot in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia, Canada on a $15 million budget beginning on November 15, 1981, and continuing until April 1982. The town scenes in the movie were shot in Hope and the nearby Othello Tunnels, called Chapman Gorge in the film, while the rest of the movie was shot in Capilano Canyon, Golden Ears Provincial Park and Pitt Lake in Pitt Meadows. During the production Buzz Feitshans replaced producer Ed Carlin, who suffered a heart attack. The locations chosen for the film initially experienced unseasonably warm and sunny weather during the filming, which posed challenges since the crew had counted on an overcast setting. However, a period of heavy snowfall beginning in January 1982 delayed the production by two months. Other delays were caused by injuries to the cast during stunts, including Stallone sustaining a serious back injury and several broken ribs, in particular, due to performing his own stunt of dropping off a cliff and into a tree. Since the production ran over schedule, Crenna's role in the film was cut in order to avoid having to pay him higher fees as specified in his contract. The firearms used in the film had to be imported into Canada because of the country's stronger firearms regulation. In January 1982 over $50,000 worth of firearms\u2014including fourteen M16 rifles, three Remington shotguns, two .44 Magnum revolvers, and eleven Colt AR-15 rifles\u2014were stolen from the set. Although the guns had been modified to shoot blanks, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police claimed that they could be easily modified to fire live ammunition. After the incident the set was guarded by the Canadian Army, whose soldiers also served as extras in the film."

The ending used in the finished film was shot in March 1982, after the original one was deemed unsatisfactory. Kassar and Vajna sought either Warner Bros. 20th Century Fox, or Paramount Pictures as a distributor, displaying an 18-minute promotional reel to studios. Although they secured international distributors, they were unable to locate a domestic distributor to the film until they sent a longer 55-minute reel to the American Film Market.

He commented, \"although almost all of First Blood is implausible, because it's Stallone on the screen, we'll buy it\", and rated the film three out of four stars. The New York Times film critic Janet Maslin described Rambo as a \"fierce, agile, hollow-eyed hero\", who is portrayed as a \"tormented, misunderstood, amazingly resourceful victim of the Vietnam War, rather than as a sadist or a villain\". Maslin also praised the film's story for its \"energy and ingenuity\". Conversely, Variety called the film \"a mess\" and criticized its ending for not providing a proper resolution for the main character.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://variety.com/1981/film/reviews/first-blood-1200425212/ |title=Review: First Blood |magazine=Variety |date=December 31, 1981 |access-date=June 25, 2013 |archive-date=October 4, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004230556/http://variety.com/1981/film/reviews/first-blood-1200425212/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2000, BBC film critic Almar Haflidason noted that Stallone's training in survival skills and hand-to-hand combat gave the film \"a raw and authentic edge that excited the audiences of the time\". Film.com and Filmsite regard First Blood as one of the best films of 1982, and in 2008 it was named the 253rd greatest film ever by Empire magazine on its 2008 list of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 85% approval rating based on 46 reviews, with an average rating of 7.20/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"Much darker and more sensitive than the sequels it spawned, First Blood is a thrilling survival adventure that takes full advantage of Sylvester Stallone's acting skills.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". James Berardinelli of ReelViews called the film \"a tense and effective piece of filmmaking\". He noted that the film's darker tone, somber subtext, and non-exploitative violence allowed the viewer to enjoy the film not only as an action/thriller but as something with a degree of intelligence and substance. On Stallone's performance, he wrote \"it seems impossible to imagine anyone other than Stallone in the part, and his capabilities as an actor should not be dismissed\". In the 2010 edition of his Movie Guide Leonard Maltin gave the film one-and a half stars out of four, saying that it \"throws all credibility to the winds about the time [Rambo] gets off with only a bad cut after jumping from a mountain into some jagged rocks\". Legacy First Blood has received the most positive reception of the Rambo franchise, and the next four sequels received mixed or average reviews. In a 2011 article for Blade Magazine, by Mike Carter, credit is given to Morrell and the Rambo franchise for revitalizing the cutlery industry in the 1980s; due to the presence of the Jimmy Lile and Gil Hibben knives used in the films.

Jia-Chien's apartment investment falls through as she discovers that the apartment company went bankrupt and ran away with her savings. She also learns that it was Li Kai who broke Jia-Jen's heart in college and avoids romance with him. Jia-Ning faces a dilemma when she begins dating Guo-Lun even after Rachel confesses that she loves him. Mr. Zhu's health deteriorates and secretly visits the hospital, unaware that Jia-Chien saw him while visiting Old Wen. Eventually, Old Wen passes away and Mr. Zhu concludes that his sense of taste has officially departed. At another Sunday feast, Jia-Chien announces that she will no longer be moving out; Mr. Zhu tells her not to worry. Later, Jia-Ning reveals her relationship with Guo-Lun and her pregnancy. The next dinner, Jia-Jen divulges that she and Ming-Dao have eloped. Jia-Jen and Jia-Ning move out of the residence, leaving Mr. Zhu with Jia-Chien. Troubled, Mr. Zhu begins to confide in and meet Madame Liang, leading the daughters to believe that the two are romantically involved. Worried about her father's health, Jia-Chien rejects her promotion. Soon, the sisters, their partners, and Jin-Rong's family gather for a large Sunday feast. Mr. Zhu announces his engagement, not to Madame Liang, but to Jin-Rong, abruptly ending the dinner. Later, Jia-Ning and Guo-Lun have their baby, Jia-Jen converts Ming-Dao to Christianity, and Mr. Zhu sells the family home and buys a condo with Jin-Rong and Shan-Shan. Jia-Chien, no longer needing to take care of her father, accepts the job in Amsterdam. Before she leaves she prepares a final feast for the family in the family home, but only Mr. Zhu arrives. When Mr. Zhu criticizes her cooking, he suddenly realizes that his sense of taste has returned. The two hold each other\u2019s hands in the dining room, and call each other \u201cFather\u201d and \u201cDaughter\u201d."

They wrote that her Christianity was there \"perhaps to match her role as a mother-figure\". She suspects Jia-Chien of disapproving of her moral system. Dariotis and Fung wrote that after Jia-Chien states that she needs not a mother but sister, Jia-Jen \"is able to become who she really is with all the complexity that entails\" rather than being someone she believed her family needed, with \"who she really is\" being \"a modern, conservative, Christian, sexually aggressive Taiwanese woman\". Desson Howe of the Washington Post wrote that of the actresses, Yang was the \"most memorable\". Dariotis and Fung wrote that Jia-Ning's story is of \"na\u00efvet\u00e9 and immature love\" and that the love triangle involving her, Guo Lun, and Rachel \"is in many ways a parody of comic book romance.\" Dariotis and Fung argue that Jia-Ning's story, along with Jia-Jen's, is \"not only flat but also dangerously uncomplicated.\" They further state that \"[t]he lack of inquiry is endemic of this storyline\" and that its \"superficial treatment\" is \"quite disturbing.\" \u201cDue to love and traditional matters, they have to obey, they have to care well. They\u2019re not really level with each other. I think that\u2019s the biggest problem in that family, so the food and that banquet in the movie has become a ritual,\u201d said Ang Lee. The banquet becomes a burden on the family. The authors Hong Zhao and Haixin Jin argue in their article \u7834\u574f\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u4f20\u627f\u2014\u2014\u300a\u996e\u98df\u7537\u5973\u300b\u89e3\u8bfb that in the film Eat Drink Man Woman, Zhu\u2019s family first maintains a semblance of calm when everyone represses their desires, then, the family is destructed when members throw off the shackles of their family roles to pursue their own desires. The family structure is eventually reconstructed when everyone\u2019s desire for eat, drink and sex is well balanced. At the beginning of the film, Zhu\u2019s\u00a0family struggles between maintaining the banquet (eat and drink) and their sexual desire (man and woman). Food is the bond that holds the family together. However, though they dine together every week, they are afraid to confide in each other. When they focus on \u201ceat drink\u201d but suppress sexual desire, the family is unhappy. No one enjoys the meal and Zhu even loses his sense of taste. When Zhu, Jia Jen, and Jia Ning chase after their sexual desires (man and woman), the original family structure disintegrates, but the family becomes happier since everyone gets what they want. The desire for food and sex eventually reach a balance and Zhu\u2019s sense of taste is back at this moment. Each character in this film has their own desire but at the beginning of the film, due to the concern with their family roles, they cannot express themselves."

Si-hung Lung takes the place of a father in all three films - here as Mr. Zhu, a retired master chef - and He had used it as the motif (idealization of the household's head) to resolve all the contradictions and conflict that happened within the family members.

The film was directed, co-written, and produced by series creator Stephen Hillenburg, with live-action sequences directed by Mark Osborne. It features the series' regular voice cast with Alec Baldwin, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeffrey Tambor voicing new characters and David Hasselhoff appearing as himself. It is the first film in the SpongeBob SquarePants film series. In this film, Plankton enacts a plan to discredit his business nemesis Mr. Krabs, steal the Krabby Patty secret formula and take over the world by stealing King Neptune's crown and framing Mr. Krabs for the crime. SpongeBob and Patrick team up to retrieve the crown from Shell City to save Mr. Krabs from Neptune's wrath and their world from Plankton's rule. Hillenburg accepted an offer for a film adaptation of SpongeBob SquarePants from Paramount Pictures in 2002, after having turned it down multiple times the previous year. He assembled a team from the show's writing staff, including himself, Derek Drymon, Tim Hill, Kent Osborne, Aaron Springer, and Paul Tibbitt, and they structured the film as a mythical hero's journey that would bring SpongeBob and Patrick to the surface. The film was originally intended to serve as the series finale, but Nickelodeon ordered more episodes of the series as it had become increasingly profitable, so Hillenburg resigned as showrunner, with Tibbitt taking his place. The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie premiered in Los Angeles on November 14, 2004, and was released in the United States on November 19. It grossed $141 million worldwide, becoming the sixth highest-grossing animated film of 2004. Two standalone sequels have been released: The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water (2015) and The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run (2020)."

        "content": "The movie begins with a live-action sequence of a pirate crew finding tickets to The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie and sailing to the movie theater to watch the film. In the movie proper, SpongeBob prepares for the opening ceremony of the Krusty Krab 2 (located next to the original Krusty Krab), believing that his boss Mr. Krabs will promote him as manager of the new restaurant. At the ceremony, the title is instead given to his co-worker Squidward Tentacles. Krabs says that Squidward is more mature and that SpongeBob is \"just a kid\" who is unable to handle the task, upsetting SpongeBob. Meanwhile, Plankton laments over his futile attempts to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula and take over the world, until his computer wife Karen reminds him of \"Plan Z\". At night, Plankton carries out the plan by stealing King Neptune's crown and sending it to Shell City, leaving false evidence behind to frame Krabs for the crime. That same night, SpongeBob heads to his favorite restaurant, Goofy Goober's, where he drowns his sorrows in ice cream with his best friend Patrick Star, and wakes up the next morning with a hangover. King Neptune goes to the Krusty Krab 2 to confront Krabs about his stolen crown. The still-hungover SpongeBob also arrives and bad-mouths Krabs, but upon seeing that his boss's life is at risk, promises Neptune that he will retrieve the crown from Shell City. Neptune is convinced by his daughter Mindy to give SpongeBob a chance; he freezes Krabs and orders SpongeBob to return with the crown within six days in order to spare Krabs's life. Mindy warns SpongeBob and Patrick of the dangers of Shell City, including \"the Cyclops\", who captures innocent sea creatures who are never to be seen again. SpongeBob and Patrick head off for Shell City in the Patty Wagon - a Krabby Patty-shaped car stored underneath the Krusty Krab. Back in Bikini Bottom, Plankton steals the Krabby Patty formula and uses it to sell Krabby Patties at his restaurant, the Chum Bucket, claiming Krabs willed the recipe to him. When Karen informs him that SpongeBob and Patrick are attempting to reclaim Neptune's crown, Plankton reveals he has hired a hitman named Dennis to eliminate the duo. Squidward discovers the truth about Plankton stealing Neptune's crown and goes to the Chum Bucket to confront him. Before Squidward can leave and alert Neptune, Plankton activates his mind-controlling souvenir bucket helmets to enslave the residents of Bikini Bottom, seizing Squidward as well. Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Patrick come across a hazardous trench and lose the Patty Wagon. About to give up, Mindy appears and gives them encouragement by using her \"mermaid magic\" to bestow seaweed mustaches on them, convincing them that they have matured from boys into men and they successfully pass the trench. SpongeBob and Patrick meet Dennis who tries to step on them with his giant boot, but he gets stomped on by a larger boot - which belongs to the previously mentioned Cyclops (a diver). The Cyclops captures SpongeBob and Patrick and takes them to his store by the beach where dead, dried sea creatures are sold as souvenirs, which is in fact \"Shell City\" itself. SpongeBob and Patrick find the crown, but the Cyclops' heat lamp dries them. However, they shed tears just before their temporary demise that short-circuits the lamp, which releases smoke and activates the emergency sprinkler system, reviving them, as well as the other dried-out sea creatures being sold as souvenirs. While the vengeful sea creatures attack the Cyclops, SpongeBob and Patrick take the crown and head out to the beach. After accidentally losing their way home, David Hasselhoff appears and offers them a ride. On the way, Dennis catches up to them, but gets knocked off Hasselhoff's back into the sea when he passes underneath a catamaran. Back at the Krusty Krab 2, Neptune arrives to execute Krabs when SpongeBob and Patrick return with the crown with Hasselhoff's help and save Krabs. However, Plankton drops a mind-control bucket on Neptune and surrounds SpongeBob, Patrick and Mindy with his army of slaves. SpongeBob, embracing the fact that he's accomplished so much despite being a kid, uses the power of rock and roll to play \"Goofy Goober Rock\" (a parody of Twisted Sister's \"I Wanna Rock\"), and frees Neptune and the citizens of Bikini Bottom from the helmets with his magic guitar. Plankton tries to escape, but is squashed flat when a horde of citizens arrive at the Krusty Krab 2 and rush in to greet the one who liberated them. Plankton is then arrested by the police and King Neptune thanks SpongeBob for his bravery and unfreezes Krabs (only to accidentally turn him into a real human boy before actually reverting him to his normal self), who graciously gives the title of general manager of the Krusty Krab 2 to him."

        "content": "The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie was long-planned; Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures had approached series creator Stephen Hillenburg for a film based on the show, but he refused for more than a year. Hillenburg was concerned, after watching The Iron Giant (1999) and Toy Story (1995) with his son, about the challenge of SpongeBob and Patrick doing something more cinematically-consequential and inspiring without losing what he called the SpongeBob \"cadence\". While on a break from season four post-production, \"To do a 75-minute movie about SpongeBob wanting to make some jellyfish jelly would be a mistake, I think\u00a0this had to be SpongeBob in a great adventure. That's where the comedy's coming from, having these two na\u00efve characters, SpongeBob and Patrick, a doofus and an idiot, on this incredibly dangerous heroic odyssey with all the odds against them.\" In 2002, Hillenburg and the show's staff stopped making episodes to work on the film after the show's third season. The film's plot originally had SpongeBob rescue Patrick from a fisherman in Florida; an obvious reference to the 2003 film, Finding Nemo (2003), this was later said by Tom Kenny (the voice of SpongeBob) to be a \"joke\" plot to keep fans busy. Hillenburg directed the film and wrote it with five other writer-animators from the show (Paul Tibbitt, Derek Drymon, Aaron Springer, Kent Osborne, and Tim Hill) over a three-month period in a room of a former Glendale, California bank. Osborne said, \"It was hugely fun\u00a0although it did get kind of gamy in there.\" At the beginning of the series, Hillenburg screened a number of silent shorts (from Laurel and Hardy, Charlie Chaplin, and Buster Keaton) and work by two modern comic actors: Jerry Lewis and Pee-wee Herman, both obvious inspirations for SpongeBob. For the film, the writers created a mythical hero's quest: the search for a stolen crown, which brings SpongeBob and Patrick to the surface. Bill Fagerbakke (the voice of Patrick) said about the plot, \"It's just nuts. I'm continually dazzled and delighted with what these guys came up with.\" When the film was completed, Hillenburg wanted to end the series \"so it wouldn't jump the shark\". However, Nickelodeon desired more episodes; Hillenburg stated: \"Well, there was concern when we did the movie [in 2004] that the show had peaked. There were concerns among executives at Nickelodeon.\" As a result, Hillenburg resigned as the series' showrunner, appointing writer, director, and storyboard artist Paul Tibbitt to succeed him. Tibbitt was one of Hillenburg's favorite crew members: \"[I] totally trusted him.\" Tibbitt would remain showrunner until he was succeeded in 2015 by the show's creative director Vincent Waller and staff writer Marc Ceccarelli. He also acted as an executive producer from 2008 to 2018. Hillenburg no longer wrote or ran the show on a day-to-day basis, but reviewed each episode and submitted suggestions: \"I figure when I'm pretty old I can still paint\u00a0I don't know about running shows.\" Kenny, Fagerbakke, and the crew confirmed that they had completed four episodes for broadcast on Nickelodeon in early 2005, and planned to finish a total of about 20 for the fourth season. In 2015, Hillenburg returned to the show following the completion of the second film as an executive producer, having greater creative input and attending crew meetings until his death on November 26, 2018. In September 2003, Jules Engel, Hillenburg's mentor when he studied experimental animation at the California Institute of the Arts, died. Hillenburg dedicated the film to him: \"He truly was the most influential artistic person in my life. I consider him my 'Art Dad.'\""

Johansson accepted the role because she liked cartoons and was a fan of The Ren & Stimpy Show. When Jeffrey Tambor signed for his voice cameo, he saw his character (King Neptune) and joked, \"This is me.\" He remembered the first cartoon he saw, Bambi (1942): \"My first cartoon, I had to be carried out crying\u00a0It was Bambi. It's like the great American wound: the death of Bambi's mother. 'Run, Bambi, run!'\" Another guest voice was Alec Baldwin; Stephen Hillenburg said that the actor recorded his character Dennis on a \"phone\": \"I wouldn't say that about his performance. He might be mad if we said that. Technically, it was like he was in another booth in the studio.\" David Hasselhoff accepted the role when his daughters, Taylor-Ann and Hayley, urged him: \"I got an offer to do a cameo in the SpongeBob Movie and I turned to my girls, who were like 16 and 14, and I said, 'Who's SpongeBob?' and they said, 'Oh my God, Dad, it's the number one cartoon in the world, you gotta do it.'\" Hasselhoff enjoyed his cameo: \"It was great fun and to this day around the world kids stop me and say, 'Are you David Hasselhoff?' because I was the only human in the picture.\" Hasselhoff said that the film gained him new fans: \"It's amazing - so many of the kids were so young and didn't see Baywatch and Knight Rider so I got a whole new legion of fans.\""

        "content": "There were a number of stages involved in the making of the film, beginning with a rough animation process of ideas drawn on Post-it notes. The writers drew, working from rough outlines rather than scripts (which made the humor more visual than verbal). The storyboard artists, including Sherm Cohen, then illustrated ideas conceived by the writers. In the series Tom Yasumi and Andrew Overtoom do the animatics, but Hillenburg and Drymon did the animatics for the film. Yasumi and Overtoom were the film's animation-timing directors, concentrating on the sheets. The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, like the series, was animated at Rough Draft Studios in South Korea. The animators worked semi-digitally with pencil-drawn poses that would be composited into layouts in Photoshop. Series writer and storyboard artist Erik Wiese left the show for a year to work on Samurai Jack and Danny Phantom, but returned to do storyboards and character layout for the film. He \"always wanted to be a feature animator, and the movie felt like I was on the character animation end\", describing the experience as \"a blast it felt like coming home.\" Hillenburg enjoyed the process of making the film: \"The TV schedule is tight, and you don't always have a lot of time to work on your drawings.\" He appreciated the film's hand-drawn animation: \"I think the movie's drawings are much superior than the TV show\", although CGI animation was flourishing at the time of the film's release. \"There's a lot of talk about 2-D being dead, and I hope people don't think that. Even Brad Bird is a proponent of 2-D. He would agree with me that it's all about what you're trying to say. There are many ways to tell a story, and what's unique about animation is that there are many styles with which to tell a story.\" The clay animation scenes were shot by Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh and Chris Finnegan at Screen Novelties in Los Angeles."

The ship used during the 30-second opening featuring the pirates singing the theme song was the Bounty, a -long, enlarged reconstruction of the 1787 Royal Navy sailing ship HMS Bounty built for Mutiny on the Bounty (1962). The ship appeared in a number of other films, including Treasure Island (1999), Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006), and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007). In film trailers, live-action scenes were taken from Das Boot (1981), The Hunt for Red October (1990), and U-571 (2000). David Hasselhoff made a cameo in the live-action scenes, offering SpongeBob and Patrick a ride to Bikini Bottom. The scene was originally written before consulting Hasselhoff. Hillenburg was pleased with the storyboards; Lead storyboard artist Sherm Cohen said, \"He had been wrestling with the ending for quite a while, and finally he was ready to pitch his ideas to some of the other board artists.\" Hillenburg was counting on casting Hasselhoff, and the first question he asked him was \"So, do we have Hasselhoff?\" He replied \"No\", with a grin. Hasselhoff eventually agreed, before seeing the script. Hillenburg said about the actor, \"He's a great guy. ...\u00a0He was great at making fun of himself.\" The crew built a ,  replica of Hasselhoff. The $100,000 replica was kept at Hasselhoff's home; he has said, \"It freaked me out because it was so lifelike, with teeth, when you touch it it feels like real skin. It's soft, like your skin.\" At the completion of filming, Hasselhoff said, \"That's ridiculously awesome. What are you gonna do with it?\" Asked by the crew if he wanted to keep it, he answered, \"Uh, yeah. Okay.\" Hasselhoff filmed in cold water, where he was pulled by a sled nine yards across the sea; he described the experience as \"cold but a lot of fun.\" In late March 2014, Hasselhoff offered the replica up for auction with other memorabilia collected during his career. Julien's Auctions handled the item's sale, which were expected to bring in between $20,000 and $30,000. Ultimately, Hasselhoff pulled the item, just a few days before the auction."

She informs SpongeBob and Patrick that they can return to Bikini Bottom by taking a bus at the beach. This idea was later used for the second film The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water (2015), where Sandy became a giant realistic squirrel.

Narholz was honored at the 2005 ASCAP Film and Television Music Awards for his work on the film, and received a nomination for Music in an Animated Feature Production at the 32nd Annie Awards. American rock band The Flaming Lips recorded SpongeBob And Patrick Confront the Psychic Wall of Energy They shot the song's music video, directed by band member Wayne Coyne and filmmaker Bradley Beesley, in Austin, Texas. Coyne said, \"Stephen Hillenburg seems to be a fan of the weirder music of the late '80s and early '90s.\u00a0He wanted to evoke the music he got turned onto back then.\" Coyne suggested a duet with Justin Timberlake, but Hillenburg refused, saying \"I don't want any of those sort of commercial weirdos on there. I don't like those commercial people. I like you guys, and Wilco and Ween.\" American band Wilco wrote and recorded \"Just a Kid\". One of the film's producers contacted frontman Jeff Tweedy after seeing a SpongeBob air freshener hanging from Tweedy's rearview mirror in I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco (2002). Tweedy said, \"I fell in love with SpongeBob when I heard him describe the darkness at the bottom of the sea as 'advanced darkness'.\u00a0How could I not write a song for this film?

Kenny and Paley were working on what would become the album The Best Day Ever, writing \"The Best Day Ever\" and \"Under My Rock\". The film's production team needed two more tracks for the soundtrack; Hillenburg heard the songs, and decided to include them. \"The Best Day Ever\" ended up being played during the film's closing credits."

Hillenburg had no problem with candy and ice cream tie-ins, Pistor said (because of the treats' simplicity), but he had issues with fast food tie-ins; according to him, the latter was \"full of hidden additives.\" Pistor said, \"The trouble is that you can't go out with animated films without a fast-food tie-in. People don't take you seriously.\" Hillenburg replied, \"Yeah, well, my take on that is that we shouldn't do that. We didn't want to suddenly become the people serving up food that's not that good for you especially kids. We work with Burger King, and they make toys and watches. But to actually take the step of pushing the food, that's crossing the line. I don't want to be the Pied Piper of fast food.\" Variety estimated the media value was $150 million. The film was promoted across the United States. Nickelodeon joined Burger King for a 12-figure toy line based on the film, and about 4,700 Burger King stores perched , inflatable SpongeBob figures on their roofs as part of the promotion (one of the largest in fast food history). Customers could also purchase one of five different SpongeBob-themed watches for $1.99 with the purchase of a value meal. On November 11, 2004, it was reported that a number of the inflatables had been stolen from Burger King roofs nationwide. Burger King chief marketing officer Russ Klein said, \"As to the motives behind these apparent 'spongenappings', we can only speculate. We did receive one ransom note related to an inflatable SpongeBob disappearance in Minnesota.\" The chain offered a year's supply of Whopper sandwiches as a reward for information leading to the return of inflatables stolen in November. One was found attached to a railing at the football-field 50-yard line at an Iowa college, and another under a bed in Virginia. A ransom note was found for a third: \"We have SpongeBob. Give us 10 Krabby Patties, fries, and milkshakes.\" Steven Simon and Conrad (C.J.) Mercure Jr. were arrested after stealing an inflatable from a Burger King in St. Mary's County, Maryland. While facing up to 18 months in jail and a $500 fine, Simon and Mercure said they were proud of what they did; Simon said, \"Once we got caught by the police, we were like, now we can tell everybody.\" The following year, Burger King took \"extra security precautions\" in response to the SpongeBob incident, when Stormtroopers from George Lucas' Star Wars guarded the delivery of Star Wars toys to a Burger King in North Hollywood as part of a promotion for Revenge of the Sith (2005). The Cayman Islands joined with Nickelodeon to create the first Cayman Islands Sea School with SpongeBob for the film. The partnership was announced by Pilar Bush, Deputy Director of Tourism for Cayman Islands, on March 10, 2004. As part of the agreement the Cayman partnership was seen on Nickelodeon's global multimedia platforms, including on-air, online, and in magazines. Other promotional partners included Mitsubishi, Holiday Inn, Kellogg's, and Perfetti Van Melle. In 2005, Nickelodeon and Simon Spotlight released a book, Ice-Cream Dreams, as a tie-in to the film. It was written by Nancy E. Krulik and illustrated by Heather Martinez, with Krulik and Derek Drymon as contributors."

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four, calling it \"the 'Good Burger' of animation\u00a0plopping us down inside a fast-food war being fought by sponges, starfish, crabs, tiny plankton and mighty King Neptune.\" Ed Park of The Village Voice wrote, \"No Pixar? No problem! An unstoppable good-mood generator, the resolutely 2-D [The] SpongeBob SquarePants Movie has more yuks than Shark Tale (2004) and enough soul to swallow The Polar Express whole.\" Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, calling it \"an animated adventure that's funnier than Shark Tale and more charming than The Polar Express.\" Randy Cordova of The Arizona Republic said, \"Like the TV show it's based on, it's a daffy, enjoyable creation.\" Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News gave the feature a score of three out of four: \"It's not The Incredibles, or one of those animated features that spent zillions on character design, pedigree and verisimilitude. But SpongeBob is a sweet, silly thing with a child-friendly esthetic all its own.\" Will Lawrence of Empire gave the film four out of five stars, calling it \"a film for kids, students, stoners, anyone who enjoys a break from reality.\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave it a B-minus grade: \"The best moments in his [SpongeBob SquarePants] first movie outing are those that feel most TV-like, just another day in the eternally optimistic undersea society created with such contagious silliness by Stephen Hillenburg.\" Desson Thomson of The Washington Post enjoyed the film: \"You gotta love SpongeBob. Coolest sponge in the sea, although this one has a suspiciously manufactured look.\" Carla Meyer of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that \"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie retains the 2-D charm of the hugely popular Nickelodeon cartoon but adds a few tricks a little 3-D here, a little David Hasselhoff there. The series' appeal never lay in its visuals, however. 'SpongeBob' endeared itself to kids and adults through sweetness and cleverness, also abundant here.\" A. O. Scott of The New York Times gave it a score of four out of five: \"If you're tired of\u00a0bluster and swagger, SpongeBob is your man.\" Tom Maurstad of The Dallas Morning News also gave the film a B-minus grade: \"Being so good is what led to making the movie, and it's also the reason that many small-screen episodes are better than this big-screen venture.\" Some reviews praised David Hasselhoff's appearance in the film. Jennifer Frey of The Washington Post wrote, \"Getting to see the hairs on Hasselhoff's back (and thighs, and calves) magnified exponentially is perhaps a bit creepy. Like the movie, it's all in good fun.\" Cinema Blend founder Joshua Tyler called Hasselhoff's role \"the best movie cameo I've seen since Fred Savage stuck a joint in his crotch and played a clarinet to charm the resulting smoke like a snake.\" David Edelstein of Slate criticized the film's plot, calling it a \"big, heavy anchor of a story structure to weigh him down.\" Mike Clark of USA Today called it \"harmlessly off-the-cuff but facing far more pedigreed multiplex competition\u00a0SpongeBob barely rates as OK when compared with The Incredibles.\" A reviewer noted in Time Out London, \"Anyone expecting anything more risky will be sadly disappointed.\" In his Variety review, Todd McCarthy said the film \"takes on rather too much water during its extended feature-length submersion.\" While the film received mostly positive reviews by critics and by fans of the show, it is considered a turning point in the show's history; many fans believe that the television series has declined in quality since the film's release. While episodes aired before the film were praised for their \"uncanny brilliance\", those aired after the film have been called \"kid-pandering attention-waster[s]\", \"tedious\", \"boring\", \"dreck\", a \"depressing plateau of mediocrity\" and \"laugh-skimpy.\" After the film's release, fans \"began to turn away from the show,\" causing fansites to \"bec[ome] deserted.\" Some fans believe that the show's 2012 ratings decline correlates with a decline in quality, and \"whatever fan support [the show] enjoys is not enough\" to save it from its slide in ratings. This was due to the fact that Stephen Hillenburg and many writers left the show."

It is based on the 1996 novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. Norton plays the unnamed narrator, who is discontented with his white-collar job. He forms a \"fight club\" with soap salesman Tyler Durden (Pitt), and becomes embroiled in a relationship with a destitute woman, Marla Singer (Bonham Carter). Palahniuk's novel was optioned by Fox 2000 Pictures producer Laura Ziskin, who hired Jim Uhls to write the film adaptation. Fincher was selected because of his enthusiasm for the story. He developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice from the cast and others in the film industry. It was filmed in and around Los Angeles from July to December 1998. He and the cast compared the film to Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and The Graduate (1967), with a theme of conflict between Generation X and the value system of advertising. Studio executives did not like the film, and they restructured Fincher's intended marketing campaign to try to reduce anticipated losses. Fight Club failed to meet the studio's expectations at the box office, and received polarized reactions from critics. It was ranked as one of the most controversial and talked-about films of 1999. The film later found commercial success with its home video release, establishing Fight Club as a cult classic and causing media to revisit the film. In 2009, on the tenth anniversary of the film's release, The New York Times dubbed it the \"defining cult movie of our time.\""

        "content": "The Narrator, an automobile recall specialist, is unfulfilled by his job and possessions and suffers from chronic insomnia. To cure this, he attends support groups, posing as a sufferer of diseases. His bliss is disturbed when another impostor, Marla Singer, begins attending the same groups. The two agree to split which groups they attend. On a flight home from a business trip, the Narrator meets soap salesman Tyler Durden. The Narrator returns home to find his apartment and all his belongings have been destroyed by an explosion. Disheartened by the loss of his material goods, he calls Tyler and they meet at a bar. Tyler tells him he is trapped by consumerism. In the parking lot, he asks the Narrator to hit him, and they have a fistfight. They find the experience cathartic, and agree to do it again. The Narrator moves into Tyler's home, a large dilapidated house in an industrial area. They have further fights outside the bar, which attract growing crowds of men. The fights move to the bar's basement where the men form the eponymous Fight Club, which routinely meets. Marla overdoses on pills and telephones the Narrator for help; he ignores her, but Tyler goes to her apartment to save her. They begin a sexual relationship, much to the Narrator's irritation. Tyler warns the Narrator never to talk to Marla about him. The Narrator blackmails his boss for his company's assets to support Fight Club and quits his job. More new members join Fight Club, including Robert \"Bob\" Paulson, a man with testicular cancer whom the Narrator had previously met at one of his support groups. Tyler then recruits their members to a new anti-materialist and anti-corporate organization, Project Mayhem, without the Narrator's involvement. The group engages in subversive acts of vandalism, increasingly troubling the Narrator. After the Narrator complains that Tyler has excluded him, Tyler reveals that he was the one who caused the explosion at the Narrator's condo. Tyler disappears one night, and when Paulson is killed by the police fleeing from a sabotage operation, the Narrator tries to halt the project. He follows a paper trail to cities Tyler had visited, discovering Project Mayhem has spread throughout the country. In one city, a project member addresses the Narrator as \"Mr. Durden.\" Confused, the Narrator calls Marla and discovers that she also believes he is Tyler. Tyler appears in his hotel room with a different haircut and clothing, and reveals that they are dissociated personalities; the Narrator assumed the personality of Tyler when he believed he was sleeping. The Narrator blacks out. When he returns to the house, he uncovers Tyler's plans to erase debt by destroying buildings that contain credit card records. He apologizes to Marla and warns her that she is in danger, but she is tired of his contradictory behavior and refuses to listen. He tries to warn the police, but the officers are members of the Project. He attempts to disarm the explosives in one building, but Tyler subdues him. With Tyler holding him at gunpoint on the top floor, the Narrator realizes that, as he and Tyler are the same person, the Narrator is holding the gun. He fires it into his own mouth, shooting through his cheek. Tyler dies, and the Narrator ceases mentally projecting him. Project Mayhem members bring a kidnapped Marla to the building. Holding hands, the Narrator and Marla watch as the explosives detonate, collapsing buildings around them."

        "content": "Fincher said Fight Club was a coming of age film, like the 1967 film The Graduate but for people in their 30s. Fincher described the narrator as an \"everyman\"; the character is identified in the script as \"Jack\", but left unnamed in the film. Fincher outlined the Narrator's background: \"He's tried to do everything he was taught to do, tried to fit into the world by becoming the thing he isn't.\" He cannot find happiness, so he travels on a path to enlightenment in which he must \"kill\" his parents, god, and teacher. By the start of the film, he has \"killed off\" his parents. With Tyler Durden, he kills his god by doing things they are not supposed to do. To complete the process of maturing, the Narrator has to kill his teacher, Tyler Durden. The character is a 1990s inverse of the Graduate archetype: \"a guy who does not have a world of possibilities in front of him, he has no possibilities, he literally cannot imagine a way to change his life.\" He is confused and angry, so he responds to his environment by creating Tyler Durden, a Nietzschean \u00dcbermensch, in his mind. While Tyler is who the Narrator wants to be, he is not empathetic and does not help the Narrator face decisions in his life \"that are complicated and have moral and ethical implications\". Fincher explained: \"[Tyler] can deal with the concepts of our lives in an idealistic fashion, but it doesn't have anything to do with the compromises of real life as modern man knows it. Which is: you're not really necessary to a lot of what's going on. It's built, it just needs to run now.\" While studio executives worried that Fight Club was going to be \"sinister and seditious\", Fincher sought to make it \"funny and seditious\" by including humor to temper the sinister element. Screenwriter Jim Uhls described the film as a romantic comedy, explaining: \"It has to do with the characters' attitudes toward a healthy relationship, which is a lot of behavior which seems unhealthy and harsh to each other, but in fact does work for them\u2014because both characters are out on the edge psychologically.\" The Narrator seeks intimacy, but avoids it with Marla Singer, seeing too much of himself in her. While Marla is a seductive and negativist prospect for the Narrator, he embraces the novelty and excitement that comes with befriending Tyler. The Narrator is comfortable being personally connected to Tyler, but becomes jealous when Tyler becomes sexually involved with Marla. When the Narrator argues with Tyler about their friendship, Tyler tells him that being friends is secondary to pursuing the philosophy they have been exploring. When Tyler implies that Marla is a risk they should remove, the Narrator realizes he should have focused on her and begins to diverge from Tyler's path. The Narrator, an unreliable narrator, is not immediately aware that he is mentally projecting Tyler. He also mistakenly promotes the fight clubs as a way to feel powerful, though the Narrator's physical condition worsens while Tyler Durden's appearance improves. While Tyler desires \"real experiences\" of actual fights like the Narrator at first, he manifests a nihilistic attitude of rejecting and destroying institutions and value systems. His impulsive nature, representing the id, is seductive and liberating to the Narrator and the members of Project Mayhem. Tyler's initiatives and methods become dehumanizing; he orders around the members of Project Mayhem with a megaphone similar to camp directors at Chinese re-education camps. The Narrator pulls back from Tyler and arrives at a middle ground between his conflicting selves. Fight Club examines Generation X angst as '\"the middle children of history\". Norton said it examines the value conflicts of Generation X as the first generation raised on television: this generation had \"its value system largely dictated to it by advertising culture\", and was told one could achieve \"spiritual happiness through home furnishing\". His character walks through his apartment while visual effects identify his many IKEA possessions. Fincher described the Narrator's immersion: \"It was just the idea of living in this fraudulent idea of happiness.\" Pitt said, \"Fight Club is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it, so for the first time we can experience the pain.\" Fight Club also parallels the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause; both probe the frustrations of the people in the system.  The characters, having undergone societal emasculation, are reduced to \"a generation of spectators\". A culture of advertising defines society's \"external signifiers of happiness\", causing an unnecessary chase for material goods that replaces the more essential pursuit of spiritual happiness. The film references consumer products such as Gucci, Calvin Klein, and the Volkswagen New Beetle. Norton said of the Beetle, \"We smash it\u00a0... because it seemed like the classic example of a Baby Boomer generation marketing plan that sold culture back to us.\" Pitt explained the dissonance: \"I think there's a self-defense mechanism that keeps my generation from having any real honest connection or commitment with our true feelings. We're rooting for ball teams, but we're not getting in there to play. We're so concerned with failure and success\u2014like these two things are all that's going to sum you up at the end.\" The violence of the fight clubs serves not to promote or glorify combat, but for participants to experience feeling in a society where they are otherwise numb. The fights represent a resistance to the impulse to be \"cocooned\" in society. Norton believed the fighting strips away the \"fear of pain\" and \"the reliance on material signifiers of their self-worth\", leaving them to experience something valuable. When the fights evolve into revolutionary violence, the film only half-accepts the revolutionary dialectic by Tyler Durden; the Narrator pulls back and rejects Durden's ideas. Fight Club purposely shapes an ambiguous message whose interpretation is left to the audience. Fincher said: \"I love this idea that you can have fascism without offering any direction or solution. Isn't the point of fascism to say, 'This is the way we should be going'? But this movie couldn't be further from offering any kind of solution.\""

        "content": "The novel Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk was published in 1996. Before its publication, a Fox Searchlight Pictures book scout sent a galley proof of the novel to creative executive Kevin McCormick. The executive assigned a studio reader to review the proof as a candidate for a film adaptation, but the reader discouraged it. McCormick then forwarded the proof to producers Lawrence Bender and Art Linson, who also rejected it. Producers Josh Donen and Ross Bell saw potential and expressed interest. They arranged unpaid screen readings with actors to determine the script's length, and an initial reading lasted six hours. The producers cut out sections to reduce the running time, and they used the shorter script to record its dialogue. Bell sent the recording to Laura Ziskin, head of the division Fox 2000, who listened to the tape and purchased the rights to Fight Club from Palahniuk for $10,000. Ziskin initially considered hiring Buck Henry to write the adaptation, finding Fight Club similar to the 1967 film The Graduate, which Henry had adapted. When a new screenwriter, Jim Uhls, lobbied Donen and Bell for the job, the producers chose him over Henry. Bell contacted four directors to direct the film. He considered Peter Jackson the best choice, but Jackson was too busy filming the 1996 film The Frighteners in New Zealand. Bryan Singer received the book but did not read it. Danny Boyle met with Bell and read the book, but he pursued another film. David Fincher, who had read Fight Club and had tried to buy the rights himself, talked with Ziskin about directing the film. He hesitated to accept the assignment with 20th Century Fox at first because he had an unpleasant experience directing the 1992 film Alien 3 for the studio. To repair his relationship with the studio, he met with Ziskin and studio head Bill Mechanic. In August 1997, 20th Century Fox announced that Fincher would direct the film adaptation of Fight Club."

        "content": "Producer Ross Bell met with actor Russell Crowe to discuss his candidacy for the role of Tyler Durden. Producer Art Linson, who joined the project late, met with Pitt regarding the same role. Linson was the senior producer of the two, so the studio sought to cast Pitt instead of Crowe. Pitt was looking for a new film after the domestic failure of his 1998 film Meet Joe Black, and the studio believed Fight Club would be more commercially successful with a major star. The studio signed Pitt for US$17.5\u00a0million. For the role of the unnamed Narrator, the studio desired a \"sexier marquee name\" such as Matt Damon to increase the film's commercial prospects; it also considered Sean Penn. Fincher instead considered Norton based on his performance in the 1996 film The People vs. Larry Flynt. Other studios were approaching Norton for leading roles in developing films like The Talented Mr. Ripley and Man on the Moon. He was cast in Runaway Jury, but the film did not reach production. 20th Century Fox offered Norton $2.5\u00a0million for Fight Club. He could not accept the offer immediately because he still owed Paramount Pictures a film; he had signed a contractual obligation with Paramount to appear in one of the studio's future films for a smaller salary. Norton later satisfied the obligation with his role in the 2003 film The Italian Job. In January 1998, 20th Century Fox announced that Pitt and Norton had been cast. The actors prepared by taking lessons in boxing, taekwondo, grappling, and soapmaking. Pitt voluntarily visited a dentist to have pieces of his front teeth chipped off so his character would not have perfect teeth. The pieces were restored after filming concluded. Fincher's first choice for the role of Marla Singer was Janeane Garofalo. While Fincher initially stated that she turned it down because she objected to the film's sexual content, in an interview in 2020, Garofolo revealed she did accept the part but was dropped because Norton believed she was poorly suited to the part. The filmmakers considered Courtney Love and Winona Ryder as early candidates. The studio wanted to cast Reese Witherspoon, but Fincher felt she was too young. He chose to cast Bonham Carter based on her performance in the 1997 film The Wings of the Dove."

        "content": "Uhls started working on a draft of the adapted screenplay, which excluded a voice-over because the industry perceived at the time that the technique was \"hackneyed and trite\". When Fincher joined the film, he thought that the film should have a voice-over, believing that the film's humor came from the Narrator's voice. He described the film without a voice-over as seemingly \"sad and pathetic\". Fincher and Uhls revised the script for six to seven months and by 1997 had a third draft that reordered the story and left out several major elements. When Pitt was cast, he was concerned that his character, Tyler Durden, was too one-dimensional. Fincher sought the advice of writer-director Cameron Crowe, who suggested giving the character more ambiguity. Fincher also hired screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker for assistance. He invited Pitt and Norton to help revise the script, and the group drafted five revisions in the course of a year. Palahniuk praised the faithful film adaptation of his novel and applauded how the film's plot was more streamlined than the book's. Palahniuk recalled how the writers debated if film audiences would believe the plot twist from the novel. Fincher supported including the twist, arguing, \"If they accept everything up to this point, they'll accept the plot twist. If they're still in the theater, they'll stay with it.\" Palahniuk's novel also contained homoerotic overtones, which Fincher included in the film to make audiences uncomfortable and accentuate the surprise of the twists. The bathroom scene where Tyler Durden bathes next to the Narrator is an example of the overtones; the line, \"I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need,\" was meant to suggest personal responsibility rather than homosexuality. Another example is the scene at the beginning of the film in which Tyler Durden puts a gun barrel down the Narrator's mouth. The Narrator finds redemption at the end of the film by rejecting Tyler Durden's dialectic, a path that diverged from the novel's ending in which the Narrator is placed in a mental institution. Norton drew parallels between redemption in the film and redemption in The Graduate, indicating that the protagonists of both films find a middle ground between two divisions of self. Fincher considered the novel too infatuated with Tyler Durden and changed the ending to move away from him: \"I wanted people to love Tyler, but I also wanted them to be OK with his vanquishing.\""

        "content": "Studio executives Mechanic and Ziskin planned an initial budget of US$23\u00a0million to finance the film, but by the start of production, the budget was increased to $50\u00a0million. Half was paid by New Regency, but during filming, the projected budget escalated to US$67\u00a0million. New Regency's head and Fight Club executive producer Arnon Milchan petitioned Fincher to reduce costs by at least US$5\u00a0million. Fincher refused, so Milchan threatened Mechanic that New Regency would withdraw financing. Mechanic sought to restore Milchan's support by sending him tapes of dailies from Fight Club. After seeing three weeks of filming, Milchan reinstated New Regency's financial backing. The final production budget was $63-65 million. The fight scenes were heavily choreographed, but the actors were required to \"go full out\" to capture realistic effects such as having the wind knocked out of them. Makeup artist Julie Pearce, who had worked for Fincher on the 1997 film The Game, studied mixed martial arts and pay-per-view boxing to portray the fighters accurately. She designed an extra's ear to have cartilage missing, inspired by the boxing match in which Mike Tyson bit off part of Evander Holyfield's ear. Makeup artists devised two methods to create sweat on cue: spraying mineral water over a coat of Vaseline, and using the unadulterated water for \"wet sweat\". Meat Loaf, who plays a fight club member who has \"bitch tits\", wore a 90-pound (40\u00a0kg) fat harness that gave him large breasts. He also wore eight-inch (20\u00a0cm) lifts in his scenes with Norton to be taller than him. Filming lasted 138 days from July to December 1998, during which Fincher shot more than 1,500 rolls of film, three times the average for a Hollywood film.  The locations were in and around Los Angeles and on sets built at the studio in Century City. Production designer Alex McDowell constructed more than 70 sets. The exterior of Tyler Durden's house was built in Wilmington, California, while the interior was built on a sound stage at the studio's location. The interior was given a decayed look to illustrate the deconstructed world of the characters. Marla Singer's apartment was based on photographs of apartments in downtown LA. Overall, production included 300 scenes, 200 locations, and complex special effects. Fincher compared Fight Club to his subsequent, less complex film Panic Room: \"I felt like I was spending all my time watching trucks being loaded and unloaded so I could shoot three lines of dialogue. There was far too much transportation going on.\""

        "content": "Fincher used the Super 35 format to film Fight Club since it gave him maximum flexibility to compose shots. He hired Jeff Cronenweth as cinematographer; Cronenweth's father Jordan Cronenweth had been cinematographer for Fincher's 1992 film Alien 3, but left midway through production due to Parkinson's disease. Fincher explored visual styles in his previous films Seven and The Game, and he and Cronenweth drew elements from these styles for Fight Club. Fincher and Cronenweth applied a lurid style, choosing to make people \"sort of shiny\". The appearance of the Narrator's scenes without Tyler were bland and realistic. The scenes with Tyler were described by Fincher as \"more hyper-real in a torn-down, deconstructed sense\u2014a visual metaphor of what [the Narrator is] heading into\". The filmmakers used heavily desaturated colors in the costuming, makeup, and art direction. Bonham Carter wore opalescent makeup to portray her romantic nihilistic character with a \"smack-fiend patina\". Fincher and Cronenweth drew influences from the 1973 film American Graffiti, which applied a mundane look to nighttime exteriors while simultaneously including a variety of colors. The crew took advantage of both natural and practical light. Fincher sought various approaches to the lighting setups; for example, he chose several urban locations for the city lights' effects on the shots' backgrounds. The crew also embraced fluorescent lighting at other practical locations to maintain an element of reality and to light the prostheses depicting the characters' injuries. On the other hand, Fincher also ensured that scenes were not so strongly lit so the characters' eyes were less visible, citing cinematographer Gordon Willis' technique as the influence. Fight Club was filmed mostly at night, and Fincher filmed the daytime shots in shadowed locations. The crew equipped the bar's basement with inexpensive work lamps to create a background glow. Fincher avoided stylish camerawork when filming early fight scenes in the basement and instead placed the camera in a fixed position. In later fight scenes, Fincher moved the camera from the viewpoint of a distant observer to that of the fighter. The scenes with Tyler were staged to conceal that the character was a mental projection of the unnamed Narrator. Tyler was not filmed in two shots with a group of people, nor was he shown in any over-the-shoulder shots in scenes where Tyler gives the Narrator specific ideas to manipulate him. In scenes before the Narrator meets Tyler, the filmmakers inserted Tyler's presence in single frames for subliminal effect. Tyler appears in the background and out of focus, like a \"little devil on the shoulder\". Fincher explained the subliminal frames: \"Our hero is creating Tyler Durden in his own mind, so at this point he exists only on the periphery of the Narrator's consciousness.\" While Cronenweth generally rated and exposed the Kodak film stock normally on Fight Club, several other techniques were applied to change its appearance. Flashing was implemented on much of the exterior night photography, the contrast was stretched to be purposely ugly, the print was adjusted to be underexposed, Technicolor's ENR silver retention was used on a select number of prints to increase the density of the blacks, and high-contrast print stocks were chosen to create a \"stepped-on\" look on the print with a dirty patina."

        "content": "Fincher hired visual effects supervisor Kevin Tod Haug, who worked for him on The Game, to create visual effects for Fight Club. Haug assigned the visual effects artists and experts to different facilities that each addressed different types of visual effects: CG modeling, animation, compositing, and scanning. Haug explained, \"We selected the best people for each aspect of the effects work, then coordinated their efforts. In this way, we never had to play to a facility's weakness.\" Fincher visualized the Narrator's perspective through a \"mind's eye\" view and structured a myopic framework for the film audiences. Fincher also used previsualized footage of challenging main-unit and visual effects shots as a problem-solving tool to avoid making mistakes during the actual filming. The film's title sequence is a 90-second visual effects composition that depicts the inside of the Narrator's brain at a microscopic level; the camera pulls back to the outside, starting at his fear center and following the thought processes initiated by his fear impulse. The sequence, designed in part by Fincher, was budgeted separately from the rest of the film at first, but the sequence was awarded by the studio in January 1999. Fincher hired Digital Domain and its visual effects supervisor Kevin Mack, who won an Academy Award for Visual Effects for the 1998 film What Dreams May Come, for the sequence. The company mapped the computer-generated brain using an L-system, and the design was detailed using renderings by medical illustrator Katherine Jones. The pullback sequence from within the brain to the outside of the skull included neurons, action potentials, and a hair follicle. Haug explained the artistic license that Fincher took with the shot, \"While he wanted to keep the brain passage looking like electron microscope photography, that look had to be coupled with the feel of a night dive\u2014wet, scary, and with a low depth of field.\" The shallow depth of field was accomplished with the ray tracing process. Other visual effects include an early scene in which the camera flashes past city streets to survey Project Mayhem's destructive equipment lying in underground parking lots; the sequence was a three-dimensional composition of nearly 100\u00a0photographs of Los Angeles and Century City by photographer Michael Douglas Middleton. The final scene of the demolition of the credit card office buildings was designed by Richard Baily of Image Savant; Baily worked on the scene for over fourteen\u00a0months. Midway through the film, Tyler Durden points out the cue mark\u2014nicknamed \"cigarette burn\" in the film\u2014to the audience. The scene represents a turning point that foreshadows the coming rupture and inversion of the \"fairly subjective reality\" that existed earlier in the film. Fincher explained: \"Suddenly it's as though the projectionist missed the changeover, the viewers have to start looking at the movie in a whole new way.\""

They did not receive the film positively and were concerned that there would not be an audience for the film. Executive producer Art Linson, who supported the film, recalled the response: \"So many incidences of Fight Club were alarming, no group of executives could narrow them down.\" Nevertheless, Fight Club was originally slated to be released in July 1999 but was later changed to August 6, 1999. The studio further delayed the film's release, this time to autumn, citing a crowded summer schedule and a hurried post-production process. Outsiders attributed the delays to the Columbine High School massacre earlier in the year. Marketing executives at Fox Searchlight Pictures faced difficulties in marketing Fight Club and at one point considered marketing it as an art film. They considered that the film was primarily geared toward male audiences because of its violence and believed that not even Pitt would attract female filmgoers. Research testing showed that the film appealed to teenagers. Fincher refused to let the posters and trailers focus on Pitt and encouraged the studio to hire the advertising firm Wieden+Kennedy to devise a marketing plan. The firm proposed a bar of pink soap with the title \"Fight Club\" embossed on it as the film's main marketing image; the proposal was considered \"a bad joke\" by Fox executives. Fincher also released two early trailers in the form of fake public service announcements presented by Pitt and Norton; the studio did not think the trailers marketed the film appropriately. Instead, the studio financed a $20\u00a0million large-scale campaign to provide a press junket, posters, billboards, and trailers for TV that highlighted the film's fight scenes. The studio advertised Fight Club on cable during World Wrestling Federation broadcasts, which Fincher protested, believing that the placement created the wrong context for the film. Linson believed that the \"ill-conceived one-dimensional\" marketing by marketing executive Robert Harper largely contributed to Fight Clubs lukewarm box office performance in the United States."

Fight Club opened commercially in the United States and Canada on October 15, 1999 and earned  in 1,963 theaters over the opening weekend. The film ranked first at the weekend box office, defeating Double Jeopardy and The Story of Us, a fellow weekend opener. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B-\" on an A+ to F scale. The gender mix of audiences for Fight Club, argued to be \"the ultimate anti-date flick\", was 61% male and 39% female; 58% of audiences were below the age of 21. Despite the film's top placement, its opening gross fell short of the studio's expectations. Over the second weekend, Fight Club dropped 42.6% in revenue, earning .

(With subsequent re-releases, the film's worldwide gross increased to .) The underwhelming North American performance of Fight Club soured the relationship between 20th Century Fox's studio head Bill Mechanic and media executive Rupert Murdoch, which contributed to Mechanic's resignation in June 2000. The British Board of Film Classification reviewed Fight Club for its November 12, 1999 release in the United Kingdom and removed two scenes involving \"an indulgence in the excitement of beating a (defenseless) man's face into a pulp\". The board assigned the film an 18 certificate, limiting the release to adult-only audiences in the UK. The BBFC did not censor any further, considering and dismissing claims that Fight Club contained \"dangerously instructive information\" and could \"encourage anti-social (behavior)\". The board decided, \"The film as a whole is\u2014quite clearly\u2014critical and sharply parodic of the amateur fascism which in part it portrays.

The film was released on DVD on June 6, 2000, in one and two-disc editions. The movie disc included four commentary tracks, while the bonus disc contained behind-the-scenes clips, deleted scenes, trailers, theater safety PSAs, the promotional music video \"This is Your Life\", Internet spots, still galleries, cast biographies, storyboards, and publicity materials. Fincher worked on the DVD as a way to finish his vision for the film. Julie Markell, 20th Century Fox's senior vice president of creative development, said the DVD packaging complemented Fincher's vision: \"The film is meant to make you question. The package, by extension, tries to reflect an experience that you must experience for yourself. The more you look at it, the more you'll get out of it.\" The studio developed the packaging for two months. The two-disc special edition DVD was packaged to look covered in brown cardboard wrapper. The title \"Fight Club\" was labeled diagonally across the front, and packaging appeared tied with twine. Markell said, \"We wanted the package to be simple on the outside, so that there would be a dichotomy between the simplicity of brown paper wrapping and the intensity and chaos of what's inside.\" Deborah Mitchell, 20th Century Fox's vice president of marketing, described the design: \"From a retail standpoint, [the DVD case] has incredible shelf-presence.\" It was the first DVD release to feature the THX Optimode. Fight Club won the 2000 Online Film Critics Society Awards for Best DVD, Best DVD Commentary, and Best DVD Special Features. Entertainment Weekly ranked the film's two-disc edition in first place on its 2001 list of \"The 50 Essential DVDs\", giving top ratings to the DVD's content and technical picture-and-audio quality. When the two-disc edition went out of print, the studio re-released it in 2004 because of fans' requests. The film sold more than 6 million copies on DVD and video within the first ten years, making it one of the largest-selling home media items in the studio's history, in addition to grossing over $55 million in video and DVD rentals. With a weak box office performance in the United States and Canada, a better performance in other territories, and the highly successful DVD release, Fight Club generated a US$10\u00a0million profit for the studio. The Laserdisc edition was only released in Japan on May 26, 2000 and features a different cover art, as well as one of the very few Dolby Digital Surround EX soundtracks released on LD. The VHS edition was released on October 31, 2002, as a part of 20th Century Fox's \"Premiere Series\" line. It includes a featurette after the film, \"Behind the Brawl\". Fight Club was released in the Blu-ray Disc format in the United States on November 17, 2009. Five graffiti artists were commissioned to create 30 pieces of art for the packaging, encompassing urban aesthetics found on the East Coast and West Coast of the United States as well as influences from European street art. The Blu-ray edition opens with a menu screen for the romantic comedy Never Been Kissed starring Drew Barrymore before leading into the Fight Club menu screen. Fincher got permission from Barrymore to include the fake menu screen. An online release in China from Tencent replaced the ending with a message that Project Mayhem was thwarted, with Tyler Durden being arrested by law enforcement and placed in an insane asylum until 2012, adapting the ending of the original Fight Club novel. Weeks later, Tencent released a version of the film restoring 11 of the 12 minutes that had previously been cut."

        "content": "When Fight Club premiered at the 56th Venice International Film Festival, the film was fiercely debated by critics. A newspaper reported, \"Many loved and hated it in equal measures.\" Some critics expressed concern that the film would incite copycat behavior, such as that seen after A Clockwork Orange debuted in Britain nearly three decades previously. Upon the film's theatrical release, The Times reported the reaction: \"It touched a nerve in the male psyche that was debated in newspapers across the world.\" Although the film's makers called Fight Club \"an accurate portrayal of men in the 1990s,\" some critics called it \"irresponsible and appalling.\" Writing for The Australian, Christopher Goodwin stated: \"Fight Club is shaping up to be the most contentious mainstream Hollywood meditation on violence since Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange.\" Janet Maslin, reviewing for The New York Times, praised Fincher's direction and editing of the film. She wrote that Fight Club carried a message of \"contemporary manhood\", and that, if not watched closely, the film could be misconstrued as an endorsement of violence and nihilism. Roger Ebert, reviewing for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave Fight Club two stars out of four, calling it \"visceral and hard-edged\", but also \"a thrill ride masquerading as philosophy\", whose promising first act is followed by a second that panders to macho sensibilities and a third he dismissed as \"trickery\". Ebert later acknowledged that the film was \"beloved by most, not by me\". He was later requested to have a shot-by-shot analysis of Fight Club at the Conference on World Affairs; he stated that \"[s]eeing it over the course of a week, I admired its skill even more, and its thought even less.\" Jay Carr of The Boston Globe opined that the film began with an \"invigoratingly nervy and imaginative buzz\", but that it eventually became \"explosively silly\". Newsweeks David Ansen described Fight Club as \"an outrageous mixture of brilliant technique, puerile philosophizing, trenchant satire and sensory overload\" and thought that the ending was too pretentious. Richard Schickel of Time described the mise en sc\u00e8ne as dark and damp: \"It enforces the contrast between the sterilities of his characters' aboveground life and their underground one. Water, even when it's polluted, is the source of life; blood, even when it's carelessly spilled, is the symbol of life being fully lived. To put his point simply: it's better to be wet than dry.\" Schickel applauded the performances of Pitt and Norton, but criticized the \"conventionally gimmicky\" unfolding and the failure to make Bonham Carter's character interesting. Cineastes Gary Crowdus reviewed the critical reception in retrospect: \"Many critics praised Fight Club, hailing it as one of the most exciting, original, and thought-provoking films of the year.\" He wrote of the negative opinion, \"While Fight Club had numerous critical champions, the film's critical attackers were far more vocal, a negative chorus which became hysterical about what they felt to be the excessively graphic scenes of fisticuffs\u00a0... They felt such scenes served only as a mindless glamorization of brutality, a morally irresponsible portrayal, which they feared might encourage impressionable young male viewers to set up their own real-life fight clubs in order to beat each other senseless.\" Fight Club was nominated for the 2000 Academy Award for Best Sound Editing, but it lost to The Matrix. Bonham Carter won the 2000 Empire Award for Best British Actress. The Online Film Critics Society also nominated Fight Club for Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor (Norton), Best Editing, and Best Adapted Screenplay (Uhls). Though the film won none of the awards, the organization listed Fight Club as one of the top ten films of 1999. The soundtrack was nominated for a BRIT Award, losing to Notting Hill. On Rotten Tomatoes, Fight Club holds an approval rating of 79% based on 180 reviews, with an average rating of 7.40/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Solid acting, amazing direction, and elaborate production design make Fight Club a wild ride.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\"."

After Fight Clubs theatrical release, it became more popular via word of mouth, and the positive reception of the DVD established it as a cult film that David Ansen of Newsweek conjectured would enjoy \"perennial\" fame. The film's success also heightened Palahniuk's profile to global renown. Following Fight Clubs release, several fight clubs were reported to have started in the United States. A \"Gentleman's Fight Club\" was started in Menlo Park, California, in 2000 and had members mostly from the tech industry. Teens and preteens in Texas, New Jersey, Washington state, and Alaska also initiated fight clubs and posted videos of their fights online, leading authorities to break up the clubs. In 2006, an unwilling participant from a local high school was injured at a fight club in Arlington, Texas, and the DVD sales of the fight led to the arrest of six teenagers. An unsanctioned fight club was also started at Princeton University, where matches were held on campus. The film was suspected of influencing Luke Helder, a college student who planted pipe bombs in mailboxes in 2002. Helder's goal was to create a smiley pattern on the map of the United States, similar to the scene in Fight Club in which a building is vandalized to have a smiley on its exterior. On July 16, 2009, a 17-year-old who had formed his own fight club in Manhattan was charged with detonating a homemade bomb outside a Starbucks Coffee shop in the Upper East Side. The New York City Police Department reported the suspect was trying to emulate \"Project Mayhem\". Fight Club had a significant impact on evangelical Christianity, in the areas of Christian discipleship and masculinity. A number of churches called their cell groups \"fight clubs\" with a stated purpose of meeting regularly to \"beat up the flesh and believe the gospel of grace\". Some churches, especially Mars Hill Church in Seattle, whose pastor Mark Driscoll was obsessed with the film, picked up the film's emphasis on masculinity, and rejection of self-care. Jessica Johnson suggests that Driscoll even called on \"his brothers-in-arms to foment a movement not unlike Project Mayhem.\" A Fight Club video game was released by Vivendi Universal Games in 2004 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and for mobile phones. The game was a critical and commercial failure, and was panned by such publications and websites as GameSpot, Game Informer, and IGN. The video game Jet Set Radio, initially released in 2000 for Sega's Dreamcast console, was inspired by the film's anti-establishment themes. In 2003, Fight Club was listed as one of the \"50 Best Guy Movies of All Time\" by Men's Journal. In 2004 and 2006, Fight Club was voted by Empire readers as the eighth and tenth greatest film of all time, respectively. Total Film ranked Fight Club as \"The Greatest Film of our Lifetime\" in 2007 during the magazine's tenth anniversary. In 2007, Premiere selected Tyler Durden's line, \"The first rule of fight club is you do not talk about fight club,\" as the 27th greatest movie line of all time. In 2008, readers of Empire ranked Tyler Durden eighth on a list of the 100 Greatest Movie Characters. Empire also identified Fight Club as the 10th greatest movie of all time in its 2008 issue The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time. In 2010, two viral mash-up videos featuring Fight Club were released. Ferris Club was a mash-up of Fight Club and the 1986 film Ferris Bueller's Day Off. It portrayed Ferris as Tyler Durden and Cameron as the narrator, \"claiming to see the real psychological truth behind the John Hughes classic\". The second video Jane Austen's Fight Club also gained popularity online as a mash-up of Fight Clubs fighting rules and the characters created by 19th-century novelist Jane Austen."

        "content": "\"She of Little Faith\" is the sixth episode of the thirteenth season of the American animated television series The Simpsons. It first aired in the United States on the Fox network on December 16, 2001. In the episode, Bart Simpson and his father Homer accidentally launch a model rocket into the Springfield church, causing the church council to accept funding plans from Mr. Burns for reparation. Discontent with how commercialized the rebuilt church has become, Lisa abandons Christianity and seeks out to follow a new religion. The episode was directed by  Steven Dean Moore and written by Bill Freiberger, whom executive producer and show runner Al Jean had met while working on the television series Teen Angel. The plot idea for the episode was pitched by Jean, who wanted to expand on Lisa's personality, even though some of the Simpsons writers were concerned over the episode's originality. Lisa has remained a Buddhist since this episode. The episode features actor Richard Gere, who agreed to star as long as Buddhism was portrayed accurately, and as long as Lisa would say \"Free Tibet\". The episode was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour) in 2002, which it ultimately lost to the Futurama episode, \"Roswell That Ends Well\". Following the thirteenth season's release on DVD and Blu-ray, the episode received mostly positive reviews from critics."

        "content": "While watching a 1950s science fiction movie, Bart and Lisa see a commercial for a model rocket kit and Bart orders it by using Homer's credit card number. Homer helps Bart and Milhouse build it, but it blows up before launching. Jealous that Ned Flanders built a superior rocket, Homer enlists the help of his former nerdy college roommates, Gary, Doug, and Benjamin, to build a rocket piloted by the hamster Nibbles. The rocket lifts off successfully, but it develops complications and Nibbles bails out. Homer attempts to shoot down the rocket with a 12 gauge shotgun, but the rocket crashes into the church. The church council meets up to decide how to come up with money to fund the repairs to the church. With no other aid available, they accept help from Mr. Burns and Lindsay Naegle, who wish to run the church as a business. The two rebuild the church as a commercial monstrosity, complete with advertising signs, a currency exchanger, a Lard Lad statue, a photo booth for the churchgoers to put their faces in a cut-out of Jesus from The Last Supper, and a Jumbotron known as \"Godcam\". Lisa is appalled at this and after Lovejoy welcomes The Noid to hold a sermon \"on the sanctity of deliciousness,\" she abandons the church, feeling her religion has lost its soul. That night, Lisa prays to God and assures him she has not turned her back on Him, but plans to seek a new path to \u201cHim\u201d (or \u201cHer,\u201d she says). While on a walk around town, passing many sacrilegious signs, she finds Springfield's Buddhist temple. Inside she sees Lenny and Carl meditating, and Hollywood actor Richard Gere teaches the core concepts of Buddhism to her. An intrigued Lisa takes a pamphlet on Buddhism and studies it at home. It convinces her of the virtues of the faith, and Lisa announces out her window she has become, and forever will be, a Buddhist. Lisa plants her own bodhi tree in the back yard and begins to meditate, but Marge grows increasingly worried about Lisa's soul and tries to convince her to come back to Christianity. At the church council meeting, Reverend Lovejoy tells Marge to use Christmas to bribe her back. Marge bakes cookies, decorates the home, and has Ralph and Milhouse dress as a pony in wrapping paper to tempt her, but Lisa runs from the home when she realizes what is happening. At the Buddhist temple, she tells Gere her family tried to trick her, but Gere informs her that while Buddhism is about one finding inner peace, it is also about respecting the diversity of other religions based on love and compassion. Thus, Lisa is free to celebrate any holiday with her family, including Christmas. Lisa goes back home, falling asleep beside the Christmas tree and tells everyone that she will be celebrating Christmas with them and continue paying lip service to Christianity while practicing Buddhism for the rest of her life. As Marge takes her to the kitchen to get some cookies for her, Lisa asks about her pony, and Marge tries unsuccessfully to change the subject as Lisa calls out for her gift."

        "content": "\"She of Little Faith\" was directed by Steven Dean Moore and was the only episode Bill Freiberger wrote for The Simpsons. It was first broadcast on Fox in the United States on December 16, 2001. Before returning to work full-time on The Simpsons, Jean had worked on a television series called Teen Angel together with Mike Reiss and Freiberger. While working on Teen Angel, Freiberger suggested that, if Jean was ever to run The Simpsons, he should hire Freiberger as a writer on the series. For the thirteenth season, Jean became show runner and assigned Freiberger to write the episode. Freiberger wrote the first draft as a freelance script at his parents' barn in Pennsylvania, and when he returned to the writing staff to rewrite the story, Freiberger took so many notes that the script became 106 pages long. As a result, Freiberger spent more time editing down the script rather than writing it. The episode's main plot, in which Lisa becomes a Buddhist, was pitched by Jean, who wanted to expand Lisa's personality. When he pitched the plot idea to the Simpsons writing staff, they became concerned about the episode's originality. They argued that the series had already explored religious themes in earlier episodes, but Jean assured them that the episode would be about Lisa first-and-foremost, rather than Buddhism. Unlike several other episodes in the series in which a character undergoes a change in their personality, Lisa has remained a Buddhist since this episode, much like her conversion to vegetarianism in \"Lisa the Vegetarian\". Freiberger pitched the subplot involving the model rockets in the beginning of the episode. He based it on a real-life experience, in which he, as a child, accidentally launched a model rocket into a window in his house. A scene from this subplot was removed from the episode following the September 11 attacks. The scene would show a man named Hassan Jay Salam being arrested by policemen (who tells them to call his cousin Casey Kasem), who think the rocket Bart and Homer launched was launched by him (The rocket bears the abbreviation HJS, which stands for Homer J Simpson). After the attacks, the scene was considered too offensive by the Fox censors, so the scene was removed. Originally, the subplot would involve Marge trying to get Homer to build model rockets with Bart. Homer would not want to at first, but after Marge convinces him, he would soon get more into it than Bart. The plot idea was encouraged by some of the writers who thought that Marge had \"gotten short shrift,\" and, according to Freiberger, Marge would have had a \"really big part motivating the story\" had the subplot remained intact. The renovated church in the episode is built like a mall; several stores and merchandising is located inside, and Reverend Lovejoy plugs products and television programs during his sermons. The scene is used to satirize the so-called \"megachurches\" and the commercialization sometimes associated with these institutions. The episode also argues that, even if Christmas has lost most of its meaning, it is more important to \"keep these thoughts to oneself in order to make the family happy.\" It also comments on what the writers believe to be the \"all or nothing, we're right, you're all going to hell mentality\" of some Christian movements. Even though \"She of Little Faith\" is a Christmas episode, the holiday is not mentioned until the episode's third act. Jean stated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode that the writers did not want to make a conventional Christmas episode, and instead wanted to \"slide into\" the subject. The episode features actor Richard Gere as himself. Gere agreed to guest star under two conditions, the first being that Buddhism should be portrayed accurately, and his second and strongest request being that Lisa should say \"Free Tibet\" in the episode. Jean agreed, but Gere ended up with the line. However, Lisa did yell out \"Free Tibet\" in an episode in the following season. Gere's lines were recorded in New York City by Jean who, in the DVD audio commentary for the episode, stated that Gere was \"great\" and that he \"didn't mind being made fun of\" in the episode. He also mentioned that Gere was one of the only guest-stars they had that \"looked handsome simpsonized.\""

Matt Groening, creator of both series, joked that the award \"gave [him] a chance to be bitter either way\". On August 24, 2010, the episode was released as part of The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season DVD and Blu-ray set. Following its home video release, \"She of Little Faith\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Dominic von Reidermann of Suite101.com considered the episode to be a \"comedy gem\" and Casey Burchby of DVD Talk wrote that it \"offers its fair share of laughs\". Stuart O' Conner of Screen Jabber was also favorable, calling it a \"first-rate\" episode. Writing for Obsessed With Film, Adam Rayner derided Gere's performance as being \"bland and dreary\", however he went on to write that it couldn't ruin the episode, which he described as \"great\". He especially liked Flanders' line \"My Satan sense is tingling.\" Jennifer Malkowski, who gave the episode a B-, wrote that the episode's \"highlight\" was a scene in which \"Milhouse mourns his 'beautiful eyebrows'\" that were burned off by Bart and Homer's model rocket. In 2007, Simon Crerar of The Times listed Gere's performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos in the history of the show. Ron Martin of 411Mania, who consider episodes about Lisa to be \"traditional channel changers\", wrote that it \"offers one of the worst \u2018Lisa episodes\u2019\" of the series. Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide criticized the episode for being \"little more than a retread\" of earlier episodes of the series. He argued that the episode borrows plot elements from both \"Lisa the Vegetarian\", \"Lisa's Pony\" and \"Grift of the Magi\", and went on to write that the episode is \"a pretty unoriginal piece of work\". He concluded his review by writing that the episode \"fails to deliver more than a chuckle or two\"."

Ernst Ganz (Ludwig Donath), the elderly Jewish man that Vollmer has had a sympathetic, uncle-like relationship with since he was an abused and neglected kid, offers him shelter and compassion but not respect. Ernst spent nine years in Dachau and recognizes that Vollmer's politics stem from a childish desire for the respect of others. This pains Vollmer, who openly confesses that he views Ernst as a father figure, since his real father physically abused him and his mother was never around. Beginning one night, Vollmer is periodically visited by a shadowy figure who teaches him how to enthrall a crowd. The figure teaches Vollmer how to speak, and pays Vollmer's rent at the hall where he holds rallies. He also instructs Vollmer to arrange the death of one of his followers, Nick, thereby creating a martyr to rally everyone around (a reference to the 1930 murder of Horst Wessel, a low-ranking officer in the Sturmabteilung). Following the figure's instructions and assistance, Vollmer becomes considerably more successful and his group's following grows. Ernst becomes fearful that Vollmer may actually succeed in igniting another Holocaust. He disrupts a rally, accusing Vollmer of being \"nothing but a cheap copy\" of the German F\u00fchrer while Vollmer cowers before his surrogate father. After the failed rally, the shadowy figure rebukes Vollmer for his failure and says that from now on he will be ordering Vollmer rather than instructing him. Vollmer demands to know who his mysterious benefactor is. The man steps forward from the shadows to reveal himself to be Adolf Hitler (Curt Conway). He orders Vollmer to kill Ernst, and Vollmer steels himself enough to complete the task. Hitler congratulates him and asks how it felt; Vollmer replies that he felt immortal. Hitler responds, \"Mr. Vollmer! We ARE immortal!\" Police officers arrive soon after, to arrest Vollmer for conspiracy to murder Nick. Shot while fleeing, Vollmer is astonished by the sight of his own blood. Hitler's shadow appears on the wall behind the dying Vollmer as he gasps out, \"There's something very wrong here... Don't you understand that I'm made out of steel!?\""

        "content": "The Simpsons Movie is a 2007 American animated comedy film based on the long-running animated sitcom The Simpsons. The film was directed by the show's supervising director David Silverman and stars the show's regular cast of Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer, Tress MacNeille, Pamela Hayden, Karl Wiedergott, Marcia Wallace, Maggie Roswell, Russi Taylor, Joe Mantegna, and Albert Brooks. The film follows Homer Simpson, who irresponsibly pollutes the lake in Springfield, causing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to imprison the town under a giant glass dome. After he and his family escape, they ultimately abandon Homer for his selfishness and return to Springfield to prevent the town\u2019s demolition by Russ Cargill, head of the EPA. Homer works to redeem his folly by returning to Springfield himself in an effort to save it. Although previous attempts to create a Simpsons film had been made, they failed due to the lack of lengthy script and production crew members. Eventually in 2001, producers James L. Brooks, Matt Groening, Al Jean, Mike Scully and Richard Sakai began development of the film and a writing team consisting of Brooks, Groening, Jean, Scully, Ian Maxtone-Graham, George Meyer, David Mirkin, Mike Reiss, Matt Selman, John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti was assembled. They conceived numerous plot ideas, with Groening's being the one adapted. The script was rewritten over a hundred times, also continuing after work on the animation began in 2006. Consequently, hours of finished material was cut from the final release, including cameo roles from Erin Brockovich, Minnie Driver, Isla Fisher, and Edward Norton (as well as Kelsey Grammer, who would have reprised his role as Sideshow Bob). Tom Hanks and the members of Green Day voice their own animated counterparts in the final cut of the film, while Albert Brooks, a frequent guest performer on the series, provides the voice of its main antagonist, Russ Cargill. Tie-in promotions were made with several companies to promote the film's release, including Burger King and 7-Eleven, the latter of which transformed selected stores into Kwik-E-Marts. The film premiered in Springfield, Vermont on July 21, 2007 and was released theatrically six days later by 20th Century Fox across the United States. The Simpsons Movie received positive reviews and grossed $536.4 million worldwide, became the eighth highest-grossing film of 2007, the second highest-grossing traditionally animated film (behind Walt Disney Animation Studios' The Lion King), and the highest-ever grossing film based on an animated television series.  The film received praise for its humor, emotional weight, and callbacks to early seasons. The film was nominated for numerous awards, including a Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film at the 65th Golden Globe Awards."

During their memorial at Reverend Lovejoy's church, Grampa Simpson has a spiritual experience and frantically prophesies that a disaster will befall Springfield, but only Marge takes it seriously. Concerned about the terrible state of the environment, Lisa and her new love interest, Colin, hold a seminar where they successfully convince Mayor Quimby to tell the town to clean up the lake. Meanwhile, after a series of dares, including one with Bart skateboarding across Springfield naked and getting in trouble with Chief Wiggum, Homer and Bart go to Krusty Burger, where Homer adopts a pig that Krusty the Clown was about to have killed. Marge, identifying the pig as a part of Grampa's prophecy, warns Homer to get rid of it, but Homer refuses. Homer's fawning over the pig makes Bart, now fed up with his father's carelessness, look to their neighbor, Ned Flanders, as a father figure. Homer stores the pig's feces in an overflowing silo, disgusting Marge. Homer attempts to dispose of it safely at Marge's request, but his friend Lenny calls him to inform him about Lard Lad Donuts giving away all their donuts for free due to failing a health inspection. In a rush to get to the giveaway, Homer dumps the silo in the lake, critically polluting it. Moments later, a squirrel stumbles into it and becomes severely mutated. While bonding on a hike, Bart and Flanders notice the squirrel, which the EPA capture. Russ Cargill, head of the EPA, informs President Arnold Schwarzenegger on Springfield's pollution crisis and presents five solutions. Without reading them, the president randomly picks the third solution: imprisoning Springfield under a giant glass dome. When Homer's silo is discovered, the townspeople, including Grampa, the school staff, the Simpsons' friends and neighbors, except for the Flanders and Colin, form an angry mob, ransack their house and attempt to lynch them. The family escapes through a sinkhole that Homer hid using Maggie's sandbox, which destroys the house soon after. The family flees to Alaska using a truck that Lisa helps Homer win at a contest, where they try to restart their life. Within ninety three days, Springfield completely exhausts its daily supplies and the townspeople go crazy as they attempt to escape from the dome using brute force to destroy it, causing cracks to form. Cargill, not wanting news of what he has done to spread around the world, plots to destroy Springfield by tricking the president into choosing a solution that involves its demolition. The Simpsons see a television advertisement for a new Grand Canyon on the site of Springfield. Realizing that their hometown is in danger, the family decide to save it except for Homer, who objects to helping the people who had turned on them. The family soon abandons Homer for his selfishness, with Marge leaving behind a recorded video about it, causing him to run off in search of them. The family are captured by the EPA and placed back inside the dome. After an encounter with a mysterious Inuit shaman who saves him from a polar bear, Homer has an epiphany about saving the town in order to save himself. Homer returns home and learns about his family's capture as a helicopter lowers a time bomb suspended by a rope through a hole at the top of the dome. Homer enters the dome and descends the rope, knocking the escaping townspeople and the bomb off, inadvertently shortening its countdown, much to the townspeople's anger. After reuniting and reconciling with Bart, they use a motorcycle to travel up the side of the dome and throw the bomb through the hole seconds before it detonates, shattering the dome and freeing the town. Homer and Bart land safely at Springfield Gorge where a shotgun-wielding Cargill confronts them and attempts to shoot them for foiling his plan. But before he can do so, Maggie knocks him out by dropping a large rock on his head. The townspeople praise and forgive Homer, who reconciles with Marge as Springfield begins restoration."

        "content": "The production staff had considered a film adaptation of The Simpsons since early in the series. The show's creator, Matt Groening, felt a feature-length film would allow them to increase the show's scale and animate sequences too complex for the TV series. He intended the film to be made after the show ended, \"but that [...] was undone by good ratings\". There were attempts to adapt the fourth season episode \"Kamp Krusty\" into a film, but difficulties were encountered in expanding the episode to feature-length. For a long time the project was held up. There was difficulty finding a story that was sufficient for a film, and the crew did not have enough time to complete such a project, as they already worked full-time on the show. Groening also expressed a wish to make Simpstasia, a parody of Fantasia; it was never produced, partly because it would have been too difficult to write a feature-length script. At another point, it was briefly suggested to do an anthology-style Treehouse of Horror film, but such suggestion was never pursued. Recurring guest performer Phil Hartman had wished to make a live-action film based on his character Troy McClure; several of the show's staff expressed a desire to help create it, and Josh Weinstein proposed to use the plot of the 1996 episode \"A Fish Called Selma\" for the film, but the project was cancelled following Hartman's death in 1998. The voice cast was signed on to do the film in 2001, and work then began on the script. The producers were initially worried that creating a film would have a negative effect on the series, as they did not have enough crew to focus their attention on both projects. As the series progressed, additional writers and animators were hired so that both the show and the film could be produced at the same time. Groening and James L. Brooks invited back Mike Scully and Al Jean (who continued to work as showrunner on the television series) to produce the film with them. They then signed David Silverman (who, in anticipation of the project, had quit his job at Pixar) to direct the film. The \"strongest possible\" writing team was assembled, with many of the writers from the show's early seasons being chosen. David Mirkin, Mike Reiss, George Meyer, John Swartzwelder, and Jon Vitti were selected. Ian Maxtone-Graham and Matt Selman joined later, and Brooks, Groening, Scully, and Jean also wrote parts of the script. Sam Simon did not return having left the show over creative differences in 1993. Former writer Conan O'Brien expressed interest in working with the Simpsons staff again, although he later joked that \"I worry that the Simpsons-writing portion of my brain has been destroyed after 14 years of talking to Lindsay Lohan and that guy from One Tree Hill, so maybe it's all for the best.\" The same went for director Brad Bird who said he had \"entertained fantasies of asking if [he] could work on the movie\", but did not have enough time due to work on Ratatouille. The producers arranged a deal with Fox that would allow them to abandon production of the film at any point if they felt the script was unsatisfactory. Work continued on the screenplay from late 2003 onwards, taking place in the small bungalow where Groening first pitched The Simpsons in 1987. The writers spent six months discussing a plot, and each of them offered sketchy ideas. On their first brainstorming session, Scully suggested a story in which Steven Spielberg (intended to be voiced by Spielberg himself) would try to blow up Springfield so he can shoot a film with Tom Hanks (who ultimately made a guest appearance voicing himself in the finished film). It was also on this same reunion that Groening introduced the idea of Homer adopting a pet pig, inspired by a pig-waste management story he had read in the news. Jean suggested the family rescue manatees, which became the 2005 episode \"The Bonfire of the Manatees\", and there was also a notion similar to that of The Truman Show where the characters discovered their lives were a TV show. Groening rejected this, as he felt that the Simpsons should \"never become aware of themselves as celebrities\", but the idea was later used in the video game The Simpsons Game. Groening read about a town that had to get rid of pig feces in their water supply, which inspired the plot of the film. The decision for Flanders to have an important role also came early on, as Jean wished to see Bart wonder what his life would be like if Flanders were his father. Hank Scorpio, a character from the 1996 episode \"You Only Move Twice\", was originally meant to return as the main antagonist, but the staff dropped the idea and created Russ Cargill instead. Having eventually decided on the basic outline of the plot for the film, the writers then separated it into seven sections. Jean, Scully, Reiss, Swartzwelder, Vitti, Mirkin, and Meyer wrote 25 pages each, and the group met one month later to merge the seven sections into one \"very rough draft\". The film's script was written in the same way as the television series: the writers sitting around a table, pitching ideas, and trying to make each other laugh. The script went through over 100 revisions, and at one point the film was a musical. However, the songs were continually being shortened and the idea was dropped. Groening described his desire to also make the film dramatically stronger than a TV episode, saying that he wanted to \"give you something that you haven't seen before\"."

        "content": "Animation for the film began in January 2006, with the Itchy & Scratchy short being the first scene to be storyboarded. Groening rejected making either a live-action or a CGI film, calling the film's animation \"deliberately imperfect\" and \"a tribute to the art of hand-drawn animation\". The film was produced in a widescreen 2.40:1 aspect ratio, to distinguish it from the look of the television series, and colored with the largest palette the animators ever had available to them. A lot of the animation was produced using Wacom Cintiq tablets, which allowed images to be drawn directly onto a computer monitor to facilitate production. Animation production work was divided among four studios around the world: Film Roman in Burbank, California, Rough Draft Studios in Glendale, California, and AKOM and Rough Draft's division in Seoul, South Korea. As with the television series, the storyboarding, characters, background layout, and animatic parts of production, were done in America. The overseas studios completed the inbetweening, digital ink and paint, and rendered the animation to tape before being shipped back to the United States. Director David Silverman said that unlike the TV series where \"you [have] to pick and choose\", the film gave them the opportunity to \"lavish that attention [on] every single scene\". The characters have shadows, unlike in the show. Silverman and the animators looked to films such as The Incredibles, The Triplets of Belleville, and Bad Day at Black Rock for inspiration, as they were \"a great education in staging because of how the characters are placed\". They also looked for ideas for a dream sequence, in Disney films such as Dumbo and the Pluto cartoon Pluto's Judgment Day and for crowd scenes in It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. Silverman looked at some of the Simpsons episodes he had directed, primarily his two favorites, \"Homie the Clown\" and \"Three Men and a Comic Book\". Mike B. Anderson, Lauren MacMullan, Rich Moore and Steven Dean Moore each directed the animation for around a quarter of the film under Silverman's supervision, with numerous other animators working on scenes."

        "content": "For inspiration for the crowd scenes in the film, the production staff referenced a poster featuring more than 320 Simpsons characters. Groening said they tried to include every single character in the film, with 98 having speaking parts, and most members of the crowds being previously established characters instead of generic people. The series' regular voice actors: Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer, as well as semi-regular performers Tress MacNeille, Pamela Hayden, Marcia Wallace, Maggie Roswell, Russi Taylor and Karl Wiedergott, reprised their roles. Joe Mantegna returned as Fat Tony, while Albert Brooks, who supplied many guest voices in episodes, was cast as the main antagonist Russ Cargill after he told the staff that he wanted to be part of the film. For \"about a week\", Brooks was to reprise the role of Hank Scorpio, but when the character was omitted from the film, he ended up voicing Cargill himself. The cast did the first of three table readings in May 2005, and began recording every week from June 2006 until the end of production. James L. Brooks directed them for the first time since the television show's early seasons. Castellaneta found the recording sessions \"more intense\" than recording the television series and \"more emotionally dramatic\". Some scenes, such as Marge's video message to Homer, were recorded over one hundred times, leaving the voice cast exhausted. The writers had written the opening concert scene without a specific band in mind. Green Day were cast in that role having requested to guest star in the show. Tom Hanks also appears as himself in the film and accepted the offer after just one phone call. Everybody Loves Raymond creator Philip Rosenthal provides the voice of the father in the \"new Grand Canyon\" commercial with Hanks. Due to time restraints, several guests who had recorded parts were cut from the film. Minnie Driver recorded the part of a patronizing grievance counselor in a scene that ended up being cut. Edward Norton recorded the part of the man who gets crushed as the dome is implemented, performing a Woody Allen impression. The staff felt the voice was too distracting, so Castellaneta re-recorded Norton's dialogue with a different voice. Isla Fisher and Erin Brockovich also recorded cameos, but their scenes were cut. Kelsey Grammer recorded lines for Sideshow Bob, who was to appear at several different points, but these scenes were also cut. Johnny Knoxville was also touted as a possible guest star. Although he does not provide the voice, Arnold Schwarzenegger is president of the United States rather than then-President George W. Bush because, according to Groening, \"in two years\u00a0... the film [would be] out of date\". Brooks was nervous about the idea, noting that \"[Schwarzenegger's] opinion polls were way down\", and has said that they \"were [hoping] he'd make a political comeback\". The animators began by drawing an accurate caricature of Schwarzenegger, but one of the staff instead suggested an altered version of recurring character Rainier Wolfcastle as President. This idea was developed, with the design of Wolfcastle, himself also a caricature of Schwarzenegger, being given more wrinkles under his eyes and a different hairstyle."

        "content": "Every aspect of the film was constantly analyzed, with storylines, jokes and characters regularly being rewritten. Although most animated films do not make extensive changes to the film during active production due to budget restrictions, The Simpsons Movie crew continued to edit their film into 2007, with some edits taking place as late as May, two months before the film was released. James L. Brooks noted, \"70 percent of the things in [one of the trailers]\u2014based on where we were eight weeks ago\u2014are no longer in the movie.\" Groening said that enough material for two more films was cut. Various new characters were created, and then cut because they did not contribute enough. Originally Marge was the character who had the prophetic vision in church. The writers however considered this to be too dark and it was changed to Grampa. The role of Lisa's love interest Colin was frequently revised. He was previously named Dexter and Adrien, and his appearance was completely altered. One idea was to have Milhouse act as Lisa's love interest, but the writers realized \"the audience was not as familiar with [his] long-standing crush on [Lisa] as [they had] thought\". A car chase in which Homer throws flaming mummies out of a truck at the EPA was replaced with \"more emotional and realistic\" scenes at the motel and carnival that allowed for a change of pace. The scene of a naked Bart on his skateboard was Groening's idea, who had always wanted to have Bart skateboarding naked, and Scully had the idea of showing Bart's penis for two seconds. Storyboard Michael Archer was credited for devising the way to cover Bart's genitals with different things before they are exposed to the viewer. While the crew agreed that the gag would be funny, they wondered it if would mean an R-rating for the film, as they were happy with a PG-13 rating and that gag was nonsexual and silly. They were ultimately to get away with the joke because it wasn't live-action nor was it Homer's genitals. Further changes were made after the March 2007 preview screenings of the film in Portland, Oregon and Phoenix, Arizona. This included the deletion of Kang and Kodos heavily criticizing the film during the end credits. A lot of people at the screenings found the original film too coarse, and some of Homer's behavior too unkind, so several scenes were toned down to make him appear nicer. Russ Cargill was redesigned several times, originally appearing as an older man whose speech patterns Albert Brooks based on Donald Rumsfeld. The older model was the one used by Burger King for the action figure. Cargill's scene with Bart and Homer at the film's conclusion was added in to fully resolve his story, and the \"Spider-Pig\" gag was also a late addition. One excised scene, before the dome is put over Springfield, had Mr. Burns reminding viewers that it was the last point in the film that they could get a refund. Other deletions included Homer's encounter with a sausage truck driver, which was featured on the DVD, a scene with Plopper the pig at the end, and a news report, showing the dome's effect on daily life in Springfield in areas such as farming and sport, was cut because it did not fit the overall context of the film. Several musical numbers, at various intervals throughout the film, were cut. These included a song about Alaska, featuring music by Dave Stewart of Eurythmics. Jean said it \"got pretty far along in the animation, and then we got scared that the movie began to drag in that section.\""

Zimmer felt that the score was a \"unique challenge\", and he had to \"try and express the style of The Simpsons without wearing the audience out\". He used Danny Elfman's original opening theme, but did not wish to overuse it. He created themes for each member of the family. Homer's leitmotif was a major focus, and Zimmer also composed smaller themes for Bart and Marge. Regular television series composer Alf Clausen was not asked to score the film, noting: \"sometimes you're the windshield, sometimes you're the bug\". In addition to their appearance in the film, Green Day recorded its own version of the Simpsons theme, and released it as a single. Zimmer turned the Spider-Pig song into a choral piece, which was a joke he never intended to be put into the film. Zimmer also had to write foreign-language lyrics for the 32 dubbed versions of the song when the film was released internationally. He found translating the song into Spanish the hardest to write. The same choir learned to sing the piece for each of the foreign-language dubs."

        "content": "Al Jean described the film's message as being \"a man should listen to his wife\". In addition, the film parodies two major contemporary issues, religion and environmentalism. The theme of environmentalism is present throughout the film: in Homer's polluting of Lake Springfield, Green Day's cameo, Lisa's activism and her romance with Colin. The villainous Russ Cargill is head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Reviewer Ed Gonzalez argued the plot was a satire of the government's reaction to the effects of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans. Ian Nathan of Empire magazine criticized this focus, believing it gave the film an \"overt political agenda [which] border[s] on polemic\". James D. Bloom of Muhlenberg College commented on the \"explicitness\" of the film's \"intellectual agenda\", on this issue, shown particularly through Lisa. He wrote that the film's first post-opening credits scene, which sees Green Day fail in an attempt to engage their audience on the issue of the environment, \"sets in motion a plot expressly built around cultural agenda-setting\" and \"reflection on timely 'issues'.\" Religion is focused on in Grampa's momentary possession, and Marge believing what he said to be a message from God. Groening joked the film \"posit[s] the existence of a very active God\", when asked if he believed it was likely to offend. Mark I. Pinsky, author of The Gospel According to The Simpsons, said the film \"treats genuine faith with respect, while keeping a sharp eye out for religious pretension and hypocrisy of all kinds\". Regarding the scene where the tenants of Moe's Tavern and the Church switch locations, he believed it took the \"chance to unmask everyone's human fallibility.\" In analyzing the role of Ned Flanders, he wrote, \"It is [the] willingness of The Simpsons to depict all the different sides of us [...] that makes it so rich and funny on our complicated relationship with religion.\" Trees are a motif in the film, and they were implemented in every important or emotional scene throughout the film. The animators inserted an apple tree behind Lisa and Colin during their initial meeting, which was a reference to the biblical figures of Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden."

        "content": "Many cultural references and allusions are made throughout the film. Green Day play \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\" on violins as their barge sinks, in a sequence parodying the film Titanic. When Bart is riding his skateboard naked, different passing objects are almost constantly covering his genitalia, a nod to similar techniques used in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery. Homer and Marge's love scene parodies many Disney films, including Cinderella, with Disney-style animals helping them undress. Originally, the music from The Wizard of Oz was used in that scene, and the fawn had white spots; these were removed because the animators felt it resembled Bambi too clearly. Bart impersonates Mickey Mouse on the train, calling himself \"the mascot of an evil corporation\". Homer plays Grand Theft Walrus, an allusion to the video game series Grand Theft Auto. In the game, his character shoots a tap-dancing penguin in reference to the film Happy Feet. The \"Spider-Pig\" song is a parody of the theme song of the 1967 Spider-Man TV series, and the name of Lisa's lecture is An Irritating Truth, a play on Al Gore's film An Inconvenient Truth. The bomb disposal robot was based on Vincent D'Onofrio's character Leonard \"Pyle\" Lawrence from the film Full Metal Jacket, who commits suicide in a similar way. At the end of the film, the crowd's celebration is similar to the conclusion of Return of the Jedi, with Carl performing exactly the same hand gestures as Lando Calrissian. The $1,000 Homer received when entering Alaska is a reference to the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend. As Homer leaves Eski-Moe's he grabs on to a passing truck and uses it to propel himself back to the house, a tribute to actor Buster Keaton, while the epiphany scene features homages to the film Brazil and the works of Salvador Dal\u00ed. Hillary Clinton appears as Itchy's vice president, while an Orc from The Lord of the Rings appears in the mob scene. A scene that was cut had Marge and the kids appear on the TV talk show The View to spread the news of Springfield's impending doom. Parts were written for the show's entire panel and the scene was planned to feature Russ Cargill having a gunfight with Joy Behar. Another dropped scene featured Moe describing Springfield's varying physical states inside the dome, one of which was the Disneyland ride Autopia. There are several references to events in previous TV episodes of The Simpsons. These include the wreckage of the ambulance from the episode \"Bart the Daredevil\" crashed into a tree next to Springfield Gorge. The Carpenters' song \"(They Long to Be) Close to You\" was used in Homer and Marge's wedding video and had also been used in several emotional moments between them in the TV series."

Little information about the plot was released in the weeks building up to the film's release. Groening did not feel that \"people look in the TV section of the newspaper and think, 'I'll watch this week's Simpsons because I like the plot.' You just tune in and see what happens.\" Fox held a competition among 16 Springfields across the United States to host the American premiere. Each Springfield produced a film, explaining why their town should host the premiere, with the results being decided via a vote on the USA Today website. Springfield, Minnesota dropped out on May 31, 2007. The winner was announced on July 10 to be Springfield, Vermont. The town beat Springfield, Illinois by 15,367 votes to 14,634. Each of the other 14 entrants held their own smaller screenings of the film on July 26. Springfield, Vermont hosted the world premiere of the film on July 21 with a yellow carpet instead of the traditional red. The film was rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for \"irreverent humor throughout\"; the production staff had expected this rating. However, the British Board of Film Classification passed the film as a PG with no cuts made. A BBFC spokeswoman said regarding Bart's brief nude scene, \"natural nudity with no sexual content is acceptable in PG films\". The film was banned in Myanmar, not for the scene of nudity, but for the excessive use of the colors yellow and red, which is prohibited in the country."

Homer performed a special animated opening monologue for the edition of July 24, 2007 of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, as part of another promotion. Promotions also occurred around the world. 20th Century Fox erected a \"giant pink donut\" in the town of Springfield in Canterbury, New Zealand to celebrate being named Springfield, while in London a double decker-sized floating inflatable Spider Pig was set up by the Battersea Power Station. In Dorset, England, an image of Homer was painted next to the hill figure, the Cerne Abbas Giant. This caused outrage amongst local neopagans who performed \"rain magic\" to try to get it washed away. McFarlane Toys released a line of action figures based on the film while EA Games released The Simpsons Game to coincide with the film's DVD release, although the plot of the game was not based on the film.

And it boasts slicker animation and polished writing that hearkens back to the show's glory days.\" On Metacritic, it received a score of 80 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2013\" on an A+ to F scale. British newspapers The Guardian and The Times both gave the film four out of five stars. The Times' James Bone said that it \"boasts the same sly cultural references and flashes of brilliance that have earned the television series a following that ranges from tots to comparative literature PhDs\". The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw stated that it \"gives you everything you could possibly want\" and that he thought, \"Eighty-five minutes [was] not long enough to do justice to 17 years of comedy genius\". Ed Gonzalez praised the film for its political message, likening the Itchy & Scratchy cartoon at the beginning to President Schwarzenegger's situation later on, as well as the film's visual gags. Randy Shulman praised the cast, and described them as having \"elevated their vocal work to a craft that goes way beyond simple line readings\", and particularly praised Kavner who he said \"gave what must be the most heartfelt performance ever\". Roger Ebert gave a positive review of three out of four stars, but admitted he was \"generally [not] a fan of movies spun off from TV animation\". He called it \"radical and simple at the same time, subversive and good-hearted, offensive without really meaning to be\". Richard Corliss of Time said that the film \"doesn't try to be ruder or kinkier, just bigger and better\". USA Today film critic Claudia Puig said that the story did \"warrant a full-length feature, thanks to a clever plot and non-stop irreverent humor\". Patrick Kolan believed that the film was \"easily the best stuff to come [from the Simpsons] since season 12 or 13\" and praised the animation, but also said that the appearances of characters such as Comic Book Guy and Seymour Skinner were \"small and unfunny\". Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film's good nature, stating that the laughs \"come in all sizes\", but also noted that, \"little has been gained bringing the Simpsons to the screen.\" Variety's Brian Lowry called it \"clever, irreverent, satirical and outfitted\" but that it was \"just barely\" capable of sustaining a running time longer than a television episode. Lisa Schwarzbaum praised the voice cast but stated that the \"'action' sequences sometimes falter\". When comparing the film to the early episodes of the show, Stephen Rowley concluded that the film \"has more going for it than the show in its later years, but is still a long way short of what made it so invigorating\". The Monthly critic Luke Davies echoed Lowry's concerns about the length: \"everything moves with the whip-crack speed of a half-hour episode. And that's the paradox: it makes the film feel like three episodes strung together. We're in a cinema, and we expect something epic.\" He opined that \"in the great arc that is the history of The Simpsons, this film will come to be seen as oddity rather than apotheosis.\" More negative reception came from the magazine Empire, where reviewer Ian Nathan compared the film to New Coke, saying that \"it utterly failed\". Phil Villarreal believed that there were \"too few laugh-worthy moments\" and that \"instead of stretching to new frontiers, the film rests on the familiar\". Sheila Johnston criticized the pacing of the film and its joke level saying that \"the overall momentum flags at times\" and that it was \"a salvo of comic squibs, some very funny, others limp\". David Edwards agreed with this, writing that although \"there's a great half-hour show rattling around...the rest is padding at its very dullest\", concluding that it \"isn't a terrible film, just a terribly disappointing one.\" Cosmo Landesman believed, \"the humour seem[ed] to have lost its satirical bite and wit\" and that \"much of the comedy is structured around the idiocy of Homer\". This assessment was shared by Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times, who felt that \"once the movie wanders into its contemplation of mortality and meaning, the trenchancy kind of creaks and falls off.\" She negatively compared it to South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut (1999), a film similarly adapted from an animated television series, saying that, in terms of satire, it offers \"nothing we don't hear every night on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.\" Bruce Newman criticized the fleeting appearances of many of the show's secondary characters, and found the film to be \"a disappointment\"."

We're doing a lot of other stuff.\" In December 2014, just prior to the broadcast of the episode \"The Man Who Came to Be Dinner\", Jean wrote on Twitter that the episode (which had been produced in 2012 and was originally set to air in May 2013) had been held back by himself and Brooks because it was being considered for adaptation into a sequel film as the episode was \"cinematic\". Jean later expanded that there was the fear of the potential film being considered \"not canonical\" with the TV series and the potential backlash of overcoming it by using a \"memory wipe\". In July 2017, Silverman and Jean said that the sequel was in the early stages of development and stressed the toll production of the first picture took on the entire staff. On August 10, 2018, it was reported that a sequel is in development. On July 22, 2019, Groening stated that he has \"no doubts\" that Disney will likely produce a sequel one day. In July 2021, Jean stated that discussions for the potential sequel had stalled due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

        "content": "Corpse Bride (also known as Tim Burton's Corpse Bride) is a 2005 stop-motion animated musical dark fantasy film directed by Mike Johnson and Tim Burton with a screenplay by John August, Caroline Thompson and Pamela Pettler based on characters created by Burton and Carlos Grangel. The plot is set in a fictional Victorian era village in England. Johnny Depp leads the cast as the voice of Victor, while Helena Bonham Carter voices Emily, the titular bride. An international co-production between the United States and United Kingdom, Corpse Bride is the third stop-motion feature film produced by Burton and the first directed by him (the previous two films, The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach, were directed by Henry Selick). This is also the first stop-motion feature from Burton that was distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. It was dedicated to executive producer Joe Ranft, who died in a car crash during production. Corpse Bride premiered at the Venice International Film Festival on September 7, 2005 and was released on September 23, 2005 in United States and on October 13, 2005 in the United Kingdom. It became a critical and commercial success, grossing $118.1 million worldwide against its $40 million budget and received praise for its animation, characters, songs, and humor. Although the film won the National Board of Review for Best Animated Feature, the film was nominated for the 78th Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature, but lost to Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, which also starred Bonham Carter. The film won the Annie Awards Ub Iwerks Award for Technical Achievement in 2006, where it was also nominated for Best Animated Feature, Best Character Design, and Best Direction. It was shot with Canon EOS-1D Mark II digital SLRs, rather than the 35\u00a0mm film cameras used for Burton's previous stop-motion film The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)."

        "content": "In an unnamed Victorian town, Victor Van Dort, the son of nouveau riche fish merchants, and Victoria Everglot, the neglected and unloved daughter of impoverished aristocrats, prepare for their arranged marriage, which will simultaneously raise the social class of Victor's parents and restore the wealth of Victoria's family (\"According to Plan\"). Although they fall in love instantly, the nervous Victor ruins their wedding rehearsal by forgetting his vows and accidentally setting Lady Everglot's dress on fire. Fleeing to a nearby forest, he rehearses his vows with a tree and places his wedding ring on an upturned root. However, the root is revealed to be the finger of a dead woman named Emily, who rises from the grave claiming that she is now Victor's wife, and spirits him away to the Land of the Dead. During his time with her, Victor learns that Emily was murdered years ago on the night of her elopement by an unnamed perpetrator, and he stole the family jewels and bag of gold she had brought (\"Remains of the Day\"). Emily reunites Victor with his long-dead dog, Scraps, and they bond. Desperate to return to Victoria, Victor tricks Emily into returning them to the Land of the Living by claiming he wants her to meet his parents. Emily brings Victor to see Elder Gutknecht, the kindly ruler of the underworld, who grants them temporary passage. Victor, feeling guilty for tricking Emily, asks the bride to wait in the forest. He successfully reunites with Victoria and confesses his wish to marry her as soon as possible. Before the pair can share a kiss, Emily discovers them and, feeling betrayed and hurt, drags Victor back to the Land of the Dead (\"Tears to Shed\"). Victoria quickly tries to tell her parents of Victor's situation, but neither believes her and they assume he has left her. Against her will, Victoria's Everglot parents decide to marry her to a presumed-wealthy visitor named Lord Barkis Bittern, who appeared at the wedding rehearsal and explained to them that tragedy could have taken his original bride away from him. After reconciling with Emily, Victor learns of Victoria's impending marriage to Barkis from his family's newly deceased coachman. Upset over this news, Victor decides to marry Emily, learning that this will require him to repeat his wedding vows in the Land of the Living and drink a deadly poison in order to join her in death. The dead swiftly prepare for the ceremony and head \"upstairs\" (\"The Wedding Song\"), where the town erupts into a temporary panic upon their arrival until the townspeople recognizes their departed loved ones, and joyously reunite. The chaos causes a panicked and jealous Barkis to expose his own poor financial standing and his intentions to marry Victoria only for her supposed wealth, leading her to reject him. Victoria follows everyone to Victor and Emily's wedding as Victor completes his vows and prepares to drink the poison, only for Emily to stop him when she realizes she is denying Victoria her chance to live happily with him. Just as Emily reunites Victor and Victoria, Barkis arrives to kidnap Victoria. Emily recognizes him as her previous fianc\u00e9 and reveals he was also her murderer. Victor duels with Barkis to protect Victoria, and Emily intervenes to save Victor's life. Barkis mockingly toasts Emily for dying unwed and unwittingly drinks the poison that Victor nearly took, causing him to die and allowing the dead \u2013 who cannot interfere in the affairs of the living \u2013 to take retribution against him for his crimes. Emily, now freed from her torment, frees Victor of his vow to marry her and returns his ring, allowing him to marry Victoria, to whom she throws her wedding bouquet. As she steps into the moonlight, she fades away into hundreds of butterflies and flies into the sky, finding peace, as Victor and Victoria watch and embrace."

Co-director Mike Johnson spoke about how they took a more organic approach to directing the film, saying: \"In a co-directing situation, one director usually handles one sequence while the other handles another.

        "title": "Corpse Bride_Filming",
        "content": "The film was originally supposed to have been shot on film, though a last-minute change by the studio helped introduce a different technology. In 1997, during pre-production on Henry Selick's feature, Monkeybone, the film's cinematographer Pete Kozachik was looking for a type of filming that would streamline the process of integrating stop-motion characters with pre-filmed live actors. After finishing Monkeybone, Kozachik continued to test cameras for a practical means of shooting feature animation digitally. In early 2003, the production unit was not interested in digital capture for stop motion; the team was instead prepping the movie for a film shoot. Two weeks before filming was to begin, Kozachik and visual effects consultant Chris Watts came up with a solution using digital still cameras that was deemed viable by Warner Bros. senior vice president of physical production and visual effects Chris DeFaria. The production then became digital. After testing a dozen different models, Kozachik opted for a basic digital still camera, the Canon EOS-1D Mark II, an off-the-shelf model that was outfitted with adapters to allow the use of Nikon prime lenses (14mm-105mm). Kozachik spoke about why he chose the camera, saying: \"One reason I went with this particular camera is that its image chip is just about the same size as Super 35 film negative, so we could use Nikon lenses and treat them like regular 35mm cine lenses and get the same effect\u2014the same depth of field and angle of coverage. I knew that we were going to be fighting to make this look like a 'real' movie because we weren't shooting on film, so I wanted to at least have the optics look like movie optics.\" Animation took place at 3 Mills Studios in East London. A dozen animators/puppeteers were put to work when production began, but that number had tripled by the end of production. The initial group spent time developing each puppet's unique characteristics. The puppets themselves, built by Mackinnon and Saunders, were typically about 17 inches tall and animated on sets built three to four feet off the ground with trap doors that allowed animators access to the sets' surfaces to manipulate the puppets. The three primary characters\u2014Victor, Victoria and Corpse Bride\u2014were fitted with heads the size of golf balls that contained special gearing to allow the animators to manipulate individual parts of the puppets' faces. The animators' work was spread over 25 to 35 individual setups/stages, each having its own Canon digital camera. A total of 32 cameras were used on the film. Each camera was outfitted with a \"grabber\" system that enabled the animators to capture frames and download them into a computer to assemble a short \"reel\" of the shot being produced to check their work. The film's images were stored on a 1GB image card that was capable of holding approximately 100 frames of animation. Eight roving camera teams\u2014each team including a lighting cameraman, an assistant, a lighting electrician and a set dresser to deal with any art department issues\u2014worked with the animators to set up shots. Each camera team had a \"lighting station\" workstation\u2014comprising an Apple G4 computer and a monitor to assist in checking lighting and framing\u2014to view TIFF file versions of the camera's images. Once a shot was approved, the computer was removed and the animators were left to shoot the scene using their still camera and \"grabber\" computer/camera system to check their work. The film's story department head Jeffrey Lynch explained that the scenes were developed initially from storyboards created by a team, saying: \"We shot as close to a 1:1 film ratio [one take per shot] as we could because there was no time for reshoots. We did most of our experimentation in the storyboard process\u2014as many ways as needed\u2014to get the scene how we wanted it. There was no coverage, as there would be for a live-action film.\" Co-director Johnson would go over each scene with the animators, sometimes acting out the scene, if necessary. The animators would create a \"dope sheet\"\u2014in which a shot was broken down, frame by frame\u2014to account for key \"hits\". The animators would then shoot tests of the scene, often shooting on \"2s\" or \"4s\" (meaning shooting just every second or fourth frame of what would appear in the final animation). Johnson explained: \"The next day, when they'd finish their test/rehearsal, we'd cut it in and see how it played in the reel and fine-tune from there. We might do some lighting tweaks, performance tweaks or have the art department get in and touch anything that needed it. Then we'd close the curtain and let the animator animate the shot.\" The animators would sometimes make use of the voice and/or video recordings of the actors, a practice also common in cel animation. Once photographed, the frames were manipulated by a team of \"data wranglers.\" Using a workflow developed by Chris Watts, the frames were downloaded from the camera image cards as RAW files, converted to Cineon files and processed through a \"color cube.\" Cinematographer Pete Kozachik explained: \"The color cube is a 3D lookup table created by FilmLight Ltd. that forces the image data into behaving like a particular Eastman Kodak film stock\u2014in this case, 5248, one of my favorites. With this film emulation, we could actually rate our cameras at ASA 100, then take our light meters and spot meters and, with great confidence, shoot as if we were using 5248. Sure enough, the footage would come back and look just like it.\" The frames could be processed further to generate a TIFF file for viewing on the lighting station computer monitors so lighting, composition and color could be previewed."

        "content": "Visual effects were delivered by London's Moving Picture Company (MPC), and were applied to the 1,000 or so shots in the film, though most of the effects simply painted out puppet supports and similar set equipment. Some visual effects elements\u2014groups of birds and butterflies, were created completely in CG, though others were composited as visual effects from real-life elements. Pete Kozachik explained that the trick for shooting the characters by themselves was obtaining visually interesting shots that would dependably support the director's storytelling, saying: \"The challenge is keeping the action clear and simple with lighting and composition. There's a discipline to clear storytelling with these puppets. You want to be abstract, but one can easily go overboard with these critters because they aren't as familiar to the audience as real humans. The characters don't necessarily translate the same as if you're shooting a real person. You have to consciously balance arty atmosphere and graphic clarity so as to not confuse the audience about what it is they're looking at.\" In a 2005, interview with About.com, Burton spoke about the differences between directing  Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas, saying: \"The difference on that was that one I had designed completely. It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process.\" He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: \"It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so it might have been a little schizophrenic for him. But he\u2019s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that\u2019s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [together]. They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [Finney] and Joanna [Lumley] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That\u2019s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being in the same room with each other.\""

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.

In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Animation Films list.

Whatever the case, there is something heartening about Mr. Burton's love for bones and rot here, if only because it suggests, despite some recent evidence, that he is not yet ready to abandon his own dark kingdom.\" Moira MacDonald of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \"What makes Corpse Bride sing, ultimately, is the breadth of imagination that it demonstrates; creating a cluttered, textured and mysteriously beautiful world that we're loathe to leave at the end.\" Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"Ghoulishness and innocence walk hand-in-hand in Tim Burton's Corpse Bride, a movie that digs into Hollywood's past to resurrect the antique art of stop-motion animation and create a fabulous bauble of a movie.\" Jack Mathews of the New York Daily News gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \"Stop-motion animation may be the hardest and most tedious job in Hollywood, but the makers of Tim Burton's Corpse Bride deserve a couple of years in Tahiti celebrating their effort.\" Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \"Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is an instant classic.\" Lisa Rose of the Newark Star-Ledger gave the film three out of five stars, saying \"Corpse Bride offers unclassifiable enchantment.\" James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"As animated films go, this is easily the best of a weak year.\" Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film four out of four stars, saying \"If his The Nightmare Before Christmas from a dozen years back was a treat for the eyes and mind, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride goes double or nothing by being a delight for the ears and also the heart.\" Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch gave the film a B+, saying \"Beneath the bone pile of allusions, Corpse Bride is a darkly enchanting fable in its own right.\" Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer gave the film a negative review, saying \"Corpse Bride turns out to be a ponderous mixture of puppetry and animation that is far too technologically complex and laborious for this hopelessly Luddite reviewer.\" Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, calling it \"A sweet and visually lovely tale of love lost.\" Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film four out of five stars, saying \"The sweetness, the visual flourishes and inspired pieces of casting carry the Corpse Bride, if not all the way down the primrose path, then at least across the threshold.\" Robert K.

Although new to the area, they are able to find pupils with the assistance of the wealthy Amelia Tilford, who enrolls her malevolent granddaughter Mary and encourages other families to enroll their daughters. Shortly before the school opens, Martha's aunt, Lily Mortar, arrives and forces her way into a teaching position as a way to continue sponging off of Martha. Karen and local doctor Joe Cardin begin to date, unaware that Martha is in love with him. One evening, Joe falls asleep in a chair in Martha's room while waiting for Karen to return to the school. He wakes with a start and breaks a glass, which wakes up Mary Tilford. Before he leaves, he casually refers to his and Karen's plans to marry, and Mary watches from the shadows as Martha sobs quietly once she thinks she is alone. When Karen punishes Mary for missing classes and lying, Mary acts as though she has a pain and falls to the floor in a faint. Although they are not convinced by Mary's performance, Karen and Martha call Joe to examine her. While Joe and Karen are busy with Mary, Martha decides to finally fire Aunt Lily, who is not a good teacher. Lily feels slighted, even though Martha offers to continue to support her, and they have an argument before she goes, during which Lily confronts Martha with her suspicions about the young woman's true feelings for Joe. Martha hears a noise and discovers Rosalie Wells and Evelyn Munn, who are Mary's roommates, listening at the door. Flustered, she accidentally closes the door on Rosalie's arm, slightly injuring her. Back in their room, Evelyn tells Mary about the argument between Martha and Lily. Feeling persecuted, Mary decides to run away from the school. When her grandmother Amelia just wants to send her back, she tells Amelia a grossly distorted version both of what she witnessed between Martha and Joe and of the argument between Martha and Lily, suggesting Martha and Joe engaged in an illicit sexual affair. To verify the story, Mary has Amelia talk to Rosalie, who she has brought with her and coerced by threatening to reveal that Rosalie stole another student's bracelet. Mary even says that Martha injured Rosalie's arm intentionally. Amelia is shocked by the revelation of a love triangle between Karen, Joe, and Martha, and alerts the other parents who have girls at the school, all of whom withdraw their daughters. The trio sue Amelia for slander, but they lose their case. Karen and Martha are unable to enroll any new students, and Joe is fired from his job at the hospital. Lily returns, but Martha resents her for not coming back to testify during the case and tells her to leave. Joe asks Karen to come with him to Vienna, where he has gotten a job. She balks when he mentions that Martha is also invited and finally asks if there was ever anything between Martha and him. Unable to fully believe his denial after what she heard in court, she tells him to go to Vienna by himself. Once Joe is gone, Martha admits to Karen that she loves Joe, though she says she never told him, and then gets on the same train as Lily. In passing, Lily mentions having seen Mary and Rosalie with the missing bracelet, and Martha realizes what happened. She gets off the train and convinces Rosalie to tell Amelia the truth. Amelia offers Martha compensation, but Martha refuses, asking only that Amelia take Karen a message from her: \"stay with Joe, wherever he is.\" Martha leaves, Amelia talks to Karen, and Karen goes to Vienna to be with Joe."

        "content": "Lillian Hellman's 1934 play The Children's Hour was inspired by the true story of two Scottish school teachers whose lives were destroyed in 1810 when they were falsely accused by one of their students of engaging in a lesbian relationship. At the time, the mention of homosexuality on stage was illegal in New York State, but authorities chose to overlook the play's subject matter when its Broadway production was acclaimed by critics. Because the Hays Code, which was in effect when the film was produced, would never permit a film to focus on or even hint at lesbianism, Samuel Goldwyn was the only producer interested in purchasing the film rights to the play. He signed Hellman to adapt her play for the screen, and the playwright changed the lie from being that the two school teachers were lovers to it being that one of the teachers had slept with the other's fianc\u00e9. The Hays Office even prevented the use of or a reference to the play's original title, so Hellman also changed the title of her script to The Lie; it was not until after principal photography was completed that the film was rechristened These Three. Goldwyn had already cast the three leads when he offered William Wyler, who, until then, had helmed mostly B pictures and Westerns, the opportunity to direct the film, along with a five-year contract. Although Wyler wasn't completely happy with Goldwyn's casting choices, he accepted the offer, though he insisted on a three-year contract instead. He tried to convince Goldwyn to replace contract player Joel McCrea with Leslie Howard, but the producer refused and, unwisely, told McCrea about Wyler's preference, which led to difficulties between the actor and director during filming. The Lux Radio Theatre aired a one-hour adaptation of the film on December 6, 1937, with Barbara Stanwyck as Martha Dobie, Errol Flynn as Dr. Joe Cardin, Mary Astor as Karen Wright, and Constance Collier as Lily Mortar. Alma Kruger and Marcia Mae Jones reprised their roles from the film as Amelia Tilford and Rosalie Wells, respectively."

        "content": "Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times wrote: \"Miss Hellman's job of literary carpentry is little short of brilliant. Upon the framework of her stage success she has constructed an absorbing, tautly written and dramatically vital screen play. To it, in turn, a gifted cast headed by Merle Oberon, Miriam Hopkins and Joel McCrea has contributed lavishly of its talents, aided by superb direction and exceptionally fine photography. In its totality the picture emerges as one of the finest screen dramas in recent years . . . Strong, turbulent and caustic, These Three is an unusual picture and it has been brought to the screen with perception, beauty and a keen sense of drama.\" The review in Variety said of Bonita Granville and Marcia Mae Jones: \"Theirs are inspired performances.\" It added: \"Hellman, if anything, has improved upon the original in scripting the triangle as a dramatis personae of romantic frustration, three basically wholesome victims of an unwholesome combination of circumstance. McCrea was never better in translating a difficult assignment intelligently and sympathetically. The well bred restraint of Hopkins and Oberon in their travail with the mixture of juvenile emotions at their boarding school is likewise impressive.\" Writing for The Spectator in 1936, Graham Greene observed: \"I have seldom been so moved by any fictional film . . . After ten minutes or so of the usual screen sentiment, quaintness and exaggeration, one began to watch the incredulous pleasure of nothing less than life.\" Greene praised the acting of the protagonists portrayed by Oberon, Hopkins, and, to a lesser extent, McCrea, as well as the \"shocking mastery\" of the performances by Granville and Jones as the antagonists. The review in Film Daily read, in part: \"Tense, dramatic, this is one of the most powerful pictures that has come to the talking screen . . . Miriam Hopkins and Merle Oberon give splendid performances, but it is the work of little Bonita Granville, as the troublemaker, which will attract the most attention.\" John Mosher of The New Yorker wrote that \"quite a good piece of work has been done with this somewhat problematic drama\". He added: \"With all the drastic alterations made in the plot, it is surprising how many of the original episodes and scenes have been retained.\" In the 21st century, TVGuide.com rated the film 4\u00bd out of five stars, calling it \"gripping, adult cinema\" and commenting that \"Oberon gives one of her best dramatic performances and McCrea is also quite fine. The two child actresses have the showiest parts, but the real performances to watch are those of Alma Kruger and Miriam Hopkins. Hopkins, in particular, has rarely been better, her intense, high-strung quality perfectly suited to the role of a woman unable to stop her world from falling apart around her.\""

        "content": "The Rugrats Movie is a 1998 American animated musical comedy film based on the Nickelodeon animated television series Rugrats. It was directed by Igor Kovalyov and Norton Virgien and was written by David N. Weiss & J. David Stem. The film introduced Tommy Pickles' baby brother Dil Pickles, who appeared on the series the next year. The film features the voices of E. G. Daily, Tara Strong, Christine Cavanaugh, Kath Soucie, Cheryl Chase, Cree Summer, and Charlie Adler, along with guest stars David Spade, Whoopi Goldberg, Margaret Cho, Busta Rhymes, and Tim Curry. The events of the film take place between the series' fifth and sixth seasons. Plans for a Rugrats film adaptation, along with Ren and Stimpy and Doug, began when Nickelodeon made a contract with 20th Century Fox to produce films between 1993 and 1995. However, the contract expired with no films into production. Around the same year when the contract expired, development of the film restarted with Paramount Pictures since Nickelodeon's parent company, Viacom, purchased the studio in 1994 and production had restarted on the television series after a small hiatus. The Rugrats Movie was released by Paramount Pictures in the United States on November 20, 1998. The film opened at #1 in the United States and grossed $141 million worldwide. It became the first non-Disney animated film to gross over $100 million in the United States. The film is followed by two sequels: Rugrats in Paris: The Movie in 2000 and Rugrats Go Wild in 2003."

The baby comes unexpectedly early and, despite being told it will be a girl, Didi delivers a boy. She and her husband Stu name him Dil and quickly find themselves struggling to cope with his constant outbursts. Tommy finds Dil hard to get on with but accepts the responsibility of being an older brother after a conversation with Stu, who assures him that one day he will be happy to have Dil as his younger brother. Elsewhere, a circus train is hijacked by the monkeys on board, who crash it in the woods. Stu finishes building the Reptar Wagon for a toy contest in Japan, which Phil and Lil suggest using to take Dil back to the hospital. As Tommy and Chuckie object, the car drives away with the babies on board. They speed recklessly through the streets and eventually crash in the woods, where they realize that they are lost. At first Angelica shows no concern until she realizes the babies have her Cynthia doll, which prompts her to take the family dog, Spike, to find them and retrieve Cynthia. The babies set off for a ranger's cabin in the woods where they believe a magic \"lizard\" (a mispronunciation of wizard) lives and can grant their wish to go home. On the way they encounter the circus monkeys, who take Dil with them. When his friends refuse to go after Dil, believing they are better off without him, Tommy sets off to rescue his brother alone. Meanwhile the parents soon find out that the babies are missing and set out to find them in the face of the media sensation that has suddenly generated around their children's disappearance. Tommy eventually finds Dil during a storm, but as he tries to take care of him Dil again acts selfishly. Tommy finally snaps and prepares to give Dil back to the monkeys, but Tommy's rage scares Dil into ending his behavior. At the same time, Dil's remorseful tears cause Tommy to come to his senses and the brothers reconcile. After the storm, they are found by Phil, Lil, Chuckie, Angelica and Spike, and they all continue their way to finally reach \"the lizard\". On the bridge to the ranger's station, the babies are confronted by the monkeys, who are then scared off by a huge wolf who has been tailing the babies since they arrived in the woods. Spike saves the babies by fighting the wolf and then dragging it off the bridge, saddening them when it appears Spike is gone. Stu, who has been looking for the babies in a pterodactyl-like glider, sees them from above and crash lands into the ranger's cabin. Believing he is the \"lizard,\" the babies ask him to bring Spike back instead of going home. Stu falls through the bridge and reveals Spike, who survived the fall by landing on a plank of the bridge. The children are reunited with their parents and accept Dil as one of the group."

        "content": "Talks about making Rugrats into a feature film existed since the beginning of the series. The first attempt was in 1993, when Nickelodeon made a two-year contract deal with 20th Century Fox to produce new material, but an unnamed Nickelodeon executive did not rule out the possibility to make films based on their existing properties, one of those that was proposed was Rugrats, alongside Doug and The Ren & Stimpy Show. However, in 1994, Nickelodeon's parent company Viacom acquired Paramount Pictures, and Paramount would distribute the films instead. As a result, the contract from Fox expired, with no films produced (although Doug would eventually get a theatrical film from Walt Disney Pictures in 1999). Production on The Rugrats Movie started a year later in 1995. Two months before the release of the movie, an episode prequel titled \"The Family Tree\" was aired as the final episode of the fifth season. The film's beginning and ending parody Paramount and Lucasfilm's Indiana Jones film series. This later inspired the second segment of the episode \"A Tale of Two Puppies / Okey-Dokey Jones and the Ring of the Sunbeams\", that aired during the show's eighth season in 2002. This film was the first Rugrats media to use digital ink and paint, rather than the traditional cel animation used in the show. Two songs were cut from the film during production. The first revolves around Stu and Didi in a nightmare sequence where Dr. Lipschitz criticizes their parenting through a song. The second depicts the Rugrats pushing the Reptar Wagon through the woods, debating what to do about Dil in an army chant style song. These two scenes were cut from the theatrical, VHS,  DVD, and Laserdisc releases. However, these scenes are shown on CBS and Nickelodeon television airings of the film. These scenes were also present in the print novelization. The film was released in theaters with a CatDog short titled \"Fetch\". This short was later broadcast in CatDog Episode 21. However, the VHS, DVD and Laserdisc release contains a different CatDog short from Episode 28 titled \"Winslow's Home Videos\"."

Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four. Ebert wrote that the film's target audience was primarily younger children, and that, while he as an adult disliked it, he \"might have\" liked it if he were younger and would recommend it for children. The New York Timess Anita Gates reviewed The Rugrats Movie positively, calling it a \"delight\". Neil Jeffries of Empire gave the film three out of five stars, saying, \"Fun for kids, but, despite some adult references, appeal for the over 10s is limited.\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly graded the film with a B. Schwarzbaum praised the movie for its appeal to both adult and child audiences, \"juxtaposing the blithely self-absorbed parallel universes of small, diapered children and their large, Dockered parents\". However, other Entertainment Weekly reviewer Ty Burr gave The Rugrats Movie a B\u2212, criticizing that the film's issues sprung from it being \"bigger\" than the original series, thus it having more cultural references, out-of-place CGI scenes, and \"[going] into scary territory\". Burr did praise the \"escaped circus monkeys\" for being \"scary in a good way\", as well as a joke that was accessible to younger audiences.Rugrats co-creator Paul Germain (who was showrunner for the first three seasons before leaving to work for Disney Television Animation) disliked the film's story. Germain felt that the writers of the movie did not understand what the series was about, and thought that moments such as Stu giving a watch to Tommy did not work as the adults were not supposed to recognize the babies' intelligence. In addition, he felt that by giving Tommy a baby brother, Tommy was no longer the baby, which changed the story of the series from what Germain intended it to be."

However, before Homer finishes the donut, he realizes that Ned will not be able to have his soul if he does not eat all of the donut and keeps the final piece in the refrigerator.

At the stroke of twelve midnight, Ned brings Homer back to the Simpson household for his trial. Then, when the Simpsons' lawyer, Lionel Hutz, flees after ruining his case, Marge makes a final effort to save Homer by displaying a photo from their wedding day. On the back of the photo, Homer has written that, in return for Marge giving him her hand in marriage, he pledges his soul to her forever; therefore, it was not his property to sell at the time of his deal with Ned. The jury rules in favor of the Simpsons and the presiding judge dismisses the case. Defeated and enraged, Ned frees Homer, but gets his revenge by turning Homer's head into a donut.

The family is invited to Mr. Burns' castle in Pennsylvania for a midnight feast, where Bart and Lisa discover a secret staircase descending to an eerie basement filled with coffins. As they investigate, vampires emerge from the coffins and encircle them while Lisa reads through Mr. Burns autobiography \"Yes, I Am a Vampire\" (with a foreword by Steve Allen). Lisa escapes, but Bart activates the \"Super Fun Happy Slide\", causing him to slide back down into the vampire pit, whereupon he is captured and bitten by Mr. Burns. Lisa tries to warn her parents, but Burns reappears with Bart who is now very pale and is behaving oddly. But these factors get little attention by the family. Later that night, Lisa is awakened by a now undead Bart and his vampire friends. When Bart is about to bite Lisa, Homer and Marge interrupt and discover that Bart is a vampire. Lisa claims that the only way to restore him is to kill the head vampire, Mr. Burns. The family returns to Mr. Burns' mansion, where Homer drives a stake through Mr. Burns' heart (after first hitting his crotch), causing him to dissolve into sand (but not before Mr. Burns tells Homer \"You're Fired!\"). The next morning, however, Lisa discovers that everyone else in the Simpson family is a vampire, with Marge as their head. The family closes in on Lisa, but instead of attacking, they break character and wish the home audience a happy Halloween.

        "content": "\"Treehouse of Horror IV\" was directed by David Silverman and co-written by Conan O'Brien (his final assignment for The Simpsons; by the time this episode aired, his brand-new late night show on NBC had been on for a little over a month), Bill Oakley, Josh Weinstein, Greg Daniels, Dan McGrath, and Bill Canterbury. It is the fourth episode of the annual Treehouse of Horror Halloween specials. As with the rest of the Halloween specials, the episode is considered non-canon and falls outside the show's regular continuity. O'Brien worked on the \"wrap-arounds\" of Bart introducing each segment to make sure that they \"pulled\" the episode together. The wrap-arounds are based on Rod Serling's television series Night Gallery, in which Serling appears at an art gallery and introduces each episode by unveiling paintings depicting the stories. Executive producer James L. Brooks loved the show, so it was \"great fun\" for him to do the parody. Show runner David Mirkin thought the Treehouse of Horror episodes were the hardest episodes to do because the staff had to fit in all three stories in only 22 minutes. Mirkin said, \"Things had to happen really fast. They're really just crammed with jokes and story beats and everything.\" The first segment, \"The Devil and Homer Simpson\", was written by Daniels and McGrath. The first time Devil Flanders appears, he looks the same as the devil Chernabog from the 1940 Walt Disney produced film Fantasia; Silverman particularly admired the animation in that sequence. Oakley loved the idea of Flanders being the Devil because he was the character whom viewers would least expect. He also thought Harry Shearer did a good job of playing Flanders in a much darker way, while remaining very true to the character. Many scenes had to be cut to shorten the segment, including one that showed Homer's severed head being used as a bowling ball by a demon in hell. This scene later appeared in the clip show episode \"The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\", which aired in the show's seventh season. The second segment, \"Terror at  Feet\", was written by Oakley and Weinstein. It was inspired by an episode of The Twilight Zone called \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\", in which William Shatner's character is inside an airplane watching a gremlin tear apart the wing. Silverman watched the episode to get inspiration for Bart's facial expressions. Oakley said there was a lot of work put into the design of the gremlin in \"Terror at  Feet\" to make him scary \"within The Simpsons universe\". Mirkin said he felt the gremlin was well-done because he looked scary and \"yet it looks like a completely organic Simpsons character\". \u00dcter, a character from Germany, makes his first appearance on the show in this segment; he was conceived as a one-time joke, but reappeared in later episodes because Mirkin felt he was \"such a perfect stereotype\". The third segment, \"Bart Simpson's Dracula\", was written by Canterbury. It is based on Francis Ford Coppola's film Bram Stoker's Dracula. Mirkin was a big fan of the film and pushed for a segment about vampires inspired by the movie. He liked the final result and felt Mr. Burns was perfect in the role of Dracula. Dracula and his castle were designed by Silverman. Mirkin, a \"big\" Peanuts fan, came up with the idea for the ending of \"Bart Simpson's Dracula\"."

        "content": "The wrap-around segments are a reference to Rod Serling's television series Night Gallery. The paintings seen in these segments are parodies of well-known works, including The Scream, The Son of Man, The Death of Marat, The Persistence of Memory, and Ascending and Descending, all featuring members of the Simpson family. \"Terror at  Feet\" is a parody of the final segment seen in Twilight Zone: The Movie and The Twilight Zone episode \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\". The title and a majority of the plot of \"Bart Simpson's Dracula\" is a parody of the Francis Ford Coppola film Bram Stoker's Dracula. The ending of \"Bart Simpson's Dracula\" is a reference to A Charlie Brown Christmas. The demon who is feeding Homer donuts says: \"I don't understand it. James Coco went mad in fifteen minutes!\", referencing an actor who received attention for his culinary talents and best-selling cookbooks. The jury at Homer's trial consists of John Wilkes Booth, Lizzie Borden, John Dillinger, Blackbeard, Benedict Arnold, the starting lineup of the 1976 Philadelphia Flyers, and Richard Nixon (who points out that's he's not yet dead). The first time the Devil appears, he resembles the demon Chernabog from the Walt Disney film Fantasia, especially after Homer discovers a technicality and starts taunting the Devil that he's \"smarter than the devil\", until the Devil turns into the Chernabog-esque demon and glares at him before disappearing. The scene in Hell where Homer is fed all the doughnuts in the world, and asks for more, is a direct parody of the cartoon Pigs is Pigs, in which the character Piggy (known for being a glutton) is taken in by a scientist and forced to eat all the food in the world. At Mr. Burns' castle, Lisa notices a tome resting on a stand in the basement. She runs over and reads the title: \"Yes, I Am a Vampire, by Monty Burns. Foreword by Steve Allen,\" a reference to American actor Steve Allen. Shortly after she finds the tome, she makes allusions to Shemp and Curly Howard of the Three Stooges, mistaking Bart's fearful attempts at getting her attention as impressions of the two. Bart floating outside Lisa's bedroom window is a parody of The Lost Boys as well as Stephen King's novel Salem's Lot. The family's plan to kill the head vampire is also a reference to both the film and novel. In particular, the twist revelation that Burns is not the head vampire is also a reference to the twist ending of The Lost Boys. The closing credits of the episode features a version of the Simpsons theme that is a combination of the instruments used in The Munsters theme song and the harpsichord and clicking from The Addams Family theme song."

The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said the episode included many notable sequences and was \"probably the best\" Treehouse of Horror episode. They particularly liked the scenes in Hell where Homer is punished by the Devil, and Chief Wiggum's attempts to deal with Dracula (who he thinks is a mummy) in the \"Bart Simpson's Dracula\" segment by ordering the Egyptian wing of the Springfield museum to be destroyed. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson thought \"Terror at  Feet\" was the best segment of the episode. Jacobson praised \"The Devil and Homer Simpson\" as clever funny, and described \"Bart Simpson's Dracula\" as \"easily the least effective\", claiming it, \"presents some good moments but never quite takes flight\". Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode an A grade and called it \"one of the very best\" Halloween specials, although said \"Treehouse of Horror V\" was better. Central Michigan Lifes John Thorpe named it the tenth best episode of the series, and wrote: \"The best part comes when Homer decides not to eat the last part of the doughnut, thus saving him from hell. Hilarious.\" DVD Talk's Bill Gibron gave the episode a 4 out of 5 score. Kim Nowacki of Yakima Herald-Republic named \"Treehouse of Horror IV\" her \"all-time favorite\" episode. She praised the parodies of The Twilight Zone and A Charlie Brown Christmas. The episode's reference to Bram Stoker's Dracula was named the 32nd greatest film reference in the history of the show by Total Film's Nathan Ditum. James Whitbrook of Gizmodo called \"Bart Simpson's Dracula\" the \"best sketch in what is the best Treehouse of Horror.\""

With only six weeks to the airdate, the writers made almost one hundred line changes, a very rare occurrence. It was decided to completely overhaul the episode after a poorly received screening with the writing staff. The tombstones that appeared at the start of and during the episode were abandoned in later episodes because it was becoming increasingly difficult to think of ideas. A subtle tombstone joke in this episode is in the scene where two zombies are crawling out of their graves. The names Jay Kogen and Wolodarsky (two of The Simpsons writers who worked on the episode) are written on the tombstones, but both are misspelled. The \"King Homer\" segment is one of Matt Groening's all-time favorite stories from the Treehouse of Horror series. Al Jean was also quite worried about this segment because it was the longest running black-and-white segment they had ever aired, and he thought that some people might be concerned that their televisions were broken. The \"He was a zombie?\" line, created by Mike Reiss, is, in the opinions of the writers, one of the all-time classic lines from the series."

It was meant to show Homer's stomach bigger than that of the outline, but it was so subtle that not many people realised the joke. In the episode's wraparounds, Bart is dressed as Alex from the film A Clockwork Orange. The \"Clown Without Pity\" segment is based on the Twilight Zone episode \"Living Doll\" and the film Trilogy of Terror. The title itself is a play on the song \"Town Without Pity\", written for the movie of the same name and performed by Gene Pitney. The man that gives Homer the Krusty doll is based on Mr. Wing from the film Gremlins. The song Homer sings in the bathtub is a variation of the Oscar Meyer song with the letters spelling out his name instead of \"O-S-C-A-R\".  The Krusty doll riding under Homer's car is a reference to the 1991 film Cape Fear. The song Marge hears while put on hold after calling the Krusty doll hotline is \"Everybody Loves a Clown\" by Gary Lewis & the Playboys. The \"King Homer\" segment is a parody of the 1933 film King Kong. In \"King Homer\", the tribal leader is heard saying 'Mosi Tatupu, Mosi Tatupu', which means they will sacrifice the blue-haired lady. The title \"Dial \"Z\" for Zombies\" is a play on the title of the 1954 Hitchcock film Dial M for Murder. Some aspects of \"Dial \"Z\" for Zombies\" are from the film Return of the Living Dead. In the pet cemetery, there are tombstones that read Fish Police, Capitol Critters and Family Dog, each a short-lived animated series intended to capitalize on The Simpsons success.

The Blue Angel presents the tragic transformation of a respectable professor to a cabaret clown and his descent into madness. The film is the first feature-length German full-talkie and brought Dietrich international fame. In addition, it introduced her signature song, Friedrich Hollaender and Robert Liebmann's \"Falling in Love Again (Can't Help It)\". It is considered to be a classic of German cinema. The film was shot simultaneously in German- and English-language versions, although the latter version was thought lost for many years.

Fortunately for Sternberg, Paramount's sister studio in Germany, UFA, offered him the opportunity to direct Emil Jannings in his first sound film. Jannings was the Oscar-winning star of Sternberg's 1928 movie The Last Command, and had specially requested Sternberg's participation, despite an \"early clash of temperaments\" on the set.Baxter, 1971. p. 63 Though The Blue Angel and Morocco, both from 1930, are often cited as his first sound films, Sternberg had already directed \"a startling experiment\" in asynchronous sound techniques with his 1929 Thunderbolt."

        "content": "Singer Lucie Mannheim was favored by UFA producer Erich Pommer for the part of Lola, with support from leading man Emil Jannings, but Sternberg vetoed her as insufficiently glamorous for a major production.  Sternberg also turned down author Mann's actress-girlfriend Trude Hesterberg. Brigitte Helm, seriously considered by Sternberg, was not available for the part. Sternberg and Pommer settled on stage and film actress K\u00e4the Haack for the amount of 25,000 Reichsmarks. Biographer Herman G. Weinberg, citing Sternberg's memoirs (1966) reports that the director had his first look at the 29-year-old Marie Magdalene \"Marlene\" Dietrich at a music revue named the Zwei Krawatten (Two Neckties), produced by dramatist Georg Kaiser. Sternberg began immediately to groom Dietrich into \"the woman he saw she could become\". Critic Andrew Sarris remarks on the irony of this singular director-actress relationship: \"Josef von Sternberg is too often subordinated to the mystique of Marlene Dietrich...the Svengali-Trilby publicity that enshrouded The Blue Angel \u2013 and the other six Sternberg-Dietrich film collaborations \u2013 obscured the more meaningful merits not only of these particular works but of Sternberg's career as a whole.\""

        "content": "After arriving at Berlin's UFA studios, Sternberg declined an offer to direct a film about Rasputin, the former Russian spiritual advisor to the family of Czar Nicholas II. He was intrigued, however, by a story from socialist reformer Heinrich Mann entitled Professor Unrat (Professor Filth) (1905), which critiques \"the false morality and corrupt values of the German middle class\" and agreed to adapt it.Baxter, 1971. p. 63, p. 66 The narrative of Mann's story was largely abandoned by Sternberg (with the author's consent), retaining only scenes describing an affair between a college professor of high rectitude who becomes infatuated with a promiscuous cabaret singer. During the filming, Sternberg altered dialog, added scenes and modified cast characterizations that \"gave the script an entirely new dimension.\"Weinberg, 1967. p. 50 The Professor's descent from sexual infatuation to jealous rage and insanity was entirely the director's invention.Weinberg, 1967. P.50 In order to maximize the film's profitability, The Blue Angel was filmed in both German and English, each shot in tandem for efficiency. The shooting spanned 11-weeks, from Novernber 4, 1929 to 22 January 1930 at an estimated budget of $500,000, remarkably high for a UFA production of that period.Baxter, 1971. p. 63, 67 pp. 74\u201375 During filming, although he was still the nominal star of the film (with top billing), Jannings could see the growing closeness between Sternberg and Dietrich and the care the director took in presenting her, and the actor became jealous, engaging in histrionics and threatening to quit the production. The Blue Angel was to be his last great cinematic moment; it was also one of UFA's last successful films.Baxter, 1971. p. 63, pp. 74\u201375: The Blue Angel \"had no successors at UFA\" Film historian Andrew Sarris comments on this double irony: ReleaseThe Blue Angel was scheduled for its Berlin premiere on 1 April 1930, but UFA owner and industrialist Alfred Hugenberg, unhappy with socialist Heinrich Mann's association with the production, blocked release. Production manager Pommer defended the film, and Mann issued a statement distancing his anti-bourgeois critique from Sternberg's more sympathetic portrayal of Professor Immanuel Rath in his movie version. Sternberg, who declared himself apolitical, had departed the country in February, shortly after the film was completed and the internecine conflict emerged. Hugenberg ultimately relented on the grounds of financial expediency, still convinced that Sternberg had concealed within The Blue Angel \"a parody of the German bourgeoisie.\"Weinberg, 1967. p. 54: \"Hugenberg [a political reactionary] had sensed that, within the framework of an entertainment film, Sternberg had subtly mirrored the paranoiac tendencies of the Prussian bourgeoisie.\" The film proved to be \"an instant international success.\"Weinberg, 1967. p. 54 Dietrich, at Sternberg's insistence, was brought to Hollywood under contract to Paramount, where they would film and release Morocco in 1930 before The Blue Angel would appear in American theatres in 1931. Themes and analysisThe Blue Angel, ostensibly a story of the downfall of a respectable middle-age academic at the hands of a pretty young cabaret singer, is Sternberg's \"most brutal and least humorous\" film of his \u0153uvre.Sarris, 1998. p. 121: \"The Blue Angel (1930) [depicts] the downfall of a middle-aged bourgeois male through the machinations of a disreputable demi-mondaine...\" The harshness of the narrative \"transcends the trivial genre of bourgeois male corrupted by bohemian female\" and the complexity of Sternberg's character development rejects \"the old stereotype of the seductress\" who ruthlessly cuckolds her men. Film historian Andrew Sarris outlines Sternberg's \"complex interplay\" between Lola and the Professor: Biographer John Baxter echoes this the key thematic sequence that reveals \"the tragic dignity\" of Rath's downfall: When Rath, in a jealous rage, enters the room where his wife, Lola, is making love to the cabaret strongman, Mazeppa, Sternberg declines to show us Rath \u2013 now a madman \u2013 at the moment he is violently subdued by the authorities and placed in a straitjacket. Sternberg rewards the degraded Professor Rath for having \"achieved a moment of masculine beauty [by] crowing like a maddened rooster\" at Lola's deception: \"Sternberg will not cheapen that moment by degrading a man who has been defeated.\" Sternberg presents \"the spectacle of a prudent, prudish man blocked off from all means of displaying his manhood except the most animalistic.\" The loss of Lola leaves Rath with but one alternative: death.Sarris, 1998. p. 221: \"Sternberg's profundity...is measured less by the breadth of this vision than by the perfection of his form and by the emotional force of his characters within that form.\" Remakes, adaptations, and parodiesThe Blue Angel (1959). Director Edward Dmytryk's remake; with Curd J\u00fcrgensPousse-Cafe, a 1966 Broadway musical version with music by Duke Ellington. It was unsuccessful and closed after three performances.

He also dreams of poisoning as many people as he can. In his teen years, he poisons a schoolmate\u2014making him ill rather than killing him\u2014in order to date a girl his schoolmate was seeing. His conversation with his date involves vivid, graphic descriptions of deadly car accidents. He also reads a comic book account of an event in which the Dutch Resistance killed a whole German army camp in the occupied Netherlands during the Second World War by poisoning their water supply with thallium. Graham is arrested at the age of 14 outside his home in Neasden after poisoning his father and stepmother with thallium, killing his stepmother and leaving his father seriously ill. During the struggle with police, he drops his \"Exit Dose\" of thallium, which he intended to use to commit suicide should he be caught. He is hospitalised for nine years in an institution for the criminally insane, during which time a psychiatrist works with him in the hopes of rehabilitating him. Graham's dishonesty becomes evident to the doctor, who can see that Graham is trying to deceive him. Graham apparently has no dreams to share with the psychiatrist so he \"borrows\" a fellow prisoner's dreams. This source is shut off to him, however, once the fellow prisoner commits suicide. Despite the initial evidence of Graham's deceitfulness, the doctor eventually gets him released. Graham then goes to work in a camera factory and is shown the secret ingredient used in the company's shutter system\u2014thallium. It is not long before Graham starts poisoning people again. He kills two of his workmates by poisoning their tea with thallium stolen from the laboratory, and makes many others ill. For months, the source of the \"bug\" afflicting the workers at the factory remains a mystery until one unforeseen event leads to Graham's being found out. As a hygiene measure, all the personalised teacups are replaced with uniform ones, leaving Graham unable to poison people selectively. His efforts to memorise which cup is going to which person give him away and his workmates finally realise what is going on. Graham is arrested soon afterwards and he is later sentenced to a lengthy custodial term, this time in an ordinary prison. He commits suicide by poisoning himself with the \"Newton's Diamond\" he made in the psychiatric hospital."

Returning home in a dense fog, Kit is startled by an unseen eerie male voice that threatens to kill her. The following day, Tony's assistant, Daniel Graham (Richard Ney), notifies Tony that he's been looking at the books of Tony's company, and it appears a large sum of money has been embezzled from their firm. Kit begins receiving phone calls from the same threatening voice. Tony and Kit report the incidents to Scotland Yard, but Inspector Byrnes (John Williams) dismissively attributes the case to Kit's imaginative way of getting her husband's attention. Kit's Aunt Bea (Myrna Loy) arrives for a visit and upon seeing Kit's nervousness, Bea becomes concerned for Kit's well-being. After several more incidents, Tony and Bea insist that Kit see a psychiatrist. The voice finally announces he is coming to kill Kit. Tony pretends to leave to lure in the stalker, but shortly returns. A gunman enters and takes a bullet in the ensuing struggle with Tony. The voice, however, is still heard coming from a tape recorder. Tony now turns on Kit and confesses he has been gaslighting Kit with help from his lover, their neighbor Peggy (Natasha Parry), in a scheme to kill her for the money to cover up his embezzlement. Terrified for her life, Kit runs through the balcony high onto the construction site and is rescued by the construction foreman, Brian Younger (John Gavin). Tony is arrested by Byrnes, who had tapped the Prestons' phone and realized that Kit's fear was real and that Tony was the mastermind."

This is to be embellished by highly dramatic lighting effects and striking hues, principally in the warmer yellow-brown range of the spectrum.

Her younger sister, Lea (May) is hired on the recommendation of Christine. The two sisters become increasingly alienated from their employer, separated by barriers between the classes. The employer and her daughter look down on the sisters for the most trivial things, and it soon becomes the norm for the two pairs of women to not even speak directly to each other. With only each other to turn to, the relationship becomes sexual, adding to the tension between the sisters and their employer. Both of them deal with trauma brought on by strained relationships with their mother and others of the church. Over time, there are continual rumors of the employer\u2019s daughter getting married and moving out. Christine becomes paranoid and jealous that Lea will go with her when that day comes, and she\u2019ll be left nothing, but Lea assures her this isn\u2019t the case. Christine fears she is a monster like her mother. One day, the iron blows a fuse and burns the daughter\u2019s blouse Lea was preparing. Short on money and time, the sisters resign to their fate; when their employer and her daughter angrily return from a shopping trip, Christine tries to explain what happened. The employer claims she knows what she\u2019s done with her sister and they\u2019ll never work again once word gets out.  The sisters fly into a rage and brutally murder the employer and her daughter. The movie ends on a crime report detailing the state of their corpses as someone knocks on the mansion door. The naked sisters again cling to each other desperately as audio plays of an investigator questioning them on the murder, followed by Christine screaming for Lea."

The Traags consider Oms animals, and while they keep some as pets, others live in the wilderness and are periodically slaughtered by the Traags to control their population. Traags have much longer lifespans than Oms, but reproduce much less. When an Om mother is teased to death by three Traag children, her orphaned infant is found by Master Sinh, a key Traag leader, and his daughter Tiwa, who keeps the boy as a pet and names him Terr. Tiwa loves Terr and is careful not to hurt him, but, in accordance with her parents' instructions, gives him a collar with which she can pull him in any direction. She brings Terr to sessions in which she receives her education using a headset that transmits knowledge into her mind; a defect in Terr's collar allows him to receive the knowledge too. Around the time that Tiwa grows into her teens and first performs Traag meditation, which allows the species to travel with their minds, she loses some interest in Terr, who has become a young man and acquired much Traag knowledge. He escapes into the wilderness, stealing Tiwa's headset. There he runs into a wild female Om, who cuts off his collar and introduces him to her tribe, which lives in an abandoned Traag park full of strange creatures and landscapes. Terr shows them how to use the headset to acquire Traag knowledge and literacy, winning the right to do so in a duel. The literacy they gain allows them to read a Traag announcement that the park will be purged of Oms, and, when the purge comes, some are slaughtered by Traag technology while others escape, joining forces with another tribe. They are attacked by two Traag passers-by and manage to kill one of them before escaping to an abandoned Traag rocket depot, much to the outrage of Traag leaders. They live there for years, joined by many other Oms. Due to the knowledge acquired from Terr's headset, they manage to replicate Traag technology, including two rockets; they hope to leave Ygam for its moon, the Fantastic Planet, and live there safe from Traags. When a large-scale Traag purge hits the depot and many Oms are slaughtered, a group led by Terr uses the rockets to flee to the Fantastic Planet, where they discover large statues that Traags travel to during meditation and use to meet beings from other galaxies in a strange mating ritual that maintains their species. The Oms destroy some of the statues, threatening the Traags' existence; the genocide of Oms is halted on Ygam, and, facing a crisis, the Traags negotiate for peace. The Oms agree to leave the Fantastic Planet to the Traags for their meditations, and in return, an artificial satellite is put into orbit around Ygam and given to the Oms as a new home. This leads to an era of peaceful coexistence between the two species, who now benefit from each other's way of thinking."

Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called it \"disquieting, eerie and vastly imaginative.\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four and called it \"an animated piece of science-fiction pretending to be a Meaningful Statement \u2026 According to publicists for the film, the visuals and story begin to make sense if your mind is chemically altered. I doubt it.\" Among retrospective reviews, Carson Lund of Slant Magazine gave the film a score of three-and-a-half out of five possible stars, writing that \"by the film\u2019s conclusion, it\u2019s hard to feel comfortable with similar episodes on our own imperfect planet\". Mike D'Angelo of The A.V. Club gave the film a rating of \"B+\", writing that \"Fantastic Planet [should] seem extremely dated, yet it\u2019s ultimately too singular to feel beholden to a particular era. It truly earns the adjective in its title\". Alan Morrison of Empire gave the film four out of five stars and called it \"Surreal and wonderful in a way not often seen from Europe\". Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide gave the film three out of four stars, calling it an \"Eerie, surreal and a welcome respite from Disney-style animation\". Scott Thill of Wired called the film \"a sterling example of the trippy animation ambition of the late '60s and early '70s\". Gary Dauphin of The Village Voice wrote that \"Although the visuals are worth the ticket alone, Fantastic Planet also crackles with emotional and political resonance\". Paul Trandahl of Common Sense Media gave the film a rating of four out of five stars, calling the film \"A jarring examination of racism and intolerance\". In 2016, Fantastic Planet was ranked the 36th greatest animated movie ever by Rolling Stone. Included among the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, edited by Steven Schneider."

It was the third and final DreamWorks Animation film co-produced with Aardman Animations following Chicken Run (2000) and The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005), and was the first Aardman project completely made in CGI animation as opposed to their usual stop-motion. The film stars the voices of Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Shane Richie, Bill Nighy, Andy Serkis, Ian McKellen and Jean Reno. In Flushed Away, a pampered pet mouse named Roddy St. James is flushed down the toilet by Sid, a sewer rat, and befriends a sewer scavenger named Rita Malone in order to get back home while evading a sinister toad and his rat minions. The film was released in the United States by Paramount Pictures on 3 November 2006, and in the United Kingdom on 1 December 2006. Despite receiving positive reviews, Flushed Away underperformed at the box office, prompting DreamWorks to end their partnership with Aardman. The film received nominations for the BAFTA Award and Critics' Choice Award for Best Animated Feature. It also got 8 nominations at the 34th Annie Awards, winning a leading 5, including Writing in a Feature Production, and Voice Acting in a Feature Production award for Ian McKellen."

        "content": "Roddy St. James is an upper class pampered pet mouse who makes his home in a posh Kensington luxury apartment. While his owners are gone away on holiday, a common sewer rat named Sid spews out of the sink's drain and wants to stay, especially as England are playing against Germany in the World Cup Final. Roddy tries to get rid of Sid by luring him into the toilet, but the latter is not fooled. Instead, Sid pushes Roddy in and flushes down into the underground sewers. Roddy finds himself in Ratropolis, a city made out of various bits of junk that resembles London, and meets Rita Malone, an enterprising sewer scavenger rat who works the drains in her faithful boat, the Jammy Dodger. Rita is irritated by Roddy initially but ends up taking him along. Her arch-nemesis the Toad sends his rat henchman, Spike and Whitey, after her for stealing back her father's prized ruby. The Toad loathes all rodents, and plans to have Roddy and Rita frozen with liquid nitrogen. The pair escape and Rita takes a unique electricity master cable that is required to control Ratropolis' sewer floodgates. Roddy discovers that the ruby is a fake and breaks it in front of Rita. Furious, Rita tries to fight and attack Roddy, but eventually calms down and explains that she is only angry because her father (quite-literally) broke every bone in his body trying to obtain it just for her only for her to find out about its worthlessness. Roddy offers Rita a real ruby if she takes him back to Kensington, to which she agrees, and the pair first stop to visit her family before setting off. During Roddy's stay, he overhears a conversation that causes him to think that Rita is selling him to the Toad, so he reneges on the deal and steals the Jammy Dodger. When Rita catches up to him, she is able to clear up the misunderstanding. The pair evade pursuit from Spike, Whitey, and their accomplices, and incensed at his minions' repeated failures, the Toad sends for his French cousin, known as Le Frog. It is revealed that the Toad was Prince Charles' favorite childhood pet until he was abruptly replaced by a pet rat and flushes down a toilet, resulting in his hatred of rodents. Le Frog and his subordinates intercept Roddy and Rita to retrieve the cable, but the duo manages to escape out of the sewer drain and back to Roddy's apartment, though the Jammy Dodger is destroyed. Roddy pays Rita the promised ruby and an emerald then shows her around his apartment. She at first believes he has family in the home, but notices his cage and realizes he is a pet. Rita tries to persuade Roddy to come with her, but he is too proud to admit that he is sad and lonely. She leaves, but is soon captured by the Toad. Talking to Sid about half-time, Roddy pieces together the Toad's plan: to open the gates during halftime of the World Cup, when all the humans will most likely be using their toilets. As a result, a great wave of drainage will form and flood Ratropolis, allowing the Toad to use the depopulated city as a home for his tadpole children. Roddy entrusts Sid with his home and cushy position, and has Sid flush him back to the sewers. He frees Rita, and together they defeat the Toad and his henchman by getting Toad and Le Frog\u2019s tongues stuck to moving gears and freeze the wave of drainage with his liquid-nitrogen. Roddy later joins Rita as a first mate of the Jammy Dodger II. As they set off in the new boat, Le Frog and his hench-frogs are seen hitchhiking back to Paris, France. In a mid-credits scene, Roddy's former human owner Tabitha returns home and brings a new pet cat to surprise him, which scares Sid."

        "content": "The idea for a film about rats that fall in love in sewers was proposed by animator Sam Fell during the production of Aardman Animation's Chicken Run (2000). At the time, Aardman encouraged everyone at the company to come up with ideas for features for the DreamWorks partnership. In 2001, Fell, development executive Mike Cooper, and producer Peter Lord then developed the concept into a story before pitching it to DreamWorks. The film was first announced in July 2002, and in what was then a surprise move, it was revealed as being Aardman's very first CGI feature project. Lord described the pitch as \"The African Queen with the gender roles reversed\". After the film was announced, Comic writing duo Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais were contracted to write the script, which had the working title Ratropolis. In 2003, David Bowers joined in to direct the film with Fell. Traditionally, Aardman has used stop-motion for their animated features, but it is complex to render water with this technique, and using real water can damage plasticine models. It would have been expensive to composite CGI into shots that include water, of which there are many in the movie, so they chose to make Flushed Away their first all-CGI production. This is the third and final of three Aardman-produced films released by DreamWorks. Aardman's experience with DreamWorks during the making of the film led to a split between the two studios."

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale. Todd McCarthy of Variety gave the film a negative review, saying \"As directed by David Bowers and Sam Fell, first-time feature helmers with long-term Aardman affiliations, the film boasts undeniably smart and eye-catching qualities that are significantly diluted by the relentlessly frantic and overbearing behavior of most characters; someone is always loudly imposing himself upon another, to diminishing returns of enjoyment.\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B+, saying \"Flushed Away lacks the action-contraption dottiness of a Wallace and Gromit adventure, but it hits its own sweet spot of demented delight.\" James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"It's better than 90% of the animated fare of the last few years. It's refreshing not to have to qualify the movie's appeal by appending the words, 'for the kids'.\" Jan Stuart of Newsday gave the film two out of four stars, saying \"Despite the efforts of five writers and Aardman's trademark puppets, with their malleable eyebrows and cheeks bulging like those of a mumps sufferer, none of these characters are particularly endearing.\" Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, saying \"Flushed Away, Aardman's first computer-generated cartoon, does away with the clay but leaves the craft and emotion intact, resulting in a film that earns its place among the Aardman classics.\" Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"The short attention spans of directors David Bowers and Sam Fell are mostly forgivable because the movie is filled with so many entertaining characters.\" Richard Corliss of Time gave the film a negative review, saying \"Deficient in the comedy of reticence discouragement that is Aardman's (or maybe just Nick Park's) unique strength. I don't want to say the Englishmen were corrupted, but I think they allowed their strongest, quirkiest instincts to be tethered.\" Ted Fry of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying \"Fans of Wallace and Gromit may be puzzled by a visual disconnect in Flushed Away. They will certainly, however, be delighted by the unrelenting whimsy and fast-paced gags of a story that never slows down to think about where it's going next.\" Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film two and a half stars out of five, saying \"Kids will probably be in stinky-sewage heaven with the new computer-animated critter comedy Flushed Away, but even they may realize they're up the proverbial creek in a boat with a faulty motor.\" Jack Mathews of the New York Daily News gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying \"Though Flushed Away duplicates the stop-motion, clay animation look of Aardman's earlier Chicken Run and Wallace & Gromit, it was made using computer software and its liberated action sequences are truly dazzling.\" Kyle Smith of the New York Post gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"How this thing got made in Hollywood is a mystery, but I laughed at most of it, especially the mean stereotypes about the French and the even meaner stereotype about England's soccer team.\""

He is very drunk but is charmed by the young girl, and he invites her to a premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theatre. Adhering to his policy of living life with a sense of humor, he picks her up in a jalopy rather than a limousine and then gives the parking valet the car as a tip. Max takes Mary home with him after the event, but the next morning remembers nothing about the previous night. She reminds him he promised her a screen test and expresses concern about his excessive drinking and flippant attitude, but he tells her not to worry. Mary's first screen test reveals she has far more ambition than talent, and she begs for another chance. After extensive rehearsals, she shoots the scene again, and producer Julius Saxe (Gregory Ratoff) is pleased with the result and signs her to a contract. Just as quickly as Mary achieves stardom, Max finds his career on the decline, and he avoids a romantic relationship with her for fear she will be caught up in his downward spiral. Mary meets polo player Lonny Borden (Neil Hamilton). He genuinely loves her and, although he is jealous of the demands made on her by her career, he convinces her to marry him, against Julius and Max's better judgment. Lonny becomes increasingly annoyed by the dedication of his movie star wife to her work, and finally walks out on her. After their divorce is finalized, Mary discovers she is pregnant. Mary wins the Academy Medal for Best Actress, but her moment of glory is disrupted when she's called upon to post bail for Max after he's arrested for drunk driving. She takes him to her home, where he wallows in self-pity despite her encouragement. Later, alone in Mary's dressing room, he stares at his dissolute image in the mirror and compares it to a photograph of himself in earlier days. Having stumbled on a gun in a drawer, he kills himself with a bullet to the chest. Mary becomes the center of gossip focusing on Max's suicide. Hoping to heal her emotional wounds, she flees to Paris with her son and reunites with Lonny, who begs her to forgive him and give their marriage another chance."

Producer David O.

By the time Selznick convinced them the picture had potential, Bow was committed to another film. Constance Bennett considered What Price Hollywood? her best film. Four years after the film was released, Selznick approached Cukor and asked him to direct A Star Is Born (1937) starring Janet Gaynor and Fredric March. The plot was so similar to What Price Hollywood? that Cukor declined. RKO executives considered filing a plagiarism suit against Selznick International Pictures because of the similarities in the story, but eventually opted not to take any legal action.

        "content": "When the existence of a strain of plague (vaguely identified as pneumonic) is revealed at the US mission at the International Health Organization, three terrorists seek to blow up the US mission. Two of them are shot, one mortally, by security personnel, but one escapes. The surviving terrorist is hospitalized and quarantined and identified as Swedish. Elena Stradner and US military intelligence Colonel Stephen Mackenzie argue over the nature of the strain, which Stradner suspects is a biological weapon but which Colonel Mackenzie claims was in the process of being destroyed. The third terrorist, Eklund, escapes and stows away on a train bound from Geneva to Stockholm. Stradner believes that the train should be stopped so that the terrorist can be removed and quarantined, but Col. Mackenzie is concerned that all of the passengers on the train might be infected. Mackenzie insists on rerouting the train to a disused railway line which goes to a former Nazi concentration camp in Janov, Poland where the passengers will be quarantined. However, the line crosses a dangerously unsound steel arch bridge known as the Kasundruv Bridge or the \"Cassandra Crossing\", out of use since 1948 (former railway Zagorz-Solina-Turka-Lviv between Poland and Ukraine) Mackenzie understands that the bridge might collapse as the train passes over it. The presence of the infected terrorist, and the rerouting of the train, precipitates the second conflict, among passengers on the train; they include Jonathan Chamberlain, a famous neurologist, his ex-wife Jennifer Rispoli Chamberlain, a former inmate of Janov and Holocaust survivor Herman Kaplan, and Nicole Dressler, the wife of a German arms dealer. She is embroiled in an affair with her young companion Robby Navarro. Navarro is a heroin trafficker being pursued by Interpol agent Haley, who is travelling undercover as a priest. Mackenzie informs Chamberlain of the presence of Eklund, who is found, but attempts to remove him via a helicopter are unsuccessful because the train enters a tunnel. Chamberlain is also told that the plague has a 60% mortality rate.  Mackenzie, however, informs passengers that police have received reports of anarchist bombs placed along the rail line, and that the train will be rerouted to Nuremberg. There the train is sealed with an enclosed oxygen system and a US Army medical team is placed aboard, with the now-deceased terrorist being placed in a hermetically-sealed coffin. Chamberlain learns of the risk of the Cassandra Crossing. He also begins to suspect the disease is not as serious as originally thought: few of the passengers have become infected and few of those have actually died. He radios MacKenzie suggesting the infected portion of the train be uncoupled and isolated, but MacKenzie, acting under orders, has no intention of stopping the train: if, as expected, the Cassandra Crossing collapses, it will neatly cover the fact that the U.S has been harbouring germ warfare agents in a neutral country. Chamberlain and Haley form a group of passengers to overcome the guards and seize control of the train before it reaches the doomed bridge. After Navarro is killed by the guards trying to reach the engine, and Haley and Kaplan sacrifice themselves, Chamberlain manages to separate the rear half of the train, hoping that with less weight the front half will cross safely. But the bridge collapses, killing everyone aboard the front half. Max, the train's conductor, applies the manual brakes and stops the remaining cars just before reaching the downed bridge. The survivors soon evacuate the remaining cars and head off on foot, no longer under guard or quarantine. In Geneva, both Stradner and MacKenzie depart: she keeps hope of survivors while he feels quiet guilt over the whole affair. After they leave, Major Stack informs MacKenzie's superior that both the colonel and the doctor are under surveillance."

        "content": "Needing extra money, Chris decides to get a newspaper route, to help pay for a birthday gift for a girl he likes. Among those on his paper route is an old man named Herbert who is sexually attracted to Chris. Chris later gives his crush a present, but his clumsiness and over-eagerness scares her off. Nevertheless, he decides to retain the paper route. Shortly thereafter, however, Chris witnesses a robbery at a convenience store, and his bike ends up being stolen by the burglar as a getaway vehicle (even though he takes the bike but runs on foot). Later, at the police station, Chris identifies the thief from a police lineup. However, Peter shows up and tells the thief (unknowingly) that he is here to pick up Chris who was going to \"finger the guy who held up the convenience store\" and then proceeds to give the thief a picture of Chris, along with various other personal information. When the thief escapes and swears vengeance on Chris, the family is placed in the Witness Protection Program where they are relocated to Bumblescum, a tiny town in the deep South, to which Meg complains, although Lois remains somewhat optimistic. Deciding to embrace the South, Peter decorates his car like the General Lee, though he fails to roll the passenger window down for Brian when beckoning him to enter. He then becomes sheriff with Brian as his deputy, although the two neglect their responsibilities in order to drink. Stewie joins a hillbilly jug band, Meg becomes the most successful and popular student among her classmates (besting Oinky the Pig), and Chris makes a new friend named Sam. Later, when Peter interferes with a Civil War reenactment, claiming the North won the war, despite how they were being portrayed in the play, Sam's dad says Chris and Sam can no longer be friends and Peter and Brian have to answer to the civil war survivors. Not knowing of this, Sam unexpectedly kisses Chris, and Chris assumes Sam is gay. As Chris writes in a journal about what happened with Sam, Brian hears the story (as Chris was speaking out what he wrote), and he explains that kissing Sam seemingly felt right. When the two meet again, Chris explains to Sam that even though he is flattered that Sam likes him, he is not interested in a romantic relationship and feels that they are probably better off as just friends. Just before the two go swimming, Chris finds out that Sam is a girl, and due to his bad experiences around girls, Chris now feels awkward around Sam. At a party that is held that night, Sam explains to Chris that he had no problem talking to her, when he thought she was a guy, so she tells Chris to think of her as a boy who he can make out with. After the FBI agents who were hired to look over the Griffins home in Quahog accidentally reveal the location of the family (telling the criminal where Meg was, but not Chris), the criminal tracks the family down in Bumblescum, and attempts to kill Chris. During the confrontation, however, the criminal is shot and killed by Sam's father. With the criminal gone, the Griffins return to Quahog with Chris having to leave Sam behind. Once they are home, they realize that someone had left 113 messages on their answering machine, all of which turn out to be from Herbert, who is looking for Chris."

When he learns from a co-worker that it is not a replica, but a functioning antique gun, the two form a friendship based around recreational target shooting and studying firearms history. Other disaffected teens join them, and they begin to call themselves \"the Dandies\". Dick becomes more and more attached to his gun, naming it \"Wendy\" and writing it love letters. The Dandies adopt an affected, anachronistic style of dressing and speaking, for example replacing the word \"killing\" with \"loving\". They treat their antique firearms as elaborate props, giving them names and backstories, playing games with them, and target shooting in an abandoned mining shaft that they decorate and call the Temple. They carry their guns at all times, but make a point of never showing off their guns in public. Dick's childhood nanny Clarabelle introduces him to her troubled grandson Sebastian, an African-American youth from out of town who is on probation for a weapons-related crime. The town's sheriff, Sheriff Krugby, appoints Dick as an informal probation officer for Sebastian, believing that Dick is a good role model. Dick allows Sebastian to break probation and asks him to join the Dandies, but only if he follows their idiosyncratic rules. One day, Sebastian gives the group a suspicious box full of guns, and soon breaks a club rule by firing another member's gun. The group's sole female member, Susan, becomes interested in Sebastian. Dick becomes upset by the changes Sebastian's presence has triggered. Sebastian tells Dick that his grandmother is too scared of \"gang violence\" to walk down the street to her cousin's home, and Dick proposes that the Dandies escort her there. Clarabelle panics when they encounter a deputy sheriff and ends up shooting him after a scuffle. The sheriff asks the Dandies to hand over Clarabelle, telling them they can keep their guns if they do so. The Dandies believe that they are being set up, and flee to the Temple with Clarabelle just as several other police officers arrive. Despite the fact that they are now wanted by police, the Dandies decide to finish taking Clarabelle to her cousin's, treating it as a suicide mission. Sebastian discovers Dick's final letter to Wendy, which ends with the coded threat: \"And now, it's the time of the season for loving.\" Armed, they head outside to face the team of shotgun-toting police officers. A gunfight ensues, during which most of the Dandies are killed or wounded, and Clarabelle is hit in the leg by a ricocheting bullet. Although he is also wounded, Dick manages to get Clarabelle to her cousin's house, but loses his gun Wendy in the confusion. Police officers surround the home. Sebastian, unhurt, remains hidden outside. Noticing Wendy on the street, he picks it up and runs into Clarabelle's cousin's home, where he shoots Dick with Wendy. The police on the roof across the street open fire on the building."

The 26th episode of the series overall, it originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 7, 1991. In the episode, Homer gets an illegal cable hookup. Despite the family's enjoyment of the new channels, Lisa suspects they are stealing cable. Her suspicions are confirmed by Reverend Lovejoy and she protests by no longer watching television. Homer invites his friends to watch a cable-TV boxing match, but Lisa's protest persuades him to cut the cable when the fight ends. The episode was written by freelance writer Steve Pepoon and directed by Rich Moore. It is based on the Eighth Commandment (\"Thou shalt not steal\").

        "content": "After seeing Ned Flanders reject an offer from a crooked cable man for a $50 illegal cable hookup, Homer chases after the cable man and takes the offer. The Simpsons like the new channels and spend hours watching them. However, Lisa is suspicious about the cable hookup, and after a Sunday school lesson about the existence and nature of Hell, she fears that Homer is violating the Eighth of the Ten Commandments \u2014 \"thou shalt not steal\" \u2014 and will go to Hell when he dies. After seeing other examples of common thievery everywhere, Lisa visits Reverend Lovejoy. He dissuades Lisa from reporting her father's illegal cable hookup to the police since the Fifth Commandment states one must \"honor thy father and thy mother\", but instead advises her to lead by example and refuse to watch programs via the cable hookup. Marge pleads with Homer to either cut the cable or pay for it, but he refuses. However, after the cable man offers to sell him a stolen car stereo and attempts to break into Ned's house, Homer barricades his windows in fear. Bart one evening discovers a porn channel called \"Top Hat Entertainment\" and despite fear of punishment from Homer who unfortunately spots him watching it, Homer lets Bart off with a warning telling him not to watch the channel again. Bart pretends to agree to this and behind Homer's back charges the neighborhood children 50 cents to watch the cable porn channel, but just as it begins Homer catches him and sends him to his room as punishment. Homer invites his co-workers and bar buddies to watch Drederick Tatum fight for the World Heavyweight Championship during a cable-TV boxing match. Unfortunately for Homer Mr Burns also finds out and decides to attend the gathering to watch the match. When Lisa announces she will boycott the screening, Homer banishes her to the lawn, where she is joined by Marge and Maggie. Eventually Homer's conscience bothers him and he begrudgingly chooses not to watch the fight, dragging Bart outside with him. When his friends leave, Homer hesitantly cuts the cable hookup over Bart's objections. Homer accidentally cuts the neighborhood's electric power when he severs the wrong cable. He cuts the right cable on his third try, ending the episode abruptly with static showing onscreen."

        "content": "\"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\" was written by freelance writer Steve Pepoon and directed by Rich Moore. It was originally going to be named \"Homer vs. the 8th Commandment\", but the writers decided to include Lisa in the title because they wanted the cast to feel as if all their characters were equally represented on the show. The episode is based on the Eighth Commandment (\"thou shall not steal\"), which is one of the Ten Commandments. The Simpsons writer Al Jean said that \"whenever people come up to me and say that The Simpsons is just sort of this outrageous show that has no moral center, I always point them to this [episode], where Homer gets an illegal cable hook-up (which many people have done in real life) and suffers enormous consequences.\" The Simpsons writer Mike Reiss feels that episodes such as \"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\" are his favorite episodes to write because they have a \"solid theme or an issue\" (in this case, religion and theft), that one can \"discuss endlessly and just have it present itself in so many different ways\". Producer Jeff Martin said the writers tried to use a \"very strict construction of the Eighth Commandment,\" considering cable theft to be \"essentially a victimless crime\". \"Homer vs. the 8th Commandment\" was produced at a time when illegal cable hookups were becoming commonplace in many homes. This episode later inspired the season four episode \"Homer the Heretic\", in which Homer stops going to church on Sundays. Based on the Fourth Commandment, \"remember the Sabbath and keep it holy\", that episode originated when Jean commented to Reiss, \"We had a lot of luck with Homer stealing cable, so maybe we could look to other commandments?\" The episode marks the debut appearance of the character Troy McClure, voiced by Phil Hartman. McClure was based on the typical \"washed up\" Hollywood actor, and B movie actors Troy Donahue and Doug McClure served as inspiration for his name and certain character aspects. According to show creator Matt Groening, Hartman was cast in the role due to his ability to pull \"the maximum amount of humor\" out of any line he was given. McClure's visual appearance is similar to that of Hartman himself. McClure became a recurring character on the show after \"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\", but was retired in 1998 after Hartman's death. In addition to McClure, Hartman also provided the voice of the cable guy. The character Drederick Tatum, one of the boxers in the boxing match Homer and his friends watch, also makes his first appearance on the show in this episode. His physical appearance was based on the American boxer Mike Tyson, and he was named after a real boxer Simpsons writer George Meyer had seen."

The films that are watched by the family on the new cable are Jaws, Die Hard, and Wall Street. One of the X-rated films Bart and his friends watch on cable is called Broadcast Nudes.

Pinsky writes that the episode has \"the structure of an exquisitely crafted twenty-two minute sermon\". DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson felt that \"[The episode] helped establish the show's reputation as a master lampooner of pop culture. The introduction of cable into the home allowed [the writers] to mock many different movies and other media outlets, and this helped make the episode very entertaining. It also worked in many other ways and offered a fine show.\" Writing for MacLean's magazine, Jaime J. Weinman described \"Homer vs. Lisa and the Eighth Commandment\" as \"the first truly great episode\u00a0\u2014 the one that established The Simpsons as the funniest and most multi-layered sitcom around. The story of Homer stealing cable was an excuse for dozens of parodies of early 90s cable TV, but it was also a story about Homer and his daughter and an examination of how we rationalize little acts of theft in our daily lives.\" The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called the episode a \"skilful demonstration of a moral dilemma that must have plagued millions since the inception of cable TV\". Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, wrote that \"Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\" is \"one of the many demonstrations that while [The Simpsons] may have pushed the censorship envelope for its day, it remained moral to its core. The running satire of cable programs is also quite amusing.\" The episode won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour).

        "content": "There are similarities between this film and the novel that contrast with Hideo Nakata's adaptation: The cursed tape in the movie is very similar to the one in the book, although the book version is much longer and more complicated. Both videotapes feature a message at the beginning along the lines of \"Watch until the end, you will be eaten by the lost\" and ending with \"Those that have viewed this tape are fated to die at this exact time seven days from now. In order to survive, you must-\"; the rest of the end message is taped over, and it is not until the end that Sun-Joo realizes that the rest of the message is about copying the tape and showing it to someone else. Choi also analyzes the tape sequences the same way Ryuji does in the book. He categorizes the parts into two categories: real scenes and abstract scenes. The realistic scenes are easy to spot, since they have dark blurry edges, and instants of darkness. Choi quickly concludes that those instants of darkness are eye blinks. The average man blinks twenty times per minute, whereas the average woman blinks fifteen times per minute. Considering this fact, this video was created by a woman, scenes filmed through her own eyes and images in her mind. Sadako / Eun-Suh is depicted as intersex in the movie. She has androgen insensitivity, meaning she is anatomically female, except she has a pair of testes beneath her vagina (she evidently does not have a penis). The movie starts with Sun-Joo interviewing a gallery owner that explains the theme of her exhibition: the beauty of women and the strength of men combined in one individual, a hint for those who have read the book. The movie is faithful to the storyline of the book, including the search for Sadako / Eun-Suh's clinical records, her origin story and her rape before being murdered. Like Sadako in the novels and nearly in Ring Kanzenban, Eun-Suh was raped before being thrown down the well. The rapist was her half-brother. Similarly to Sadako in Ring Kanzenban, she struggles to escape, defends herself by biting and drawing blood from her captives shoulder, and is ashamed when he discovers her testicular feminization syndrome. Though it is not as clearly explained, Eun-Suh appears to telepathically threaten to kill him for discovering her secret. Horrified, he strangles her unconscious before dropping her into a nearby well. In Eun-Suh's cursed tape this is briefly shown. Even though the film kills its supporting character the same way Ring did, the movie shares the book views on a pseudo-science-fictitious medical-mystery approach with its title and Choi's scientific research on viruses, and the conclusions he makes before his death."

        "content": "Gold Diggers of 1933 is a pre-Code Warner Bros. musical film directed by Mervyn LeRoy with songs by Harry Warren (music) and Al Dubin (lyrics), staged and choreographed by Busby Berkeley.  It stars Warren William, Joan Blondell, Aline MacMahon, Ruby Keeler, and Dick Powell, and features Guy Kibbee, Ned Sparks and Ginger Rogers. The story is based on the play The Gold Diggers by Avery Hopwood, which ran for 282 performances on Broadway in 1919 and 1920.  The play was made into a silent film in 1923 by David Belasco, the producer of the Broadway play, as The Gold Diggers, starring Hope Hampton and Wyndham Standing, and again as a talkie in 1929, directed by Roy Del Ruth. That film, Gold Diggers of Broadway, which starred Nancy Welford and Conway Tearle, was one of the biggest box office hits of that year, and Gold Diggers of 1933 was one of the top-grossing films of 1933.  This version of Hopwood's play was written by James Seymour and Erwin S. Gelsey, with additional dialogue by David Boehm and Ben Markson. In 2003, Gold Diggers of 1933 was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\"."

        "content": "The \"gold diggers\" are four aspiring actresses: Polly (Ruby Keeler), an ingenue; Carol (Joan Blondell), a torch singer; Trixie (Aline MacMahon), a comedian; and Fay (Ginger Rogers), a glamour puss. The film was made in 1933, during the Great Depression, and contains numerous direct references to it. It begins with a rehearsal for a stage show, which is interrupted by the producer's creditors who close down the show because of unpaid bills. At the unglamorous apartment shared by three of the four actresses (Polly, Carol, and Trixie), the producer, Barney Hopkins (Ned Sparks), is in despair because he has everything he needs to put on a show, except money. He hears Brad Roberts (Dick Powell), the girls' neighbor and Polly's boyfriend, playing the piano. Brad is a brilliant songwriter and singer who not only has written the music for a show, but also offers Hopkins $15,000 in cash to back the production. Of course, they all think he is kidding, but he insists that he is serious \u2013 he offers to back the show, but refuses to perform in it, despite his talent and voice. Brad comes through with the money and the show goes into production, but the girls are suspicious that he must be a criminal since he is cagey about his past and will not appear in the show, even though he is clearly more talented than the aging juvenile lead (Clarence Nordstrom) they have hired. It turns out, however, that Brad is in fact a millionaire's son whose family does not want him associating with the theatre. On opening night, in order to save the show when the juvenile cannot perform (due to his lumbago acting up), Brad is forced to play the lead role. With the resulting publicity, Brad's brother J. Lawrence Bradford (Warren William) and family lawyer Faneuil H. Peabody (Guy Kibbee) discover what he is doing and go to New York to save him from being seduced by a \"gold digger\". Lawrence mistakenly identifies Carol as Polly, and his heavy-handed effort to dissuade the \"cheap and vulgar\" showgirl from marrying Brad by buying her off annoys her so much that Carol plays along, but the two fall in love. Meanwhile, Trixie targets \"Fanny\" the lawyer as the perfect rich sap ripe for exploitation. When Lawrence finds out that Brad and the real Polly have wed, he threatens to have the marriage annulled, but relents when Carol refuses to marry him if he does. Trixie marries Faneuil. All the \"gold diggers\" (except Fay) end up with wealthy men."

        "content": "The film contains four song and dance sequences designed, staged and choreographed by Busby Berkeley.  All the songs were written by Harry Warren and Al Dubin.  (In the film, when producer Barney Hopkins hears Brad's music he picks up the phone and says: \"Cancel my contract with Warren and Dubin!\") \"We're in the Money\" is sung by Ginger Rogers accompanied by scantily-clad showgirls dancing with giant coins. Rogers sings one verse in Pig Latin. During filming, Berkeley overheard Rogers speaking in Pig Latin, and immediately decided to add a Pig Latin verse to the song. \"Pettin' in the Park\" is sung by Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell. It includes a tap dance from Keeler and a surreal sequence featuring dwarf actor Billy Barty as a baby who escapes from his stroller.  During the number, the women get caught in a rainstorm and go behind a backlit screen to remove their wet clothes in silhouette. They emerge in metal garments, which thwart the men's attempts to remove them, until Billy Barty gives Dick Powell a can opener.  This number was originally planned to end the film. \"The Shadow Waltz\" is sung by Powell and Keeler. It features a dance by Keeler, Rogers, and many female violinists with neon-tubed violins that glow in the dark.  Berkeley got the idea for this number from a vaudeville act he once saw \u2013 the neon on the violins was an afterthought. On March 10, the Long Beach earthquake hit while this number was being filmed: [it] caused a blackout and short-circuited some of the dancing violins. Berkeley was almost thrown from the camera boom, dangling by one hand until he could pull himself back up. He yelled for the girls, many of whom were on a -high platform, to sit down until technicians could get the soundstage doors open and let in some light. \"Remember My Forgotten Man\" is performed by Joan Blondell, with featured vocal solo by Etta Moten \u2013 who also dubbed Blondell's singing voice at the end of the number \u2013 and features sets influenced by German Expressionism and a gritty evocation of Depression-era poverty. Berkeley was inspired by the May 1932 war veterans' march on Washington, D.C. and FDR's speech about the \"Forgotten Man\" from the same year. When the number was finished, Jack L. Warner and Darryl F. Zanuck (the studio production head) were so impressed that they ordered it moved to the end of the film, displacing \"Pettin' in the Park\". An additional production number was filmed, but cut before release: \"I've Got to Sing a Torch Song\" was to have been sung by Ginger Rogers, but instead appears in the film sung by Dick Powell near the beginning."

        "content": "According to Sin in Soft Focus: Pre-Code Hollywood by Mark A. Vieira, Gold Diggers of 1933 was one of the first American films made and distributed with alternative footage in order to circumvent state censorship problems. Busby Berkeley, the choreographer and director of the musical numbers, used the lavish production numbers as a showcase of the female anatomy that were both \"lyrical and lewd\". \"Pettin' in the Park\" and \"We're in the Money\" are prime examples of this. The state censorship boards had become so troublesome that a number of studios began filming slightly different versions of censorable scenes. In this way, when a film was edited, the \"toned down\" reels were labeled according to district. One version could be sent to New York City, another to the South, and another to the United Kingdom. Vieira reports that the film had two different endings: in one, the rocky romance between Warren William and Joan Blondell \u2013 whom he calls \"cheap and vulgar\" \u2013 is resolved backstage after the \"Forgotten Man\" number. In an alternative ending, this scene never takes place and the film ends with the number."

Bree has no objections and continues to kiss him however she asks him to stop when she has an itch on her neck. Immediately George assumes it is something she ate but Bree believes her hives have some other cause. She shoos George out of the house and her hives abate. The following day, Bree visits her therapist Dr. Goldfine, who advises her that her sudden break-outs occur because she still feels that she is married. Bree shakes off the suggestion but knows deep down that it is true. She decides that she will have to overcome this since she would like to continue seeing George. That evening, Bree calls George to ask him if he would like to accompany her on a romantic overnight to a hotel. George happily accepts and reserves a hotel room. However, when they arrive at the hotel, Bree once again breaks out into hives. George manages to stop the hives by recommending the two stay in separate rooms. Later, the two have dinner and George gives Bree an antihistamine to help with her hives. George walks Bree back to her room and puts her to bed. As Bree sleeps, George watches her and takes off his tie. Bree wakes up hours later to find George watching her. She apologizes for her drunkenness and that George could have slept beside her. George then tells her that he would like to stay but is afraid her rash will return. Bree tells him that she will have to get over it since she loves him and wants to be with him. The two kiss and have sex. As George sleeps, Bree sits in an armchair with a bathrobe on wondering if she made the right decision. Gabrielle walks into the courthouse where David greets her and advises her to quickly change her wardrobe. Gabrielle refuses but David insists. As they walk out, they are followed by a man named Louis who had a restraining order filed against him. He asks David if he can have the order pulled but the woman who filed it would beg to differ. Louis then takes out a gun and points it at David who immediately pushes Gabrielle out of the way. The gun fires but David blocks it with his briefcase. Louis quickly runs and throws the gun at David. David takes possession of the gun however when he turns around he is mistakenly shot by a police officer. Gabrielle visits David the following day at the hospital where he is recovering. Gabrielle feeds him, and he wonders whether he should keep the case or not. On the day of Carlos' hearing, David asks the judge for a recess since he cannot represent Carlos. He tells Gabrielle that he has feelings for her. Carlos tells Gabby that he needs to get David back even if that means sleeping with him which he believes is all part of the plan. Carlos is clearly joking and thinks that this is all part of Gabrielle and David's plan. He goes on to say that he would rather be in prison than to have his wife sleep with the lawyer to get him out. The following day, David meets Gabrielle at her house where he follows her to the bedroom. She gives him her offer which involves a secret affair and concludes that she cannot divorce Carlos due to the guilt and humiliation. David kisses her, but she stops him when she knows that David is doing it out of lust and not of love. She demands that he be in court the following morning ready to defend Carlos. Nina questions Lynette on her fashion sense. Lynette appeases her co-worker, her boss and ultimately herself when she buys new designer suits which Tom immediately asks her to return them because of their expensive price. Lynette agrees thinking about her family's welfare but cannot resist wearing her favorite new suit to a business meeting the following day. Lynette carefully hides the price tags on the coat but the skirt tag pops out and Nina decides to help her by pulling it off. Lynette is disappointed but satisfied. She tries to win Tom over by buying him a new set of golf clubs. Tom hesitates at first but decides that sometimes parents need something to make them feel special too. Susan and her mother Sophie prepare for Sophie's upcoming marriage when the question of whether Mike will ask Susan to marry him comes up. Mike advises the two to keep their expectations high but not to expect it anytime soon since he wants it to be spontaneous. Meanwhile, Susan discovers Paul Young's arrival home and with the other neighbors calls the police since she believes he killed Mrs. Huber. When the police arrives, they ask the neighbors why Paul should be arrested, and Susan goes to fetch Mike. When the officer asks Mike if he has Mrs. Huber's journals or whether he heard a confession from Paul, he denies it. Susan looks shocked and the entire neighborhood returns to what they had been doing previously. That evening, Susan asks Mike his reasons. Mike explains that because he owned an unregistered gun, violated his probation, and demanded a confession while holding a man at gunpoint, he would be in more trouble than Paul Young would if both were arrested. Susan understands but Mike's answer still hurts her. The next afternoon, Paul visits Susan and asks her about Zach's whereabouts. Paul picks up a knife and slowly moves toward Susan demanding to know where he is. Susan tells him she gave Zach money to go to Utah to find him and that she would have taken him home but he still had feelings for Julie. Paul leaves thankful for the answer but angry of what she did. Mike confronts Paul on his reasons for returning to Wisteria Lane and when he tells him that Susan sent Zach away to Utah, Mike quickly runs towards Susan's home where he demands from her if she sent Zach away. Susan tries to explain herself but when she replies \"Yes\" he runs out of the house disgusted. Susan chases after him in her mother's wedding dress, telling him she loves him and begging for a second chance. Mike drives away and Susan sits in the middle of the street sobbing as Paul Young coldly stares back at her. At that moment, Bree, Lynette and Gabrielle stop what they are doing to comfort Susan."

        "content": "\"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\" is the second episode of the third season of the American animated television series The Simpsons. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 26, 1991. In the episode, Lisa wins a patriotic essay contest about the United States. She and her family attend the contest finals in Washington, D.C., where she is dismayed after watching a congressman accept a bribe. Lisa loses the contest when she pens a scathing screed condemning the government system, but the corrupt congressman is jailed and removed from office, restoring her faith in government. The episode was written by George Meyer and directed by Wes Archer. It was the first episode for which Al Jean and Mike Reiss served as show runners. It features multiple references to the 1939 film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, including the scene in which Lisa appeals to Lincoln's statue at the Lincoln Memorial for advice. Other Washington landmarks referenced in the episode include the White House, the Watergate Hotel, the Jefferson Memorial, the Washington Monument, the National Air and Space Museum and the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The episode acquired a Nielsen rating of 12.9, and was the third highest-rated show on Fox the week it aired. It received mostly positive reviews from television critics, who praised the episode for its satire on American politics. The timber industry criticized the scene in which Lisa witnesses a timber industry lobbyist offering a bribe to the congressman to allow loggers to raze the Springfield Forest. The scene was described as \"an easy shot at hard-working people whose only crime is to have been born in a timber town\"."

At a shrine to a feminist icon, she sees a corrupt congressman, Bob Arnold, taking a bribe from a timber industry lobbyist to allow loggers to clearcut Springfield Forest. Heartbroken and disillusioned by government corruption, Lisa destroys her winning essay. She pens a scathing indictment, \"Cesspool on the Potomac\", which condemns government greed and corruption and names the politician involved in the bribery. Lisa's essay elicits a hostile reaction from the judges and audience members. When word of her speech quickly spreads through the capital, Congressman Arnold is arrested, removed from office and sent to prison, where he becomes a born-again Christian. Lisa's essay fails to win the contest, but her faith in government is restored and the contest winner commends her courage and honesty."

        "content": "The episode was written by George Meyer. It is one of The Simpsons creator Matt Groening's favorite episodes of the earlier seasons because he thought it took the show to another level. Meyer said he has a \"deep suspicion of social institutions and tradition in general,\" which affected the way he wrote the episode. Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had written for The Simpsons since the start of the show, took over as show runners for the third season. Their first episode as show runners was \"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\" and they felt a lot of pressure about running the show. Jean and Reiss were so pressured that they did six to seven rewrites of the script to make it funnier. Jean said \"one reason for doing all these rewrites is because I kept thinking 'It's not good enough. It's not good enough',\" and Reiss added that \"we were definitely scared. We had never run anything before, and they dumped us on this.\" Wes Archer directed \"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\", which was one of the first episodes to feature the Simpson family traveling to a real-life location. Because much of the episode takes place outside of Springfield, new background and character designs had to be animated. The Simpson family visits several real-life landmarks in Washington, which the animators were able to draw with the help of photographs from the animation studio's library. The Simpsons director David Silverman grew up in the Washington area so he was able to help out with the designs. Marge's voice actor, Julie Kavner, said she loved the charm of the family \"just being on a trip and experiencing the hotel room they're staying at, and the integrity of Bart's character. You know, you just want to kill him for doing all those tricks and pranks.\" Jean believes this is one of the secrets of the show's success, the fact that it is about a family and the writers can use experiences from their own or their family's life as an inspiration in their writing. He thought \"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\" was a perfectly constructed episode in that sense."

        "content": "The title and plot of the episode are parodies of the 1939 film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, in which the character Jefferson Smith comes to Washington with patriotic enthusiasm, but is instead shocked to see evidence of corruption in the government. The Tampa Tribunes Curtis Ross called this reference one of the best film references in The Simpsons history. Lisa's visit to the Lincoln Memorial is a direct reference to Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, in which Smith appeals to Lincoln's statue for inspiration like Lisa did in the episode. In his book Abraham Lincoln in the Post-Heroic Era, Barry Schwartz writes that the scene with Lisa at the crowded monument shows how \"thoroughly Lincoln's moral and emotional significance has waned\". Mark Reinhart writes in the book Abraham Lincoln on Screen that the scene sums up \"with brilliant wit\" the American society's \"annoying and ultimately useless tendency to ask [themselves] 'What would Lincoln have done?' whenever [they] face a political or social dilemma\". Mr. Smith Goes to Washington was once again referenced on The Simpsons in the season fourteen episode \"Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington\". In addition to the Lincoln Memorial, other Washington, D.C. landmarks visited include the Jefferson Memorial, the Watergate Hotel (where the family stays), the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the White House, the National Air and Space Museum, and the Washington Monument. When the family visits the White House, they encounter then-First Lady Barbara Bush in the bathtub of one of the many bathrooms. Another American landmark mentioned in the episode is Mount Rushmore. In addition, Lisa proposes that the family attend the memorial of the fictional Winifred Beecher Howe, an early crusader for women's rights who later appeared on the unpopular 75-cent coins, according to Lisa. This is a reference to the Susan B. Anthony dollar, which was minted for only three years and never became popular. The episode makes references to several real-life persons. The piano-playing satirist who annoys Bart is a reference to Mark Russell and Tom Lehrer. Bob Arnold, the corrupt congressman, tells Lisa that there are quite a few women senators, but Lisa asserts that there are only two. (At the time, there were indeed only two, Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland.) Then-President George H. W. Bush is featured briefly in the episode. Shortly after it aired, Bush disparaged The Simpsons in a speech during his re-election campaign on January 27, 1992. At that point, family values were the cornerstone of Bush's campaign platform, so he gave the following speech at the National Religious Broadcasters' convention in Washington: \"We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons.\" As a result, Bush appeared in future episodes in a more negative light."

        "content": "\"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\" has been labeled as a satire on American politics. Michael Bitzer, in an edited book by Joseph Foy and Stanley Schultz entitled Homer Simpson Goes to Washington, said this episode \"espouses the virtues, vices, and varieties of American political culture, public opinion, and ultimately the American Dream\". Bitzer also wrote that The Simpsons, through \"skillful\" use of satire, demonstrates with this episode \"insights into the underlying political culture and public opinion of the United States' governing system (and, more broadly, society at large)\". In his book Gilligan Unbound: Pop Culture in the Age of Globalization, Paul Arthur Cantor said he was amazed by how far the episode was \"willing to take its corrosive satire of national politics\". He said it \"attacks the federal government at its foundation, the patriotic myths upon which its legitimacy lies. It makes fun of the very process by which patriotism is inculcated in the nation's youth, the hokey contests that lead children to outdo each other in progovernment effusions.\" When the corrupt congressman is arrested, Lisa proclaims \"The system works!\" Benedict Anderson wrote in the book The Spectre of Comparisons that series creator Matt Groening \"assumes that his tickled audience is confident that the system barely works [...] So why does he need to show a patriot at all, especially one who is a deluded little female block-head? Probably because he, too, wishes to be seen as giving America another chance. Mr. Lisa guarantees his good intentions.\" G\u00fcnter Beck, a lecturer for the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) at the Haifa Center for German and European Studies at the University of Haifa in Israel, compared Lisa's role in the episode to the nineteenth-century American poet and philosopher Henry David Thoreau. He writes that Lisa stands up against the public's indifference towards the political system that Thoreau criticized, and comments that the emphasis should be \"on the brave moral decision to stand up for principles and against the broad public. By this courageous act, 'to do what is right', an individual could save the well-being of the whole community. And indeed, Lisa's bravery is the impulse for the state's representatives to carry out their democratic obligations, so she can gladly notice 'The system works!' \u2014 her trust in democracy and its institutions is restored. Thoreau on the other hand, had no lasting trust in the system but only in the people themselves and in the individual's capacity to realize development and democracy.\""

        "title": "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington_Critical reviews",
        "content": "Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, praised the episode for being one of the best Lisa-centric episodes, and called Lisa's talk with Thomas Jefferson and her nightmare vision of politicians as pigs \"especially worthy of note\". Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a 4.5 rating and said it is one of the best episodes featuring Lisa, \"complete with poignant observations about politics\". He particularly enjoyed the appearance of Barbara Bush at the White House. The Austin American-Statesman's Steven Stein said this was the first episode of The Simpsons he saw. Even though he did not understand half the pop culture references, by the end of the episode he was a \"Simpsons convert\". He thought there was \"something exotic about an issue as serious as political corruption being dealt with in a cartoon and being interrupted by jokes about beer and, yes, doughnuts\". The episode was praised for its political satire. Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict called the episode a \"biting political satire in the guise of a children's oratory contest [which] signifies that this season of the series will be all over the map, both emotionally and logically\". Gibron added: \"Everything, from the Reader's Digest rants to the formulaic speeches of the youths, has a resounding ring of truth. And once the story moves to Washington D.C, our nation's capital is in for a royal reaming as well.\" Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend said the episode solidified the series' politically satirical voice as it \"bitch slapped the Bush administration\" that would later badmouth The Simpsons. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson, however, gave the episode a more negative review, stating that it \"has its moments but never seems like one of the series' better programs. Part of that stems from its somewhat icky ending. The show exhibits a tone that feels more appropriate to a less biting and cynical series. It starts well with Homer's obsession with Reading Digest. After that, the show seems more erratic, and it remains pretty average overall.\""

        "content": "According to The Plain Dealer's Rodney Ferguson, the timber industry was insulted by the scene in which a timber industry lobbyist offers a bribe to the corrupt congressman so that he can demolish Springfield Forest. The Oregon Lands Coalition, a pro-timber group in Salem, Oregon, \"bombarded\" the producers of the show with phone calls and mail protesting the episode. The coalition said it portrayed loggers unfairly and is \"allowing itself to be used by environmental extremists\". In an open letter to The Simpsons executive producer James L. Brooks, the coalition wrote: \"Rather than approach this issue with genuine concern for Mother Earth, you took an easy shot at hard-working people whose only crime is [having been] born in a timber town.\" Karen Clark, a payroll clerk for a timber company in Stayton, Oregon, said: \"The Simpsons portrayed us as greedy, bribery-type people. It didn't portray us as the everyday people\u2014mothers, fathers, good members of society\u2014that we are.\" Luke Popovich, vice president of the American Forest Council, wrote a letter to the show's producer to protest \"the fuzzy-headed characterizations that pass for political correctness, the thinking in Hollywood where people are not very serious about these issues, but interested in pushing the right hot buttons, scoring the right points with audiences\". The Simpsons creator Matt Groening responded to the criticism in an interview with TV Guide, in which he said he did \"research on the ecological damage caused by clear-cutting and over-logging [and] it's really appalling\". Jackie Lang, a timber industry activist in Salem who helped lead the protest against the Fox network and Groening, said she was appalled by Groening's response, and \"He will be sorry he ever made it.\" Jake Hogan, supervising producer of the show, defended Groening: \"[The episodes] are just little stories, little comedies\u2014stories that make people laugh.\" On October 15, 1991, Groening issued another statement to the public, in which he said: \"So now a few lumber companies have joined the nuclear power industry, right-wing preachers and high-ranking Republicans in attacking The Simpsons. We must be doing something right. I must point out The Simpsons is a cartoon show\u2014not 60 Minutes. Later in the show, the same lobbyist proposed drilling for oil in Teddy Roosevelt's head at Mount Rushmore. Please don't tell the oil companies about this.\" David Reinhard of The Oregonian commented on the criticism: \"Hollywood sharpsters can always make a group from the great American hinterland look ridiculous when it zeroes in on one show, particularly if that show is a cartoon. And the Oregon Lands Coalition's protest was a bit of an overreaction. But the environmental sloganeering of The Simpsons as well as Groening's cartoon commentary are symptomatic of a Hollywood and a popular culture that are hostile to the concerns and values of most Americans.\" After the episode aired, media researchers Robert Lichter and Linda S. Lichter found in a study of prime-time television that when shows dealt with business themes, 89 percent portrayed businessmen as swindlers or liars. The same day Groening released his second statement, The Simpsons publicist Antonia Coffman was invited by Wayne Giesy, sales manager of Hull-Oakes Lumber Co. in Bellfountain, Oregon, to visit Oregon and see \"responsible timber management\". Giesy said they wanted to show the producers \"how we log, how we manufacture, what goods we produce for everyone and how we replant for future generations. What most timber companies are interested in is a balanced program.\""

Based on the Mexican writer Francisco Rojas Gonz\u00e1lez's novel, Historia de un frac (\"Story of a Tailcoat\"), which he was not even credited for, the stories follow a black formal tailcoat cursed by a cutter as it goes from owner to owner, in five otherwise unconnected stories."

However, she is now married, and her husband John finds them together. John offers to show Paul his weapon collection, in particular his favorite hunting rifle. He deliberately loads it. Paul makes no move to escape and is shot by the jealous husband. As Paul feigns death, John claims to his wife, the sole witness, that it was an accident. Ethel finally realizes she loves John and tells him so; she agrees to support his story. Paul comes back to life, surprising the couple and telling them that John missed completely. Paul then leaves the couple, but later collapses in his limousine. He instructs his valet Luther to take him to the hospital to be treated. Later Luther offers the topcoat, complete with a bullet hole, as collateral for a $10 loan from his friend Edgar. Edgar is the butler of Harry Wilson, who is about to marry Diane. However, Diane's friend Ellen, who is divorcing her husband for infidelity, dares her to examine the contents of Harry's topcoat. She finds a love letter from someone called \"Squirrel\" to her \"passionate lion\". Harry overhears and persuades his best man George to pretend that he took Harry's topcoat by mistake after a party last night and that the letter is actually his. George, who has feelings for Diane himself, reluctantly agrees. Diane is completely fooled ... and begins to see George (whom she thought of as \"dim\") in an entirely different, much more romantic light. Diane learns the truth when Squirrel shows up. She dumps Harry and leaves with George. Afterward, Luther and Edgar pawn the topcoat for $10. It eventually ends up with Charles Smith, an unknown classical music composer. A friend arranges a meeting with famed conductor Arturo Bellini, who is impressed with his composition. He is offered the opportunity to conduct the premiere of his work at Carnegie Hall. At the last minute, he is informed he must be properly attired. Elsa hurriedly buys the topcoat for him, but it is a very tight fit. When he conducts, it rips at both shoulders and the audience erupts with laughter. Charles is brought to tears. However, Bellini stands up in his concert box, pointedly removes his own tailcoat and asks him to continue; one by one, the \"gentlemen\" in the audience remove their own tailcoats. After the triumphant performance, Charles donates the topcoat to charity. Joe, who runs a mission for the poor, delivers a letter to alcoholic panhandler Larry Browne. It is an invitation to his 25th anniversary college reunion, held at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Joe convinces Larry to attend, hoping it will help him rebuild his life. Larry manages to convince his former classmates that he is successful, even getting a job offer, but one of them, Williams, knows that Larry was a shady lawyer in Chicago who was disbarred. When one man cannot find his wallet, the group hold a mock trial, with Larry as the defendant and Williams as the prosecutor. In the end, Larry ultimately tells everything and leaves. The next morning, however, three of his classmates come to the mission to let him know the job is still his. The topcoat ends up in a second-hand shop, has an adventure with a tale featuring W. C. Fields, Phil Silvers and Margaret Dumont [see below]; where it is stolen by a thief. He wears it to get into an upscale illegal gambling parlor to rob the patrons. In his escape by plane, the jacket catches on fire and the panicked thief throws it out, with $43,000 of loot in the pockets. It lands by Luke and Esther, a poor Black couple. They take it to their minister, and they decide to give it to their congregation to buy whatever they have prayed for. An old farmer tells Luke that the only thing he prayed for is a scarecrow, so Luke gives him the now ragged jacket to make one."

A conman (Fields) buys the jacket from the second-hand store that acquired it from the rescue mission of the fourth tale, thinking that it is stuffed with money from its former owner, who, according to the crooked shop salesman (Silvers), was \"a millionaire\". The conman wears the jacket to a lecture he is to give on abstinence from alcohol at the home of a wealthy woman (Dumont), where the coconut milk served as an alcohol alternative has been spiked with booze by her husband\u2014turning the lecture into a drunken party. The sequence was written primarily by Bert Lawrence, Anne Wigton, William Morrow and Edmund Beloin, with director Mal St. Clair \"advising (Duvivier) on gags and comedy routines for Fields and other comics.\" This tale was fifth in the sequence and was cut when the film was released to reduce running time. It was the easiest to cut without losing continuity, and, ironically, it was by far the funniest. Some sources indicate the \"running time\" was a convenient excuse; others among the cast were unhappy about the Fields sequence taking attention away from the rest of the film. This sequence was discovered in the Fox vaults in the mid-1990s seemingly intact. It was used in Kevin Burns' Hidden Hollywood II: More Treasures from the 20th Century Fox Vaults, a 1997 television documentary spotlighting cut sequences from the studio's films. It was later included as a supplement on the VHS release of the film. The Fox Movie Channel runs the film in its entirety, with all six tales intact and in their intended sequence."

        "content": "The final tale, starring Paul Robeson and Ethel Waters, depicted what were considered racial stereotypes even in 1942. It came under severe criticism from both Edward G. Robinson and Robeson, who was a champion of good film roles for Black actors. Tales of Manhattan was Robeson's final attempt to work within Hollywood, after making only 12 movies and refusing lucrative film offers for over three years. Robeson was deeply disappointed with the sequence, which featured musical numbers by Robeson and the Hall Johnson choir. He initially thought that he and his associates could use the depiction of the plight of the rural Black poor\u2014shown in the film as investing the bulk of their windfall in communal land and tools\u2014to demonstrate a share-and-share-alike way of life. Although he attempted to change some of the film's content during production, in the end he found it \"very offensive to my people. It makes the Negro childlike and innocent and is in the old plantation hallelujah shouter tradition ... the same old story, the Negro singing his way to glory\". To Robeson, it was a matter of human dignity, and outweighed what he considered his duty to promote communal ownership, inserted into the storyline for Robeson by screenwriter Donald Ogden Stewart, like Robeson a member of the Communist Party USA. Some reviewers and black entertainers (including Clarence Muse), noted that the film exposed Blacks\u2019 living conditions under the sharecropping system, but Robeson was so dissatisfied that he attempted to buy up all the prints and take the film out of distribution. Following its release, he held a press conference, announcing that he would no longer act in Hollywood films because of the demeaning roles available to Black actors. Robeson also said he would gladly picket the film along with others who found the film offensive."

        "content": "In 1792, Spain suffers amid upheaval from the French Revolution. Francisco Goya is a renowned painter who does portraits as the Official Court Painter to Spain's royalty, among others. The Spanish Inquisition is disturbed by some of Goya's work. Brother Lorenzo Casamares defends him and later hires him to paint his portrait.  Lorenzo says that his works are not evil, but simply depict evil. He recommends that the Church/Inquisition step up against anti-Catholic practices, and he is given power to intensify the Inquisition. While posing for Goya, Lorenzo sees a painting and asks about the model he uses, In\u00e9s, the daughter of rich merchant Tom\u00e1s Bilbat\u00faa. Later, In\u00e9s is spotted in a tavern by Holy Office spies (trained by Lorenzo) declining a dish of pork.  She is summoned by the Inquisition and arrested on charges of \"Judaizing\" by refusing pork. She is stripped naked and tortured by strappado (put to The Question) into a confession and then imprisoned. Her father begs Goya for help, who in turn asks Lorenzo to learn about In\u00e9s's situation. Lorenzo visits her in the dungeon, feigning to help her and pass a message to her family. He offers to pray with her, but struggles with his desire for her. Left naked, she prays with him at his request. Later, at a dinner in Bilbat\u00faa's home where he and Goya are guests, Lorenzo defends strappado (The Question). He argues that if the accused is innocent, God will give him or her the strength to deny guilt; therefore, a person who confesses under duress must be guilty. Bilbat\u00faa does not agree and argues that people will confess to anything under torture, to which Goya also agrees. Bilbat\u00faa then draws up a document which says that Lorenzo confesses to being a monkey, and with the help of his sons, tortures Lorenzo in the same manner, causing him to break down and sign it. Bilbat\u00faa promises to destroy the document if In\u00e9s is released. He gives Lorenzo a large gold 'donation' for the Church in the hopes it may persuade the Holy Office to release her. Lorenzo pleads for In\u00e9s, and the Inquisitor-General Father Gregorio accepts the money, but refuses her release, since she has confessed. Lorenzo again visits In\u00e9s, offering to pray with her, but instead rapes her. Later, her father brings the document to the king, Charles IV who is amused at reading it and promises to look into In\u00e9s' situation. The document is an embarrassment to the Holy Office, and Lorenzo flees when they come to arrest him. His portrait is confiscated and publicly burned in effigy. Fifteen years pass, and a now deaf Goya is at the height of his creativity. The French army invades Spain, abolishes the Inquisition and sets the prisoners free. Lorenzo had fled to France, and is now a fanatical adherent of the French Revolution. He has become Napoleon's chief prosecutor against his Inquisition ex-colleagues. (This twist in Lorenzo's allegiance may have been inspired by Juan Antonio Llorente.) A French show trial court convicts and sentences the Inquisitor-General to death. Left in the dungeons over the years, In\u00e9s has been losing her sanity. She gave birth to a daughter who was taken away at birth. Upon returning home and finding her family dead, In\u00e9s turns to Goya for help in finding her child. Lorenzo is the father, which is embarrassing for him, and he sends In\u00e9s to an insane asylum. Lorenzo questions the condemned Inquisitor-General, who tells him that a child born in the dungeon would've been placed at an orphanage. Lorenzo finds her and learns from the nuns that his daughter, Alicia, had run away several years prior. While sketching in Garden Park, Goya notices a prostitute named Alicia who looks just like In\u00e9s. He goes to Lorenzo and asks for In\u00e9s, so he can reunite her with her daughter. Lorenzo becomes worried and secretly visits Alicia at the park, offering to pay her passage to America if she leaves Spain. She refuses, calling him insane. Meanwhile, Goya visits the asylum where Lorenzo had stashed In\u00e9s and bribes the director to release her. He attempts to bring her to see Alicia at a tavern where prostitutes gather. As he tries to persuade Alicia, soldiers (on Lorenzo's orders) raid the place and arrest all the prostitutes. Goya learns that Lorenzo plans to sell them as slaves to America. Soon after, the deluded In\u00e9s wanders into the tavern and finds a baby left by its mother, who was taken in the raid. She is elated and steals the baby away thinking it's her lost child. The British are easily defeating the French with help from the Spanish populace.  They come over a hill and charge the wagons transporting the prostitutes. The French escort abandons the wagons, and Alicia catches the eye of a British officer. Lorenzo is caught fleeing the invasion, and Spain has reinstated the Inquisition.  Lorenzo is sentenced to death, with the Inquisitor-General reversing their earlier roles. He urges Lorenzo to repent as he is taken to the execution wearing a sanbenito with painted flames, indicating that he is sentenced to hell. On the scaffold, Lorenzo sees Alicia, next to the British officer, scoffing at him. He also sees Goya sketching the scene at a distance. In\u00e9s is also in the crowd, and she calls to Lorenzo, showing him the baby she thinks is their daughter. Refusing to repent despite pleas from his former colleagues, Lorenzo is garroted. The film ends with a cart taking Lorenzo's body away, escorted by In\u00e9s still carrying the child, with Goya following behind and calling for her. She glances back with a smile, but continues to accompany Lorenzo's body."

It features Vittorio Gassman in the main role. It was entered into the 1966 Cannes Film Festival. The term Armata Brancaleone is still used today in Italian to define a group of badly assembled and poorly equipped people.

        "content": "The movie opens with a small Italian village being stormed by a band of Hungarian pillagers. When the murders and rapes are over, a German knight arrives and bravely kills the bandits. However, as he is healing his wounds he is attacked by two of the surviving villagers and one of the thieves. They throw the wounded knight into a river. The attackers try to sell the knight's armor and weapons to a miserly Jewish merchant who finds among his belongings a letter of donation by the Holy Roman Emperor, granting the knight the fief of Aurocastro, an Apulian town. The parchment is torn at the lower end, which refers to a condition the knight must fulfill to enjoy the donation. The Hungarian bandit comes up with the idea to propose a partnership to a cadet nobleman, so the group can take possession of the aforementioned fief and enjoy its riches. The knight they find is the poor and incompetent, yet well-meaning, Brancaleone da Norcia and they tell him that a noble knight handed them the parchment before dying. Brancaleone initially refuses the plan but after a farcical defeat at a jousting tournament that promised the hand of an overlord's daughter and a wealthy fief, he is too eager to take command of this \"army\" (L'Armata) of underdogs and lead it towards \"fortune\" and \"glory\", in what he sees as an epic journey. As they set up towards the fief, Brancaleone lives several grotesque adventures, inspired by the confused and cosmopolitan world of Italy during Middle Ages; each one of them more hilarious than the last. These include: A Byzantine knight, Teofilatto dei Leonzi (Gian Maria Volont\u00e9), who proposes to fake his capture by the band so they can demand and share a ransom from his father. An entire city seemingly abandoned, which they begin to pillage, until they find out that it was depopulated by plague. A fanatical mad monk, Zenone (Enrico Maria Salerno), who promises that those who join his army of Crusaders will be \"healed\" from all ills, having the band follow him to a crusade in the Holy Land. When trying to convince his followers to cross a precarious bridge by leaping upon it (crying out loud that the Lord would protect them), the monk falls down into a deep gorge - this releases the band to follow their previous quest. The rescue of a bride named Matelda (Catherine Spaak), who falls in love with Brancaleone, but is rejected by him due to his oath to take her to her groom; to Brancaleone's misfortune, she avenges herself by losing her virginity to the Byzantine knight (by then a member of the gang); later, while the 'army' is relaxing at her nuptial feast her husband finds out about her state and she accuses Brancaleone of deflowering her. giving in to Teofilatto's plan, the army arrives at his father's castle to demand a ransom. His father refuses to pay, revealing that Teofilatto is his illegitimate child. Meanwhile, a confused Brancaleone has to fend off the sadomasochistically-fueled passion of Teofilatto's aunt, just one example of the inbred Byzantine household. When finally the band reaches the fief, they discover that the missing part of their parchment mentioned that condition for the granting of the fief was that its new ruler should have provided adequate defences against the \"black scourge coming from the sea\", frequent raids by Saracen corsairs. Brancaleone designs a cartoonish Rube Goldberesque trap to defeat the Saracens, but instead the band ends up trapped within. As the band is about to be executed by impalement, it is saved by the knight of the opening scenes, the rightful owner of the fief, thirsty for vengeance against his attackers. Brancaleone (who did not know about the attack on the knight) and his army are about to be burned alive when the mad monk arrives out of the blue and saves them from the knight, \"so they can fulfill their duty to go onto the Holy Land\". Being deprived of his dreams of richness, Brancaleone and his band agree to go along with the monk and his followers, saving themselves. Albeit sad, when he finds his untrustworthy horse, Brancaleone mounts and regains his confidence, taking the lead from the monk. The story is continued in a follow-up film, Brancaleone alle Crociate (1970)."

        "title": "L'armata Brancaleone_Evaluation and themes",
        "content": "The plot is structured as a series of sketches revolving around different parodies of the Middle Ages world: it is itself a parody of the classical knights' quest typical of Middle Ages tales. Age and Scarpelli devised for the characters a striking, mocking form of a mixture of Italian (including its dialects) and Latin languages, which is probably the main feature of the film and one of the keys to its success. Gassman's overbearing and pompous recitation was also perfect for the role. The main musical theme of the film was also a great success. According to Monicelli, the idea for the movie was spurred by a simple scene written by Age and Scarpelli, about two mediaeval peasants talking about women. Monicelli suggested that they shoot a movie which avoids the stereotypes of the usual Hollywood Middle Ages movies. It would instead show \"the other face\" of the era: poor people, underdogs, ignorance, mud, cold, misery. There is no such stereotype left standing: the oppressed villagers are capable of violence themselves (they are prey to the bandits, but join them to attack their saving knight); the clergy, depicted by the hallucinating monk, fanatical to the extreme, always capable of explaining misfortunes by \"lack of faith\" of his entourage; the miserly Jewish merchant; the heroine/princess in distress, who instead of ending up with the hero asks to be deflowered by another man just to spite him. Finally, the archetypical medieval hero, the knight, has in the clueless Brancaleone its greatest parody, always jeopardized by following his chivalric code of conduct; as for his dreams of glory, he leads an army of underdogs that are a little more than a band of cowardly bandits who flee from fights and feign submission while actively trying to manipulate him from the bottom. Underdogs and humiliated people were constantly present in Monicelli's art, but in this case they are shown mainly from a comical side. Another important theme of the film is male friendship, which was also an important element in movies such as La grande guerra and the later Amici miei. The costumes often provide a near-surreal effect, particularly in the wedding banquet and Byzantine castle scenes. Their designer, Piero Gherardi, won a Silver Ribbon for them in 1967."

The film is notable for its depiction of parkour in a number of stunt sequences that were completed without the use of wires or computer generated effects. Because of this, some film critics have drawn comparisons to the popular Thai film Ong-Bak. David Belle plays Le\u00efto, the main character of the story."

        "content": "In 2010, social problems have overrun the poorer suburbs of Paris. Especially Banlieue 13, commonly referred to as B13: a ghetto with a population of two million people. Unable to control B13, the authorities surround the entire area with a high wall topped by barbed tape, forcing the inhabitants within to survive without education, proper utilities or police protection. Police checkpoints stop anybody going in or out. Three years later, the district has become overrun with gangs. Le\u00efto  is a fighter of such gangs. He disposes of a case of drugs down a drain, then escapes the gang led by K2, an enforcer who has come to collect the drugs. The gang's leader, a ruthless man named Taha Ben Mahmoud is angered and executes 3 of K2's men until K2 suggests they kidnap Le\u00efto's sister Lola in retaliation. Lola is captured by K2 at a supermarket. Le\u00efto is able to rescue her and take Taha to the police station, but the police chief in charge betrays & arrests Le\u00efto and let Taha leave with Lola, stating that they are leaving the district and are not willing to stand up to the gangs. Despite the chief saying sorry, Leito is angered by the excuses and kills the chief out of frustration by breaking his neck. Six months later, undercover policeman Damien Tomaso completes a successful operation at an underground casino in Paris, single handedly taking down or gunning down the casino's guards and arresting the pit boss. His next assignment is briefed by Kruger a government official. Taha's gang has taken a bomb from a nuclear transport vehicle and accidentally activated it, giving it 24 hours before it wipes out the district. Posing as a prisoner, Damien infiltrates the district to disarm the bomb. Le\u00efto immediately sees through Damien's cover, but the two reluctantly team up to save Le\u00efto's sister as well. The pair surrenders to Taha in order to gain access to his base, where they find the bomb has been set up on a missile launcher aimed at Paris, with Lola handcuffed to it. Taha demands a high ransom to deactivate the bomb; the government refuses. After Damien gives them Taha's bank account codes, they drain his funds. Le\u00efto and Damien escape. K2 and his men soon realize that with Taha unable to pay them, they are free from his grasp. Taha attempts to command K2 as a last resort, but K2 fed up with Taha's brutality turns his back on his former boss and allows his men to gun down Taha. K2 takes over the gang and goes to find Leito and Damien After a footchase K2 catches up with Leito and Damien but calls a truce and allows Leito and Damien to disarm the bomb. Leito and Damien reach the bomb but are forced to fight a large man named Yeti who was planted by Taha to guard the bomb. After they defeat Yeti, Damien calls Kruger to receive the deactivation code. However, after Kruger suspiciously asks if the \"bomb is in the exact spot\" & recognizing certain symbols in the code specifically \"B13\" the last characters , Le\u00efto deduces that the government has framed them, and the code will actually detonate the bomb instead of deactivating it. Damien refuses to believe that the government has set him up and he fight Leito as Damien truly believes that he doing the right thing to disarm the bomb, Lola is able to restrain Damien long enough for the timer on the bomb to run out. The bomb does not explode, proving Le\u00efto right. K2 and his gang allow Leito and Damien to leave the district. The pair return to the government building with the bomb and use it to force Kruger to admit that he had planned to blow up B13 as a means to end its existence, catching it on camera and broadcasting nationally. Soon the rest of the government promises to tear down the containment wall and bring back schools and police to B13. Le\u00efto and Damien depart as friends, and Lola kisses Damien, encouraging him to visit B13."

The website's critical consensus reads, \"A nonstop thrill ride, District B13's dizzying action sequences more than make up for any expository flaws.\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100 based on reviews from 28 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". In France, reviews were slightly less positive. The main issues discussed by the French critics were the similarity with both Escape from New York and Ong Bak, and the shallowness of the plot. Lisa Nesselson of Variety notes the comparison, but says although the narrative is derivative it \"rarely feels that way thanks to bullet pacing, nifty choreography and a few well-placed rejoinders\" and also called it \"fast, dumb fun\". Nathan Lee of The New York Times that the director \"hasn't reinvented this particular wheel, but he gets it spinning with delirious savoir-faire.\" Several other critics also praised the film's action scenes and stunt work. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \"By most standards, District B13 is a fairly routine summer action movie, albeit one in French. But what makes it unique are the truly amazing and kinetic action scenes featuring Parkour pioneer Belle and co-star Cyril Raffaelli.\" Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe remarked, \"Like its stunt work, the movie is both ridiculously hyperactive and a muscular feat of absolute confidence. I don't expect to have a more adrenalizing time at the movies this summer.\""

        "content": "Professor Farnsworth invites the crew of Planet Express to join him at the Academy of Inventors' annual symposium, where inventors display their latest creations. He will be presenting his invention, the Deathclock, which displays the date of a person's death after that person's finger is stuck into the machine.  At the symposium, the crew encounter one of Farnsworth's former students, Professor Ogden Wernstrom. When he was still a student, Wernstrom received an A-minus on a pop quiz and vowed revenge, even if it took him 100 years. Just over 99 years have passed, so Farnsworth considers himself to be essentially in the clear. Wernstrom presents his invention, a reverse SCUBA suit that allows fish to breathe water while walking about on land, demonstrated by his fish, named Cinnamon. He then taunts Farnsworth over his invention from the previous year\u2014the Deathclock. Mortified that he had previously presented the device and forgotten about it, Farnsworth hastily begins drawing on a napkin. He presents the drawing, which depicts both a Smelloscope, a device that allows people to smell distant cosmic objects, and a doodle of himself as a cowboy. As the audience laughs, he sweats and wipes the napkin on his head by accident, blurring the picture. Wernstrom announces that the invention deserves \"the worst grade imaginable: an A-minus-minus.\" Back at Planet Express, Farnsworth invites everybody to see the Smelloscope that he had constructed last year and also forgotten about. Fry begins smelling Jupiter, Saturn, and other objects around the solar system and quickly discovers the smelliest object in the universe. After calculating its trajectory, Farnsworth announces that the object will collide with New New York City in 72 hours, reducing it to a \"stinky crater\" (Bender immediately starts looting at this news). After some research, they find a video that reveals the object to be a giant ball of garbage from Old New York, launched into space from a mob-obtained rocket in 2052. After warning Mayor Poopenmayer, a plan is hatched to destroy the garbage ball. The Planet Express crew (being the only ones who will take on such a suicidal mission) is sent on a mission to plant a bomb on a fault line next to coffee areas and deposits of AOL floppy disks on the ball. Farnsworth also reminds them that if it blew up any time later, the explosion would cause garbage to rain across the entire Earth, killing millions. Then, once set off, the bomb will be set to allow the crew twenty-five minutes to escape. When the crew lands on the ball, Fry is amazed by all of the 20th-century items on the ball. Such as: a Beanie Baby, a Mister Spock collectors plate, and Bart Simpson dolls; but Leela reminds Fry that these things were garbage, which is why they are in the garbage ball in the first place. Unfortunately, after starting the bomb, they find out the Professor put the bomb's countdown display in upside down, and it actually only allows 52 seconds. The crew panics, and Bender throws the bomb into space to save them, where it explodes harmlessly. The crew returns to Earth in shame. The Mayor then sends for Wernstrom for help. Wernstrom demands tenure, a grant, and five research assistants, at least three of whom must be Chinese. When the mayor agrees to his conditions, Wernstrom reveals that he has no plan, declares that he is set for life, and leaves. In a last-ditch effort to redeem himself, Farnsworth comes up with a second plan to save the city: launching a second ball of garbage to bounce against the first one and sending it flying into the sun without smashing to bits. The Mayor exclaims that there has not been garbage in New New York for 500 years, so there is no way to make such a ball. Fry seizes the moment and demonstrates how to make garbage. An announcement is made to tell the city to throw away everything. The city quickly generates a second ball of garbage, which is fired at the first garbage ball. The rocket flies into the air and hits the other garbage ball, which first slingshots around planets, then sending it into the sun, while the new ball flies out of the solar system. For saving the city from the garbage ball, Professor Farnsworth is given the inventor's award, which was confiscated from Wernstrom as punishment for him being a jackass. Wernstrom comments \"I will get you for this Farnsworth, even if it takes another 100 years!\" The others quickly dismiss Leela's concerns that the new garbage ball will return and destroy a future generation. Professor Farnsworth replies that it will not be for hundreds of years, presumably by the year 4000, prompting Fry to say \"That's the 20th Century spirit!\" Over the closing credits, the song \"We'll Meet Again\" plays instead of the standard Futurama theme."

        "content": "A man identifying himself as Dalton Russell, sits in a small, dark space he identifies as a cell. He proclaims he has committed the perfect bank robbery. In New York, masked robbers, dressed in painter coveralls and using variants of the name \"Steve\" as aliases, seize control of a Manhattan bank, taking patrons and employees hostage. They divide the hostages into groups and hold them in different rooms, forcing them to don coveralls identical to their own. The robbers rotate the hostages among various rooms and occasionally insert themselves covertly into the groups. They also take turns working on an unspecified project involving demolishing the floor in one of the bank's storage rooms. Police surround the bank, and Detectives Keith Frazier and Bill Mitchell take charge of the negotiations. Russell, the head robber demands food be provided. The police send pizzas whose boxes have hidden listening devices. The bugs pick up someone speaking Albanian, which is later identified as propaganda recordings of deceased Albanian leader Enver Hoxha, implying that the robbers anticipated the attempted surveillance. When Arthur Case, chairman of the board of directors and the bank founder, learns about the in-progress robbery, he hires \"fixer\" Madeleine White to try and protect the contents of his safe deposit box within the bank. Russell allows White to enter the bank and inspect the box's contents, which include documents from Nazi Germany. Russell implies that Case started his bank with money that he received from the Nazis for unspecified services, resulting in many Jews dying during World War II. White tells Russell that Case will pay him a substantial sum if he destroys the box's contents. Frazier demands to inspect the hostages before allowing the robbers to leave and Russell takes him on a tour of the bank. As he is being shown out, Frazier attacks Russell, but is restrained by another robber. Afterwards, he explains that he deliberately provoked Russell, and concludes he is not a killer. However, this is seemingly disproven when the robbers stage a hostage execution. The execution prompts an Emergency Services Unit team into action. They plan to storm the bank, using rubber bullets to knock out those inside. Frazier discovers that the robbers have planted a listening device on the police; aware of the police plans, the robbers detonate smoke grenades, remove their disguises, and exit the bank with the hostages. The police detain and question everyone but are unable to distinguish the identically dressed hostages from the robbers. A search of the bank reveals the robbers' weapons were plastic replicas. They find props showing that the hostage execution was faked, and no money or valuables appear to have been stolen. With no way to identify the suspects and unsure if a crime has even been committed, Frazier's superior orders him to drop the case. Frazier, however, searches the bank's records and finds that safe deposit box number 392 has never appeared on any records since the bank's founding in 1948. He obtains a search warrant to open it. He is then confronted by White, who informs him of Case's Nazi dealings. She attempts to persuade Frazier to drop his investigation, but he refuses, playing a recording he had surreptitiously made of an incriminating conversation that took place earlier between the two. White confronts Case, who admits the box contained loose diamonds and a diamond ring he took from a Jewish friend whom he betrayed to the Nazis. Russell repeats his opening monologue while hiding behind a fake wall the robbers had constructed inside the bank's supply room. He emerges a week after the robbery with the contents of Case's safe deposit box, including incriminating documents and several bags of diamonds. On his way out, he bumps into Frazier, who does not recognize him. He exits the bank and enters a waiting van filled with his conspirators, some of whom had been questioned by the police.  When Frazier opens the safe deposit box, he finds the ring and a note from Russell reading, \"follow the ring.\" Frazier confronts Case and urges White to contact the Office of War Crimes Issues at the State Department about Case's war crimes. At home, Frazier finds a loose diamond and realizes that Russell slipped the diamond into his pocket during their \"collision\" as Russell exited the bank."

He is assigned to negotiate with the ringleader of a Manhattan bank heist. The film marks Washington's fourth collaboration with director Spike Lee. Lee first approached Washington and gave him the opportunity to play either Frazier or Dalton Russell. Washington turned down the latter, citing concerns over the character's disguise. He cited his Broadway performance as Brutus in Julius Caesar as inspiration, stating, \"I think it actually helped me prepare for Frazier\u2014Russell [Gewirtz]'s script is heavy with great dialogue. My character does a lot of talking! I kind of thought of Frazier as Brutus goes to Brooklyn. For me, there is a certain rhythm and cadence of New Yorkers, and this gave me the opportunity to play a New York kind of guy who's going through a lot while dealing with this smart and challenging adversary.\" Clive Owen as Dalton Russell, the ringleader of the elaborate bank heist. Russell first appears at the beginning of the film, breaking the fourth wall and narrating in medias res of how he will commit the perfect bank robbery. Owen nearly turned down the role; like Washington, he expressed concerns over the character's disguise of a hood, mask and sunglasses. He said, \"To play whole scenes where you're masked, you've got on sunglasses and you're wearing a hood is very weird, because a lot of acting is often through intent, and intent is shown through the eyes. To suddenly have that taken away and have this big barrier there was very disarming.\" Owen, however, accepted the role after further discussing the part with Lee. The script was also revised to include scenes in which Owen's face could be shown. Jodie Foster as Madeleine White, Manhattan power broker who is hired to act as a \"fixer\" in response to the bank heist. Foster saw the film as an opportunity to collaborate with Lee, explaining, \"Spike is somebody who always fascinated me, and I've loved his movies. I've always wanted to be involved in something he's making.\" She described her character as a woman with \"a relaxed kind of witty quality to her. All the while being very strong, not having to raise her voice very much, not having to yell at anybody \u2014 she's got authority. There's seductiveness, a charm, if you will, to her ability to get into people's psyches that's been immensely fun to play. It all went way too fast for me.\" Christopher Plummer as Arthur Case, the chairman of the board of directors and founder of the fictional Manhattan Trust bank. In response to the bank heist, Case hires White to prevent a possible career-ending situation. Inside Man is Plummer's second collaboration with Lee and Washington, following 1992's Malcolm X. He described Case as a \"wonderful, rich head of all sorts of organizations \u2014 I suppose a kind of 'Enron creature' \u2014 who runs banks and other world businesses. He has tentacles everywhere, and he's a real son-of-a-bitch who's trying to keep a secret in the process.\" Willem Dafoe as Captain John Darius, veteran captain of the NYPD Emergency Services Unit. Dafoe saw the film as opportunity to work in New York City and collaborate with Lee. He felt that the film was \"about the city; it's about authority; it's about the mentality of crime; and it's about power ... and payback.\" Chiwetel Ejiofor as Detective Bill Mitchell, New York City police detective and Frazier's partner. The film is Ejiofor's second collaboration with Lee, after She Hate Me (2004). He first learned of the film after meeting with the director. He explained, \"He said he wanted me to read the script and see if I wanted to be involved. Spike asks so many people to come back and work with him in different capacities and as different types of characters.\""

Lee helped prepare his actors by screening a number of heist films including Dog Day Afternoon (1975).

By filming in New York, the production was eligible for the city's \"Made in NY\" incentives program. Interior sets were created at the New York-based Steiner Studios, and Inside Man was the second film (after 2005's The Producers) to be shot inside the 15-acre facility. Location scouting revealed a former Wall Street bank at 20 Exchange Place had been closed down and repurposed as a cigar bar.  The building stood in for the fictional Manhattan Trust Bank branch, where the bank heist occurs. \"Without a bank, we didn't have a movie,\" Lee explained. \"But everything ended up going very smoothly. We shot in the heart of Wall Street in a bank that had been closed down. It was like having a back lot in the middle of Wall Street.\" An office at the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House doubled as the office of Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer). Plummer believed that the office's design was essential to his character: \"The space literally presents Case's power, so I found that part of my character was to simply play very cool about everything. You don't have to push the power, because it's all around you.\" The location was also used to film a scene where Frazier confronts Madeleine White (Jodie Foster). The American Tract Society Building, located at 150 Nassau Street and Spruce Street, Manhattan, doubled as White's office. Cafe Bravo, a coffee shop located at 76 Beaver Street and Hanover Street, was also used for filming. Other filming locations included Battery Park and the New York Supreme Court House's Appellate Division located at East 25th Street and Madison Avenue, Manhattan. Principal photography concluded in August after 43 days of filming."

        "content": "The film was director of photography Matthew Libatique's second collaboration with Lee. Because the filmmakers intended to finish with a digital intermediate (the post-production digital manipulation of color and lighting), Libatique chose to shoot the film in the Super 35 format for a 2.35:1 aspect ratio. He mainly used Kodak Vision2 500T 5218 and Vision2 Expression 500T 5229 film stocks. The film was shot with Arricam and Arriflex cameras and Cooke S4 lenses. Several scenes required multiple-camera setups. Lee wanted to create a visual distinction between the characters Russell (Owen) and Frazier (Washington), while incorporating visual metaphors. Russell's scenes, in which he masterminds the bank heist, were shot with a Steadicam to suggest that the character is in control. Frazier's scenes, in which he is tasked with handling the hostage situation, were filmed with multiple hand-held cameras to display the character's confusion. Libatique explained, \"I said, 'We want to create a sense of control and largely centered frames with Clive's character, and we want to have movement with Denzel's.' Having three operators on the same character, I'd watch all three. In a handheld shot, a long lens has a little bit of movement and a wider lens is inherently smoother. I would actually talk to the operator and tell him not to be so steady. It was the first time I'd worked with so many operators where I wasn't one myself.\" Telephone conversations between Russell and Frazier were shot using two cameras simultaneously filming the actors performing on two different sets of a soundstage at Steiner Studios.  Steadicam operator Stephen Consentino estimated that 80% of the film was shot with hand-held cameras or a Steadicam. A total of seven cameras were used to film the scene where the hostages are finally released. A Technocrane was used for a crane shot that would cover the following moment, in which the hostages are placed in buses. The film features a number of scenes which involve Detectives Frazier and Mitchell (Chiwitel Ejiofor) interrogating several hostages during the aftermath of the heist. Libatique described these scenes as a \"flash-forward\" to events, explaining that Lee \"wanted a look that would jump out and tell you you're somewhere else.\" Libatique photographed the scenes with Kodak Ektachrome 100D 5285 reversal film. Technicolor then cross-processed the filmed footage before it was put through a bleach bypass, which neutralized color temperature and created more contrast. Libatique explained, \"Basically, it unifies all the color ... When you try to apply correction, the film moves in very strange ways.\" Post-production facility EFILM carried out the digital intermediate (DI), with Libatique overseeing the process and working with colorists Steve Bowen and Steve Scott: \"It's difficult to match all of your shots meticulously when you have three cameras and one lighting setup, so I spent the majority of the DI just adhering to the original vision of the disparity in color temperature, which I can accentuate, versus the unified color temperature.\" A majority of Inside Man was scanned on a Northlight film scanner, while the interrogation scenes had to be scanned on a Spirit DataCine, as the negatives proved \"too dense for the Northlight to perform the task.\""

The scene is intercut with a 30-second animated sequence of the fictional game, in which a character performs a drive-by shooting, before killing an intended target with a hand grenade.  Using the Grand Theft Auto franchise as a reference, Lee wanted the scene to serve as a social commentary on gangsta rap, violent crime among African Americans and the rising level of killings in video games. Cinematographer Matthew Libatique enlisted his cousin, Eric Alba, and a team of graphic artists known as House of Pain to design the 30-second animated sequence. Lee asked for the sequence to show two black characters in a ghetto environment dressed in gangster attire. He also gave the artists mockups of two scenarios that ended in homicide\u2014one being a robbery at an ATM, and the other a drive-by shooting. House of Pain spent 10 days working on Gangstas iz Genocide. Alba digitally photographed images of buildings near the Marcy Houses in Brooklyn, New York. Portions of the sequence were pre-visualized in 3D Studio Max, while stills were imported as texture maps and added to animated cut scenes created in 3D modeling package Maya. The artists also improvised the use of a hand grenade. When Lee saw how violent the sequence was, he improvised the line \"Kill Dat Nigga!\" as a subtitle. The entire sequence was rendered out to play onscreen in full frame. The original running time of the animated sequence was 60 seconds. Lee cut it to 30 seconds, feeling that a shorter length would make more of an impact. Upon Inside Mans theatrical release, he remarked that, \"The sad thing is somebody is probably gonna make a game out of it and take that as inspiration.\""

But here it is, a Spike Lee joint that's downright fun.\" Giving the film a B+ rating, Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly described the film as \"a hybrid of studio action pic and Spike Lee joint.

Rex Reed of The New York Observer wrote, \"Inside Man has two things going for it: better actors than usual and a slicker look.

The film takes place in 2027, when two decades of human infertility have left society on the brink of collapse. Asylum seekers seek sanctuary in the United Kingdom, where they are subjected to detention and refoulement by the government. Owen plays civil servant Theo Faron, who must help refugee Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) escape the chaos. Children of Men also stars Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Pam Ferris, and Charlie Hunnam. The film was released on 22 September 2006 in the UK and on 25 December in the US. Critics noted the relationship between the US' Christmas opening and the film's themes of hope, redemption, and faith. Despite the limited release and lack of any clear marketing strategy during awards season by the movie's distributor, Children of Men received critical acclaim and was recognised for its achievements in screenwriting, cinematography, art direction, and innovative single-shot action sequences. It was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Film Editing. It was also nominated for three BAFTA Awards, winning Best Cinematography and Best Production Design, and for three Saturn Awards, winning Best Science Fiction Film.

        "content": "In the year 2027, after 18 years of total human infertility, war and global depression have pushed society to the point of collapse as humanity faces extinction. The United Kingdom, one of the few remaining nations with a functioning government, is deluged by refugees fleeing from the chaos in their own countries. In response to this mass influx, the UK has become a police state as the British Army arrests, imprisons or executes illegal immigrants. Theo Faron, a former activist turned cynical bureaucrat, is kidnapped by the Fishes, a militant immigrant-rights group. They are led by Theo's estranged wife, Julian Taylor, from whom he separated after their son's death during a 2008 flu pandemic. Julian offers Theo money to acquire transit papers for a young refugee named Kee. He obtains the papers from his cousin, a government minister who runs a state-sponsored collection of salvaged art, and agrees to escort Kee in exchange for a larger sum of money. Luke, a Fishes member, drives Theo, Kee, Julian, and former midwife Miriam towards Canterbury, but an armed gang ambushes them, and Julian is killed. Afterwards, two police officers stop their car, but Luke kills them, and the group hides Julian's body before heading to a Fishes safehouse. While there, Kee reveals to Theo that she is pregnant, making her the only pregnant woman on Earth, and that Julian had intended to hand her to the Human Project, a secretive scientific group in the Azores dedicated to curing humanity's infertility. However, Luke persuades Kee to stay, and he is voted as the new leader of the Fishes. That night, Theo eavesdrops on a discussion and learns that Julian's death was orchestrated by the Fishes so that Luke could become their leader, and that they intend to kill Theo and use the baby as a political tool to support the coming revolution. Theo wakes Kee and Miriam, and they steal a car, escaping to the secluded hideaway of Theo's aging friend Jasper Palmer, a former political cartoonist turned pot dealer. The group makes plans to board the Human Project ship, the Tomorrow, which will arrive offshore at Bexhill-on-Sea disguised as a fishing vessel, and Jasper proposes having Syd, an immigration cop to whom he frequently sells drugs, smuggle them into Bexhill as refugees. The next day, when the Fishes discover Jasper's house, the group is forced to flee while Jasper stays behind to stall the Fishes, and he is shot and killed by Luke as Theo watches from the woods. Later, the group meets Syd at an abandoned school, and he helps them board a bus to Bexhill - an entire city converted into a refugee camp. When Kee begins experiencing contractions at a checkpoint, Miriam distracts a guard by feigning religious mania and is taken away. Inside the camp, Theo and Kee meet a Romani woman, Marichka, who provides a room where Kee gives birth to a baby girl. The next day, Syd informs Theo and Kee that war had broken out between the British military and the refugees, led by the Fishes. Having learned that they have a bounty on their heads, Syd attempts to capture them, but Theo kills him with Marichka's help, and they escape. The group then heads to a hidden rowboat amidst the fighting, but the Fishes capture Kee and the baby. Theo manages to track them to an apartment building under heavy fire where he confronts Luke, who is killed in an explosion, and escorts Kee and the baby out. Awed by the baby, the British soldiers and Fishes temporarily stop fighting and allow the trio to leave. Marichka then leads them to the boat but chooses to stay behind as they depart. As British fighter jets conduct airstrikes on Bexhill, Theo and Kee row to the rendezvous point, during which Theo reveals that he was shot and wounded by Luke earlier. He teaches Kee how to burp her baby, prompting Kee to tell Theo that she will name her daughter Dylan after his and Julian's lost son. Theo then loses consciousness and presumably dies as the Tomorrow approaches. As the screen cuts to black, children's laughter is heard."

        "title": "Children of Men_Hope and faith",
        "content": "Children of Men explores the themes of hope and faith in the face of overwhelming futility and despair. The film's source, P. D. James' novel The Children of Men (1992), describes what happens when society is unable to reproduce, using male infertility to explain this problem. In the novel, it is made clear that hope depends on future generations. James writes \"It was reasonable to struggle, to suffer, perhaps even to die, for a more just, a more compassionate society, but not in a world with no future where, all too soon, the very words 'justice', 'compassion', 'society\u2019, 'struggle', 'evil', would be unheard echoes on an empty air.\". The title can therefore be explained as such: children are representing new life, with new chances, choices and possibilities, however with the flip side that they carry the burden of mankind. The film switches the infertility from male to female but never explains its cause: environmental destruction and divine punishment are considered. This unanswered question (and others in the film) have been attributed to Cuar\u00f3n's dislike for expository film: \"There's a kind of cinema I detest, which is a cinema that is about exposition and explanations\u00a0... It's become now what I call a medium for lazy readers\u00a0... Cinema is a hostage of narrative. And I'm very good at narrative as a hostage of cinema.\" Cuar\u00f3n's disdain for back-story and exposition led him to use the concept of female infertility as a \"metaphor for the fading sense of hope\". The \"almost mythical\" Human Project is turned into a \"metaphor for the possibility of the evolution of the human spirit, the evolution of human understanding\". Without dictating how the audience should feel by the end of the film, Cuar\u00f3n encourages viewers to come to their own conclusions about the sense of hope depicted in the final scenes: \"We wanted the end to be a glimpse of a possibility of hope, for the audience to invest their own sense of hope into that ending. So if you're a hopeful person you'll see a lot of hope, and if you're a bleak person you'll see a complete hopelessness at the end.\""

        "content": "Like Virgil's Aeneid, Dante's Divine Comedy, and Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, the crux of the journey in Children of Men lies in what is uncovered along the path rather than the terminus itself. Theo's heroic journey to the south coast mirrors his personal quest for \"self-awareness\", a journey that takes him from \"despair to hope\". According to Cuar\u00f3n, the title of P. D. James' book (The Children of Men) is an allegory derived from a passage of scripture in the Bible. (Psalm 90 (89):3 of the KJV: \"Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men\") James refers to her story as a \"Christian fable\" while Cuar\u00f3n describes it as \"almost like a look at Christianity\": \"I didn't want to shy away from the spiritual archetypes\", Cuar\u00f3n told Filmmaker Magazine. \"But I wasn't interested in dealing with dogma.\" This divergence from the original was criticised by some, including Anthony Sacramone of First Things, who called the film \"an act of vandalism\", noting the irony of how Cuar\u00f3n had removed religion from P.D. James' fable, in which morally sterile nihilism is overcome by Christianity. The film has been noted for its use of Christian symbolism; for example, British terrorists named \"Fishes\" protect the rights of refugees. Opening on Christmas Day in the United States, critics compared the characters of Theo and Kee with Joseph and Mary, calling the film a \"modern-day Nativity story\". Kee's pregnancy is revealed to Theo in a barn, alluding to the manger of the Nativity scene; when Theo asks Kee who the father of the baby is she jokingly states she is a virgin; and when other characters discover Kee and her baby, they respond with \"Jesus Christ\" or the sign of the cross. Also the Archangel Gabriel (among other religious figures) is invoked in the bus scene. To highlight these spiritual themes, Cuar\u00f3n commissioned a 15-minute piece by British composer John Tavener, a member of the Eastern Orthodox Church whose work resonates with the themes of \"motherhood, birth, rebirth, and redemption in the eyes of God\". Calling his score a \"musical and spiritual reaction to Alfonso's film\", snippets of Tavener's \"Fragments of a Prayer\" contain lyrics in Latin, German and Sanskrit sung by mezzo-soprano, Sarah Connolly. Words like \"mata\" (mother), \"pahi mam\" (protect me), \"avatara\" (saviour), and \"alleluia\" appear throughout the film. In the closing credits, the Sanskrit words \"Shantih Shantih Shantih\" appear as end titles. Writer and film critic Laura Eldred of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill observes that Children of Men is \"full of tidbits that call out to the educated viewer\". During a visit to his house by Theo and Kee, Jasper says \"Shanti, shanti, shanti\". Eldred notes that the \"shanti\" used in the film is also found at the end of an Upanishad and in the final line of T. S. Eliot's poem The Waste Land, a work Eldred describes as \"devoted to contemplating a world emptied of fertility: a world on its last, teetering legs\". \"Shanti\" is also a common beginning and ending to all Hindu prayers, and means \"peace\", referencing the invocation of divine intervention and rebirth through an end to violence."

Other popular images appear, such as a sign over the refugee camp reading \"Homeland Security\". The similarity between the hellish, cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 stylized battle scenes of the film and current news and documentary coverage of the Iraq War, is noted by film critic Manohla Dargis, describing Cuar\u00f3n's fictional landscapes as \"war zones of extraordinary plausibility\". In the film, refugees are \"hunted down like cockroaches\", rounded up and put into roofless cages open to the elements and camps, and even shot, leading film critics like Chris Smith and Claudia Puig to observe symbolic \"overtones\" and images of the Holocaust. This is reinforced in the scene where an elderly refugee woman speaking German is seen detained in a cage, and in the scene where British government agents strip and assault refugees; a song by The Libertines, Arbeit macht frei, plays in the background. \"The visual allusions to the Nazi round-ups are unnerving\", writes Richard A. Blake. \"It shows what people can become when the government orchestrates their fears for its own advantage.\" Cuar\u00f3n explains how he uses his imagery to cross-reference fictional and futuristic events with real, contemporary, or historical incidents and beliefs:"

        "content": "The option for the book was first acquired by Beacon Pictures in 1997. The adaptation of the P. D. James novel was originally written by Paul Chart, and later rewritten by Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby. The studio brought director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n on board in 2001. Cuar\u00f3n and screenwriter Timothy J. Sexton began rewriting the script after the director completed Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n. Afraid he would \"start second guessing things\", Cuar\u00f3n chose not to read P. D. James' novel, opting to have Sexton read the book while Cuar\u00f3n himself read an abridged version. Cuar\u00f3n did not immediately begin production, instead directing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. During this period, David Arata rewrote the screenplay and delivered the draft which secured Clive Owen and sent the film into pre-production. The director's work experience in the United Kingdom exposed him to the \"social dynamics of the British psyche\", giving him insight into the depiction of \"British reality\". Cuar\u00f3n used the film The Battle of Algiers as a model for social reconstruction in preparation for production, presenting the film to Clive Owen as an example of his vision for Children of Men. In order to create a philosophical and social framework for the film, the director read literature by Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, as well as similar works. The 1927 film Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans was also influential."

        "content": "A Clockwork Orange was one of the inspirations for the futuristic, yet battered patina of 2027 London. Children of Men was the second film Cuar\u00f3n made in London, with the director portraying the city using single, wide shots. While Cuar\u00f3n was preparing the film, the London bombings occurred, but the director never considered moving the production. \"It would have been impossible to shoot anywhere but London, because of the very obvious way the locations were incorporated into the film\", Cuar\u00f3n told Variety. \"For example, the shot of Fleet Street looking towards St. Paul's would have been impossible to shoot anywhere else.\" Due to these circumstances, the opening terrorist attack scene on Fleet Street was shot a month and a half after the London bombing. Cuar\u00f3n chose to shoot some scenes in East London, a location he considered \"a place without glamour\". The set locations were dressed to make them appear even more run-down; Cuar\u00f3n says he told the crew \"'Let's make it more Mexican'. In other words, we'd look at a location and then say: yes, but in Mexico there would be this and this. It was about making the place look run-down. It was about poverty.\" He also made use of London's most popular sites, shooting in locations like Trafalgar Square and Battersea Power Station. The power station scene (whose conversion into an art archive is a reference to the Tate Modern), has been compared to Antonioni's Red Desert. Cuar\u00f3n added a pig balloon to the scene as homage to Pink Floyd's Animals. Other art works visible in this scene include Michelangelo's David, Picasso's Guernica, and Banksy's British Cops Kissing. London visual effects companies Double Negative and Framestore worked directly with Cuar\u00f3n from script to post production, developing effects and creating \"environments and shots that wouldn't otherwise be possible\". The Historic Dockyard in Chatham was used to film the scene in the empty activist safehouse."

        "title": "Children of Men_Single-shot sequences",
        "content": "Children of Men used several lengthy single-shot sequences in which extremely complex actions take place. The longest of these are a shot in which Kee gives birth (3m19s); an ambush on a country road (4m07s); and a scene in which Theo is captured by the Fishes, escapes, and runs down a street and through a building in the middle of a raging battle (6m18s). These sequences were extremely difficult to film, although the effect of continuity is sometimes an illusion, aided by computer-generated imagery (CGI) effects. Cuar\u00f3n had experimented with long takes in Great Expectations, Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n, and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. His style is influenced by the Swiss film Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000, one of his favourites. He said \"I was studying cinema when I first saw [Jonah], and interested in the French New Wave. Jonah was so unflashy compared with those films. The camera keeps a certain distance and there are relatively few close-ups. It's elegant and flowing, constantly tracking, but very slowly and not calling attention to itself.\" The creation of the single-shot sequences was a challenging, time-consuming process that sparked concerns from the studio. It took fourteen days to prepare for the single shot in which Clive Owen's character searches a building under attack, and five hours for every time they wanted to reshoot it. In the middle of one shot, blood splattered onto the lens, and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki convinced the director to leave it in. According to Owen, \"Right in the thick of it are me and the camera operator because we're doing this very complicated, very specific dance which, when we come to shoot, we have to make feel completely random.\" Cuar\u00f3n's initial idea for maintaining continuity during the roadside ambush scene was dismissed by production experts as an \"impossible shot to do\". Fresh from the visual effects-laden Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Cuar\u00f3n suggested using computer-generated imagery to film the scene. Lubezki refused to allow it, reminding the director that they had intended to make a film akin to a \"raw documentary\". Instead, a special camera rig invented by Gary Thieltges of Doggicam Systems was employed, allowing Cuar\u00f3n to develop the scene as one extended shot. A vehicle was modified to enable seats to tilt and lower actors out of the way of the camera, and the windshield was designed to tilt out of the way to allow camera movement in and out through the front windscreen. A crew of four, including the director of photography and camera operator, rode on the roof. However, the commonly reported statement that the action scenes are continuous shots is not entirely true. Visual effects supervisor Frazer Churchill explains that the effects team had to \"combine several takes to create impossibly long shots\", where their job was to \"create the illusion of a continuous camera move\". Once the team was able to create a \"seamless blend\", they would move on to the next shot. These techniques were important for three continuous shots: the coffee shop explosion in the opening shot, the car ambush, and the battlefield scene. The coffee shop scene was composed of \"two different takes shot over two consecutive days\"; the car ambush was shot in \"six sections and at four different locations over one week and required five seamless digital transitions\"; and the battlefield scene \"was captured in five separate takes over two locations\". Churchill and the Double Negative team created over 160 of these types of effects for the film. In an interview with Variety, Cuar\u00f3n acknowledged this nature of the \"single-shot\" action sequences: \"Maybe I'm spilling a big secret, but sometimes it's more than what it looks like. The important thing is how you blend everything and how you keep the perception of a fluid choreography through all of these different pieces.\" Tim Webber of VFX house Framestore CFC was responsible for the three-and-a-half-minute single take of Kee giving birth, helping to choreograph and create the CG effects of the childbirth. Cuar\u00f3n had originally intended to use an animatronic baby as Kee's child with the exception of the childbirth scene. In the end, two takes were shot, with the second take concealing Clare-Hope Ashitey's legs, replacing them with prosthetic legs. Cuar\u00f3n was pleased with the results of the effect, and returned to previous shots of the baby in animatronic form, replacing them with Framestore's computer-generated baby."

        "content": "Cuar\u00f3n used a combination of rock, pop, electronic music, hip-hop and classical music for the film's soundtrack. Ambient sounds of traffic, barking dogs, and advertisements follow the character of Theo through London, East Sussex and Kent, producing what Los Angeles Times writer Kevin Crust called an \"urban audio rumble\". Crust considered that the music comments indirectly on the barren world of Children of Men: Deep Purple's version of \"Hush\" blaring from Jasper's car radio becomes a \"sly lullaby for a world without babies\" while King Crimson's \"The Court of the Crimson King\" make a similar allusion with their lyrics, \"three lullabies in an ancient tongue\". Amongst a genre-spanning selection of electronic music, a remix of Aphex Twin's \"Omgyjya Switch 7\", which includes the 'Male Thijs Loud Scream' audio sample by Thanvannispen, not present on the original (nor indeed on the official soundtrack) can be heard during the scene in Jasper's house, where Jasper's \"Strawberry Cough\"\u00a0\u2013 a potent strain of cannabis known for its mysterious origins, its aroma of strawberries, and its mood lifting properties\u00a0\u2013 is being sampled. During a conversation between the two men, Radiohead's \"Life in a Glasshouse\" plays in the background. A number of dubstep tracks, including Anti-War Dub by Digital Mystikz, as well as tracks by Kode9 & The Space Ape, Pinch and Pressure are also featured. For the Bexhill scenes during the film's second half, Cuar\u00f3n makes use of silence and cacophonous sound effects such as the firing of automatic weapons and loudspeakers directing the movement of refugee. Classical music by George Frideric Handel, Gustav Mahler, and Krzysztof Penderecki's \"Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima\" complements the chaos of the refugee camp. Throughout the film, John Tavener's Fragments of a Prayer is used as a spiritual motif."

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade \"B-\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars out of four, writing, \"Cuaron fulfills the promise of futuristic fiction; characters do not wear strange costumes or visit the moon, and the cities are not plastic hallucinations, but look just like today, except tired and shabby. Here is certainly a world ending not with a bang but a whimper, and the film serves as a cautionary warning.\" Dana Stevens of Slate called it \"the herald of another blessed event: the arrival of a great director by the name of Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\". Stevens hailed the film's extended car chase and battle scenes as \"two of the most virtuoso single-shot chase sequences I've ever seen\". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called the film a \"superbly directed political thriller\", raining accolades on the long chase scenes. \"Easily one of the best films of the year\" said Ethan Alter of Film Journal International, with scenes that \"dazzle you with their technical complexity and visual virtuosity\".

Film Comment's critics' poll of the best films of 2006 ranked the film number 19, while the 2006 readers' poll ranked it number two. On their list of the best movies of 2006, The A.V.

Peter Travers of Rolling Stone ranked it number two on his list of best films of the decade, writing: According to Metacritic's analysis of the films most often noted on the best-of-the-decade lists, Children of Men is the 11th greatest film of the 2000s. In the wake of the European migrant crisis of 2015, the British withdrawal from the European Union of the late 2010s, the election of Donald Trump in 2016, and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, all of which involved divisive debates about immigration and increasing border enforcement, several commentators reappraised the film's importance, with some calling it \"prescient\"."

She runs to the nearest shelter, Mr. Burns' house, and they hide in the attic. There, Lisa finds a photo of Burns as an employee at Moe's Tavern, and he tells her the origins of it. Burns explains that he and Rich Texan were once involved in a scavenger hunt, with the winner getting all the possessions of the loser. Burns was able to get every item besides one: a picture of himself with a smiling child. The Texan won, and Burns had to get a job at Moe's to regain his fortune. While working, he finds a letter by Moe about his secret treasure. The summer before Edna Krabappel was to begin teaching, she and Moe met and fell in love. Moe wanted to leave Springfield with her but had no money, only for Snake, a polite idealistic archaeologist, to bring a large amount of gold coins he intended to donate to a museum. Moe stole them from Snake, leading him to begin a life of crime. Before Moe and Edna are about to leave, Edna stops by Springfield Elementary School and finds Bart with detention over the summer, claiming he does bad in school because nobody believes in him. Edna tells Moe that she will stay in Springfield to help Bart succeed. Back in the cave, Bart explains that he was lying to distract Edna and help Nelson steal classroom equipment. Moe became depressed and used his coins to play music he and Edna liked on the tavern's jukebox repeatedly. After reading the letter, Burns took the coins from the jukebox and bought his possessions back from the Texan; he complies, but refuses to give the nuclear power plant back until Burns completes the scavenger hunt. The sheep bursts into the attic, and Burns gets hurt defending Lisa. The sheep shows that it found Lisa's pearl necklace and was merely trying to return it. Lisa, in gratitude, takes a photo of her and Burns together, allowing him to get the plant back from the Texan. After Lisa's story, Homer breaks free from the hole. He reveals that he saw the Texan hide the gold coins in the cave, and brought the family there to steal them. Just then, the Texan shows up, and the gold is found. Moe, Burns, and Snake appear, and enter a Mexican standoff. When Marge grabs the bag of coins and drops it into a chasm, everyone realizes how greedy they had been and thank her for getting rid of the gold. The episode is revealed to have been a story by Bart, talking to Principal Skinner as to why he was unable to study for a test. Skinner is unconvinced until he sees Edna making out with Moe outside of the school. When Moe asks Edna why she forgives him, she says that she \"just wants a man with a healthy libido.\" Moe is unable to fulfill this request, and the Texan cheers, \"Moe can't catch a break!\""

Veronica wonders why Lilly didn't tell Veronica about her relationship with Weevil. Veronica meets with Rick in secret, and Rick tells her that a secret society called the Tritons decided to blame her. He is a recent inductee who was trying to get on their good side.

Soon afterwards, Duncan brings Veronica a message from \"The Great Triton,\" and she has to do karaoke onstage in order to elicit a response from the Triton leader. After the song, she meets with the supposed leader, but it is actually an impostor who reveals that a prank has been played on Veronica.

Club praised the episode. \"I'm very happy to see that Veronica Mars is maintaining the comedy/drama mix that it managed to get just right in \"An Echolls Family Christmas\". \u201cClash of the Tritons\u201d isn't quite as great a piece of character work as the Christmas episode, but it's as or more fun.\" However, the reviewer criticized the case-of-the-week. \"The case itself\u2026is a bit of a trifle and the final result ascribes too much forethought to the culprit.\""

Karl attempts to quietly break up with Edie in the same way, but is soon caught in the act when he attempts his escape, as Edie's alarm clock sounds before he can leave the room. Edie wakes up, sees the message and storms outside and sees Karl in his red Ford Mustang in the driveway with all his luggage inside. Karl smiles and hurriedly attempts an escape, but can't drive off because the car won't start. Edie angrily confronts Karl, waving the breakup letter in his face. Karl struggles soothe her anger, but to no avail. Edie then turns around to take a garden rake to try and damage the car. Karl then frantically, finally, gets the Mustang to start before Edie can reach him, but before a smiling Karl can even clear the driveway, he crashes right into a passing garbage truck, which completely damages the entire front end of the Mustang. Smoke comes out of the Mustang. Karl is dejected. Mary Alice, narrating to the audience, muses: \"As he sat there, Karl couldn't help but wonder why God had forsaken him. It never occurred to him that God... might be a woman.\" Edie, satisfied at seeing much more damage to the beloved Mustang than she could inflict by herself, smiles and drops the rake on the front lawn. Later, Edie seeks comfort from the other wives, especially from Susan, whom Karl has also betrayed. Edie then enlists the help of Susan when she has suspicions about who Karl is cheating with. Edie soon takes Susan to a Hooters-type restaurant and accuses a waitress of being slutty. A fight soon ensues and Susan is forced to intervene when Edie is attacked by several waitresses. The following day, Edie thanks Susan for helping her and alerts her that she has hired a detective to learn who Karl has been spending his time with and not to be alarmed. While walking baby Lily one afternoon on Wisteria Lane, Gabrielle and Carlos are approached by Dale, Lily's biological father and brother of Frank who is Libby's ex-boyfriend. Dale walks with the Solises who know why he is there and try to prevent him from taking the baby and creating a scene. Dale tells them that he wants the baby back and that although he is not of legal age, his brother Frank will raise the baby. Gabrielle refuses to take part in this since she legally holds temporary custody of the child. The following day, Gabrielle makes a surprise visit to Dale's school where a pep rally is being held. Gabrielle then quietly pulls Dale aside and asks him to sign the papers or she will embarrass him in front of the entire football team. Dale is not intimidated by Gabrielle's threat and proceeds to sit down. Gabrielle then enters the gymnasium and takes the podium and begins to speak to the students who are far from ecstatic. After much convincing, Dale signs the necessary papers granting Gabrielle and Carlos custody and to continue with the adoption. However, minutes later, police arrive at the Solis home to take baby Lily back. Gabrielle is befuddled since Dale signed away his custodial rights. The police officer then tells him that the biological mother (Libby) changed her mind. Gaby berates Libby that she didn't want the baby, but Libby explains how her and her husband are on their feet and want to try the \"whole family thing\", assuring Gaby she will give them their money back. Gaby tells Libby she doesn't want money but she wants her baby, and pleas with the police officers to no avail. Very emotional, Gaby yells at Libby, who has now taken the baby Lily, that she feeds her and bathes her and rocks her to sleep, and says how Carlos sings to her and says Libby can't take her away because \"we've already fallen in love with her!\". Libby gets in the squad car with Lily and Gabrielle is then forced to be restrained by Carlos when she becomes extremely emotional, kicking and screaming as the car drives off. Bree continues to develop feelings for Peter and attempts to kiss him after an A.A. meeting. They are caught by Peter's sexual addiction sponsor, Claude, who gets upset with Peter and tells him to say goodbye to Bree. Peter does as he is told and leaves with his sponsor. Bree later visits Claude at the doughnut shop where he works and demands that he lay off Peter. Claude tells Bree that he cannot since Peter will regress. Bree gets an idea to bring Peter back when she sees a cocaine addict visit Claude.  Claude chastises him until he hands Claude the cocaine and leaves. Policemen arrive to buy doughnuts and Bree gives them a tip that Claude is in possession of illegal drugs. A few days later, Peter tells Bree that he is shocked to have learned his that his sponsor was found in possession of drugs. Bree then asks Peter if he would like her to be his sponsor. Peter rejects the offer since she does not understand the addiction. Bree then tries to convince him to accept her offer. Peter later calls Bree from a bathroom at a swinger party and asks that she come pick him up. Bree arrives and she is taken into the bathroom and Peter tells her that this is what he used to be like. Bree tries to assure him that she is caring and will help him to the best of her ability. The two then walk out of the bathroom and leave the party. To avoid another late night at the office, Lynette tries to help her boss Ed with his marital woes since he is afraid to go home. Lynette persuades Ed to create an aphrodisiac and set the mood for his wife. While chatting with his wife via an instant message, Ed begins to develop writer's block and asks Lynette to help him. Lynette proceeds to set the mood for Ed and Fran, but the following day Ed reveals to Lynette that they had a horrible evening and his wife found out the messages were not from him. To make things worse, Ed promised to fire the employee who wrote the instant message. Ed promises not to fire Lynette because she is a powerful asset at the firm but begins to find dirt on her husband, Tom, to use him as a scapegoat, much to Lynette's chagrin. Betty Applewhite manages to sell the house without consulting Matthew and warns him that they are leaving. Matthew recommends that instead of moving that they put Caleb away. Betty refuses because Caleb needs his family and that they would be accomplices to his crime. Matthew and Danielle then concoct a scheme to convince Betty to reconsider. One evening, Caleb visits Danielle and attempts to rape her. Bree soon discovers them after hearing Danielle scream and pulls out her gun. Bree then storms into the bedroom and puts Caleb at gunpoint. Danielle asks that Bree not call the police because the Applewhites will also be in trouble. Bree then visits Betty and calls their truce off. Betty agrees and the following morning she and Matthew look at psychiatric facilities. Betty however thinks of a better idea: poisoning Caleb with phenobarbital."

The film stars Arjun, Manisha Koirala and Raghuvaran while Vadivelu and Manivannan appear in supporting roles. The film featured an award-winning soundtrack composed by A. R. Rahman, cinematography by K. V. Anand and dialogues by Sujatha. The film revolves around an ambitious TV journalist, Pughazhendi, who gets his first interview with the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. Pughazh asks harder questions, and the Chief Minister starts trembling and asks him to put his money where his mike is and become his replacement CM for a day. After initially rejecting the offer, Pugazh agrees and does such a great job on his first day, that the actual cabinet collapses and fresh elections are held, where state voters eventually elect him to be their new official Chief Minister. The subsequent unpopularity and jealousy that the old Chief Minister goes through results in him taking revenge on Pugazh, and how he is stopped forms the crux of the story. The film was released on 7 November 1999, as a Deepavali release. The film enjoyed positive critical acclaim and emerged as one of the top grossing Tamil films of 1999. The film ran for over 100 days in theaters and won awards on a regional scale. The film was later remade in Hindi as Nayak (2001). This movie was unofficially remade in Dhallywood (Cinema of Bangladesh) as Minister (2003) and loosely remade in Tollywood (Cinema of West Bengal) as MLA Fatakeshto (2006)."

        "content": "N. Pugazhendi aka Pugazh (Arjun Sarja) is a news reporter working for QTV in Chennai. One day, a riot occurs between the students and the bus drivers in the city following a communal clash which disrupts normal life. The Chief Minister (CM) of the state, Aranganathar (Raghuvaran), informs the police over wireless not to arrest the protesters as they belong to his community and political party. The conversation is recorded by Pugazh in his video camera. Pugazh meets a village girl named Thenmozhi (Manisha Koirala) and falls in love with her. However, her father (Vijayakumar) does not accept the marriage proposal as he wants to get Thenmozhi married only to a government employee. One day, QTV arranges for a live interview with Aranganathar and the anchor in charge left his job and joined at another television channel UTV, a rival for QTV. Pugazh is thrilled and excited as he gets the opportunity to interview the CM. During the course of the interview, Pugazh unmasks many events done by Aranganathar and his party against the welfare of the state, for political reasons with necessary evidences, and he also blames Aranganathar for not taking action while at the riot by evidencing his recorded video taken at the time of the riot. Aranganathar justifies his indifferent stands and challenges Pugazh to accept his post for a day so that he will realize the pressures faced on a daily basis. Pugazh, after a brief trepidation, accepts the challenge provided the constitution permits. Lawmakers confirm that such a provision is possible, and Pugazh is sworn in as the CM for 24 hours. To everyone's surprise, Pugazh does not prefer speaking to the waiting media crew, but he gets into action immediately by collecting a list of irresponsible civil servants and issuing suspension letters immediately. He helps poor people rightfully reclaim houses allotted by the government and requests every Indian citizen to pay all required taxes even if it is for a day, highlighting the effects of avoiding the same. Mayakrishnan (Manivannan), an honest official, is the government secretary and helps Pugazh through his one-day mission. Finally, Pugazh digs a case of corruption against the ruling party leading to the arrest of multiple ex-ministers and even Aranganathar. The same night, Aranganar obtains bail through the attorney general, without even going to Jail. Within minutes of release, he takes Pugazh's success as his defeat and a demean to his long-standing political career, and sends goons to kill Pugazh, who fights off and escapes with minor injuries. Pugal visits Poonjlai and is applauded by the villagers for his actions in the Agri department. He spends his day with Thenmozhi in peace. Meanwhile, Aranganathar's image is tarnished before the public, and all of his coalition parties refuse to support him to become CM again, resulting in dissolution of the legislature, precipitating a General election. Surveys from multiple media indicate enormous public support for Pugazh to become CM, leading to Aranganathar's anger. He uses his clout to get Pugal's house partly demolished.  Mayakrishnan meanwhile goes to Q TV office to convince Pugazh to come to politics. But, Pugazh refuses and states that he is preparing for TNPSC exam. Q TV headquarters is then attacked heavily and pugazh is nearly beaten to death. Next morning, a huge crowd gathers in front of Pugazh's house, requesting him to contest in the upcoming election. All other political parties also come forward to buy his support for their own reasons. However, Pugazh is not for it as he wants to have a safe and secure life. Thenmozhi's father meets him and advises him not to go in politics, while accepting his proposal to Thenmozhi. Mayakrishnan makes him understand how much the people have gathered themselves and shows the plight of people and advises him to sacrifice his comfort zone for the sake of achieving heights in the politics and doing good for the people. Finally, Pugazh accepts it and contests in the ensuing election. His party wins by the vast majority of votes never seen in the political history of Tamil Nadu, and takes all seats in the Legislature. After assuming the office, Pugazh is keen in the state development and gets busy in his schedule of doing welfare to the people, while Aranganathar and other politicians unite as they are worried by the change of events. They hire a hitman to get Pugazh killed, but he escapes with the help of the Z Cadre security guard officials, who shoot the hitman to death. Pugazh, on knowing that Aranganathar is behind this, gets enraged and challenges the latter that the law will not spare him. Aranganathar plans to create a havoc in the rule of Pugazh, and hence, he has his men plant bombs across Chennai. Pugazh and Mayakrishnan get to know of this by a tactful inquiry of Chinnasamy (Cochin Haneefa), who is Aranganathar's right-hand henchman. The bomb squad diffuses all the bombs except one. A bomb planted in Pugazh's house to kill Pugazh, instead claims the lives of his parents. Aranganathar blames Pugazh to be the man behind the entire episode and claims it as a ploy to win public support. Pugazh realizes that he will be prevented from performing his duties and invites Aranganathar to his office. As their conversation progresses, Pugazh pulls out a gun and shoots himself without causing any major injuries. He throws the gun to Aranganathar who catches it out of his reflexes. At the same time, the security guards officials rush in upon hearing gunfire and see Aranganathar pointing the gun at Pugazh. The security guards officials then shoot and kill Aranganathar to save Pugazh. Pugazh feels glad that he can continue his mission without being interrupted, but he also feels guilty for having staged a false incident to kill Aranganathar. He confesses to Mayakrishnan that even he has been forced to play the game of politics. Mayakrishnan supports him by consoling that he played the politics only for a good cause and that Aranganathar deserves this. Thenmozhi's father realizes the greatness of Pugazhendhi and consents to the marriage. The movie ends showing Tamil Nadu as a developed state under the administration of Pugazh with world class infrastructures and free of violence."

The idea for the story was inspired by Indian actor Sivaji Ganesan being named the honorary mayor of Niagara Falls, New York for one day during his visit to the United States. The lead role was initially written with Rajinikanth in mind, but he was unwilling to star in the film. Vijay was also considered by Shankar for the role, though the actor turned the offer down. Shankar revealed that he even approached Kamal Haasan for the film, but he was doing Hey Ram at that time. Arjun, who had previously collaborated with Shankar in Gentleman (1993), was willing to offer bulk schedule dates for the film and was subsequently signed on. Shankar noted that he was interested in casting Meena in the leading role, but he opted against doing so as the actress was working with Arjun in another film in the same period, Rhythm (2000). Subsequently, Manisha Koirala, who worked with Shankar in Indian, was selected to play Arjun's heroine. Raghuvaran was signed to play the chief antagonist in the film, while Vadivelu and Manivannan were also chosen to play other characters. Despite reports that Shilpa Shetty was added to the cast in February 1999, it was later clarified to be untrue. Laila, who had made her acting debut earlier in the year with Kallazhagar, was signed on to portray the role planned with Shetty instead. Originally, her role was supposed to feature throughout the film, but Shankar shortened her character, owing to her call sheet problems. Renowned muralist Natanam and Kalairani were cast as Arjun's parents. S. Sashikanth, who went on to produce films like Thamizh Padam (2010) and Kaaviya Thalaivan (2014), and K. R. Mathivaanan, who directed Aridhu Aridhu (2010), worked as assistant directors. The film was jointly launched by S. Shankar and his co director R. Madhesh in October 1998 at an event attended by actors and technicians from the Tamil film industry, with actors Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan being the special invitees. Production continued for several months, with reports suggesting that the film was delayed due to Manisha Koirala's unavailability though Shankar later stressed the production work demanded such delay. Parts of the film were also shot in Bikaner, Rajasthan while the team also shot extensively in rural Tamil Nadu. The film's cinematographer later noted that the scenes involving crowds shot on Anna Salai, Chennai were among the hardest and most satisfying scenes he had worked on. The song \"Shakalaka Baby\" was the last song to be shot, with Sushmita Sen selected to feature in a special appearance for the song. Stunt master Peter Hein revealed that he worked as a body double for Arjun in the scene where he had to run nude on the streets."

The New Indian Express described the film as \"absorbing\" and praised certain scenes, although it criticized the videos of the songs as a \"fiasco\"."

She gives away a little information about Patsy. At home, she relieves stress with an injection of Chris' heroin. Janice is insinuating herself into Bobby's family life. She freezes out  Mikey Palmice's widow JoJo. She serves the family Carmela's delicious lasagna, claiming it as her own. She urges Bobby to get over his grief\u2014he might lose Junior's support. Bobby pulls himself together and completes a neglected task for Junior: meeting with a union shop steward to intimidate him into changing his vote in an upcoming election. Tony and Carmela are still bitterly divided about money and investment. He refuses to sign the  life insurance trust she proposes, having been advised it is too much in her favor. She receives a stock tip; when he comes up with the money, it is too late. Ralphie's racehorse, \"Pie-O-My,\" wins and he happily shares the winnings with Tony. Next time Tony, who has suggested the race tactics, requires an even bigger share, to Ralphie's chagrin. Tony begins to speak of \"our\" horse; Ralphie is less fond and resents the expense.

It was directed by Fritz Lang and released in 1922. The film is silent and would be followed by the sound sequels The Testament of Dr. Mabuse (1933) and The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse (1960). It is four and a half hours long and divided into two parts, originally released a month apart: Der gro\u00dfe Spieler: Ein Bild der Zeit and Inferno: Ein Spiel von Menschen unserer Zeit. The title, Dr. Mabuse, der Spieler, makes use of three meanings of the German Der Spieler which can mean gambler, puppeteer, or actor. The character Dr. Mabuse, who disguises himself, manipulates people, and is a notorious gambler, embodies all senses of the word. Therefore, the Player might be a more appropriate translation of the title. The film is included in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, being the first of five Lang films to be entered."

        "content": "The Great Gambler: A Picture of the Time (Der gro\u00dfe Spieler: Ein Bild der Zeit) Dr. Mabuse is a criminal mastermind, doctor of psychology, and master of disguise, armed with the powers of hypnosis and mind control, who oversees the counterfeiting and gambling rackets of the Berlin underworld. He visits gambling dens by night under various guises and aliases, using the power of suggestion to win at cards and finance his plans. Among his many henchmen are: Spoerri, his cocaine-addicted manservant; Georg, his chauffeur and sometime assassin; Pesch, an inept goon; Hawasch, who employs a gang of blind men in a counterfeiting operation; Fine, a woman who serves as a lookout; and Folies Berg\u00e8re dancer Cara Carozza, who loves him. As the film opens, Mabuse orchestrates the theft of a commercial contract in order to create a temporary panic in the stock market, which he exploits to make huge profits. Edgar Hull, the son of a millionaire industrialist, becomes Mabuse's next victim. As \"Hugo Balling\", Mabuse gains access to Hull's gentlemen's club and wins a small fortune at cards from the hypnotized Hull, who is made to play badly and recklessly. Afterwards, Hull is unable to account for his behavior. State prosecutor Norbert von Wenk takes an interest in Hull, believing he is the latest in a string of victims similarly tricked by the elusive \"Great Unknown\". Von Wenk goes undercover at a gambling den, where he encounters a disguised Dr. Mabuse. Mabuse attempts to hypnotize von Wenk, but he effectively resists. Mabuse flees. Von Wenk, quickly regaining his faculties, gives chase through the city, but the doctor escapes. Boarding a taxicab driven by Georg, von Wenk is gassed, robbed, and set adrift in a rowboat. Dr. Mabuse realizes that Hull is assisting the state prosecutor, and resolves to eliminate both men. Carozza, who has been romancing Hull on Mabuse's orders, lures the young man to a new illegal casino; when von Wenk calls in the police to raid the place, Carozza, Hull and a police bodyguard exit through the back door, where Georg awaits. He kills Hull, but Carozza is caught and jailed. Von Wenk questions her for information about the \"Great Unknown\", but she refuses to speak. Von Wenk enlists the aid of Countess Told (nicknamed the \"Passive Lady\"), an aristocrat bored by her dull husband and seeking thrills wherever she can find them, to try to get the information by trickery. The Countess is placed in the same cell, an apparent victim of another raid, but Carozza is not fooled. Carozza reveals only her great love for Mabuse, ensuring her silence. The Countess, moved by Carozza's passion, tells von Wenk that she cannot continue to assist him. Dr. Mabuse does nothing to extricate Carozza from jail. He instead attends a s\u00e9ance where he meets Countess Told, who (while under his hypnotic influence) invites him to her house. Once there, Mabuse, taken by the Countess's beauty, decides to display his power by telepathically inducing her husband, Count Told, to cheat at poker. His guests are outraged when they detect it, and the Countess faints. Dr. Mabuse uses the distraction to abduct her and imprison her in his lair."

The Count's condition worsens, and he is tormented by hallucinations. Meanwhile, Carozza is moved to a women's prison and again interrogated by von Wenk. Fearing betrayal, Mabuse sanctions Carozza's death. Georg smuggles poison to her cell, which she takes out of loyalty. Another of Mabuse's henchmen, Pesch, bombs von Wenk's office while posing as an electrician, but von Wenk is unharmed and Pesch detained. Mabuse \u2013 again fearing betrayal \u2013 arranges for Pesch to be killed by a sniper while being transported in a police wagon. Intent on leaving town, Mabuse gives the captive Countess the choice of going with him voluntarily. Her refusal angers him, and Mabuse vows that he will kill the Count. Through his powers of suggestion, he induces the Count to commit suicide with a razor blade. When von Wenk investigates his death, he questions Dr. Mabuse as the Count's psychoanalyst. Dr. Mabuse speculates that the Count had fallen under the control of a hostile will, and asks von Wenk if he is familiar with the experiments of one \"Sandor Weltmann\", who will be performing a public demonstration of telepathy and mass hypnosis at a local theater. Von Wenk and his men attend Weltmann's show. Weltmann is none other than Mabuse in disguise, and his magic show provides him an opportunity to hypnotize von Wenk, who falls into a trance. Mabuse's secret command to von Wenk is to leave the auditorium, get in his car, and drive off a cliff, but von Wenk's men intercede just in time. Coming to his senses, von Wenk orders a siege of Mabuse's house. Dr. Mabuse and his men make a final stand. In the ensuing gunfight, Hawasch and Fine are killed, Spoerri and Georg are taken into custody, and the Countess is rescued. Dr. Mabuse flees through an underground sewer to Hawasch's counterfeiting workshop, where he becomes trapped, as the doors cannot be opened from the inside. There, Mabuse is confronted by the ghosts of his victims and various demonic illusions. Spoerri, under interrogation, identifies a key found at Mabuse's mansion as being for the workshop. Von Wenk and the police break in and take the now-insane Dr. Mabuse away."

        "content": "Production of the first part of Dr. Mabuse the Gambler began while the novel on which it is based, Norbert Jacques' Dr. Mabuse, der Spieler was still being serialized.  The film made a number of important changes from the book version.  In the book the characters engage in constant soliloquies which would not have adapted well to film, particularly a silent film which would have required many intertitles to make that work.  The film also eliminated a subplot in which Mabuse's actions are shown to be motivated by a desire to create his own country within South America.  Film historian David Kalat points out that by eliminating reference to Mabuse's motivation Lang starts to dehumanize the character, which helped lead to the character becoming a franchise.  But Kalat also notes that this eliminates the irony of the fact that Mabuse was seen by many viewers as a representation of aspects of Adolf Hitler, and many Nazis actually fled to South America after World War II. Lang and von Harbou also added some elements to the film that were not in the novel.  One of Mabuse's key skills in the film is as a counterfeiter, but in the novel he never engaged in this.  Mabuse's role in counterfeiting money adds to the social subtext and to the themes of the film.  The film's opening, a 20-minute tour de force introducing the myth of Mabuse, was also not in the novel.  The introduction starts with Mabuse shuffling a deck of photos like playing cards which will determine which disguise he will use that day and culminates with Mabuse manipulating a stock market crash.  Kalat traces the inspiration for this sequence to Louis Feuillade's 1913 Fant\u00f4mas II: Juve contre Fant\u00f4mas (Juve vs. Fant\u00f4mas).  The ending to the second part of Dr. Mabuse is also unique to the film. The film incorporates a number of special effects such as animation and superimpositions.  One aspect that was cheered upon the film's original release was the nighttime scene of the automobile chase in which Wenk chases Mabuse, which David Kalat called the most successful execution of such nighttime photography to that time. It was during the production of this film that Lang and von Harbou began their affair which would ultimately result in their marriage.  Although von Harbou was married to Klein-Rogge at the time, their separation was amicable and did not create a problem for the film."

        "title": "Dr. Mabuse the Gambler_Themes",
        "content": "A key theme of the film is the dissolution of German society after World War I.  The film portrays but exaggerates the difficult conditions during the period making the film's world a dystopia.  The worthless counterfeit money created by Mabuse reflects the nearly worthless Deutsche Mark during the hyperinflation resulting from the Weimar Republic printing excessive money to pay war reparations.  The stock market swings, gambling parlors and miserable living conditions for poor people depicted in the film were also reflections of conditions in Germany at the time. The character of Dr. Mabuse can also be seen as depiction of \"the power of evil or a distorted inner psyche\".  Lang scholar Paul Jensen interpreted Mabuse as \"a symbol to unite all the negative factors in Germany at the time\".  The film depicts difficult problems such as rampant crime, worthless money and a volatile stock market as thus being under the control of a single man.   Bernd Widdig points out that while Dr. Mabuse is not an anti-Semitic film, aspects of Mabuse's character may have reflected contemporary stereotypes of Jews, especially since he acts in stereotypically Jewish roles such as psychoanalyst, banker, peddler and revolutionary, and consistent with the views on Jews of some contemporary Germans his manipulations were responsible for problems in society.  A contemporary Nazi critic wrote that Mabuse is \"a quintessential Jewish figure\" who goes through time with the singular goal of \"mastery of the world\" regardless of the consequences to others and whose descent into insanity caused his crimes to go unpunished in what the Nazi critic described as \"the typical case of the Jewish criminal\".  On the other hand, Mabuse with his hypnotic power over the masses in pursuit of evil has also been seen as a foreshadowing of Adolf Hitler.  In the sequel The Testament of Dr. Mabuse the link between the Mabuse character and the Nazis is made stronger.  Lang stated that he viewed Mabuse as a Nietzschean \u00dcbermensch.  Lang also saw Mabuse's character as emblematic of a certain kind of money-accumulator in Weimar Germany referred to as a \"Raffke\".  The producer of Dr. Mabuse, Erich Pommer, saw the film as a depiction of the contemporary conflict between the liberal conservatives and the Marxist Spartacists in which the Mabuse character represented the Spartacists.  Yet another view saw populist themes in the film. Another theme in the film is surveillance and seeing without being seen.  Yet another theme is that of being versus seeming, portrayed through Mabuse's disguises and through buildings whose interiors seem inconsistent with their exteriors."

It went on to state that it \"will give people fifty or one hundred years from now an idea of an age that they could hardly comprehend without such a document.\"  Film-Kurier praised Klein-Rogge's \"brilliant performance\" and Lang's \"sensitive yet experienced\" direction. When the film was released in the United States in 1927 in a single film that was less than half the length of the original 2-part version, The New York Times criticized it for being too long and for the \"hyperbolic overacting\".  But when the full length version finally was released in the United States at the 1973 New York Film Festival, Times critic Nora Sayre praised it as being \"something very good\" and \"possibly the hit of the festival\". Variety praised the film's plot for its \"speed and life\" while acknowledging that it can be confusing.  Variety felt the best parts of the movie were the scenes between Mabuse and Von Wenk.  Variety praised several of the acting performances but felt Klein-Rogge was too small to be fully effective in the role, and praised some of Lang's technical effects while criticizing the overlong intertitles. Time Out criticized the film for its \"disorganised and erratically paced\" narrative and \"shaky\" grasp of social reality but praised its \"flashes of inspiration\".  Entertainment Weekly reviewer Tim Purtell rated the film an A-, comparing the titular villain to those in the James Bond and Mission Impossible movies.  Purtell particularly praised the \"sharp\" plot turns, \"stunning visuals\" and Klein-Rogge's performance.

The short then focuses to the present day and reveals the pigs now play modern instruments and perform as The Three Little Bops. During a gig at the House of Straw, the Big Bad Wolf appears and proves he is friendly by stating that he wants to sit in with the band. The Wolf happens to be terrible at playing his choice of instrument (a trumpet) so the pigs throw him out. Feeling insulted, the Wolf retaliates by blowing down the straw house using his trumpet, forcing the pigs to go to the Dew Drop Inn, the House of Sticks. Things go well (including the piano playing pig doing an imitation of Liberace's \"I wish my brother George was here\"), until the Wolf comes in and attempts to play his trumpet again. Like the pigs, the people watching also think the wolf's playing is corny, so they call for the pigs to \"throw the square out\", which they do. Again, the Wolf retaliates by blowing down the Dew Drop Inn. The pigs then realize that to escape the Wolf's \"windy tricks,\" they will go to the House of Bricks (built on May 1, 1776, according to a cornerstone). The House of Bricks has a \"No Wolves Allowed\" rule, so when the Wolf tries to get in, he is punched in the face by a bouncer. Then he tries to ram the door down with a log but with no success. The Wolf runs out of breath in trying to blow away the club, but thinks he can get in by disguising himself. He reenters in fur coat and ukulele with his perfect rendition of the Charleston song (cut short by slipping on a strategically thrown banana peel). He returns in the disguise of a houseplant with his trumpet but gets blasted outside by a plunger shot from the double bass. For his third try, the Wolf shows up in a drum major outfit playing a big bass drum to the tune of \"Don't Give Up the Ship\". A dart is shot into the drum to deflate it, leaving him to exit in humiliation before the pigs shut and lock the door to ensure he can't get in again. Not the least bit deterred, he shows up with a large cylinder of TNT and snaps, \"I'll show those pigs that I'm not stuck!  If I can't blow it down, I'll blow it up!\"  The fuse is blown out on his first try, so he steps back a bit and lights it from there.  Unfortunately for him, he is too far away and his weapon explodes while he is carrying it to his target, killing the Big Bad Wolf. The narrator reveals that the explosion did not send the Wolf to Heaven but down to \"the other place\", where his trumpet playing improves.  When the pigs hear this, one of them says, \"The Big Bad Wolf, he learned the rule: you gotta get hot to play real cool!\"  The Wolf's spirit then rises up through the floor and, now playing expertly, joins in for the final notes prompting one of the pigs to alter their band's name to \"The Three Little Bops Plus One\"."

It introduced the melody of the song \"Strangers in the Night\", which was initially to be sung by Melina Mercouri, but she insisted that her voice would not fit to the melody and it should be given to a man. Eventually, the version by Frank Sinatra became a global number one hit and by now is considered a standard of easy listening music. The tune, listed in the original sound track as \"Beddy Bye\", permeates the movie and won the Golden Globe Award for \"Best Original Song in a Motion Picture\" of 1967, beating the other nominated compositions \"Un homme et une femme\" by French orchestra leader Francis Lai, \"Born Free\" by John Barry, which won the 1966 Academy Award for Best Original Song, \"Alfie\" by Burt Bacharach, and  \"Georgy Girl\" by Tom Springfield, from the eponymous movies, the latter two also having been Oscar nominees in 1966. The overall score to the movie, often resorting to Latin and even seemingly Greek influenced imagery, had a more mixed reception. The soundtrack LP - in fact a rerecording of the score - was produced by Milt Gabler and recorded at Polydor Studios, Hamburg, Germany. It was originally released on a LP by Decca (Decca DL 74750) and on a CD in 1999 by Taragon Records, then combined with Bert Kaempfert's LP Strangers in the Night (original release 1966, Decca DL 74795)."

Secured to a table is Dr. Cameron's simpleminded but strong gardener, Petro (Glenn Strange), who is to be the subject of the doctor's experiment. Cameron injects a serum made from a wolf's blood into the cooperative Petro, who loses consciousness, grows fur and fangs, and awakens after he has transformed into a wolfman. Cameron turns to an empty table, visualizing his former colleagues sitting there: The four professors dismissed his theory that wolf blood transfusions could be used to give a human being wolf-like traits. He recalls how the scientific community, the press, and the public joined in a resounding chorus of ridicule that finally cost him his position at the university. Addressing the four spectral professors, Cameron declares, \"Right now, we're at war, at war with an enemy that produces a horde that strikes with a ferocious fanaticism\". Cameron proposes giving wolfman traits to soldiers in order to help win the war. When the professors scoff, Cameron says to them that his proposal doesn't really matter; he is going to have his wolfman kill them one-by-one. For the time being, however, he administers an antidote that transforms Petro back to normal; Petro remembers nothing. The following night, Cameron injects Petro again and sends him into the swamp. As a wolfman, he enters a nearby home and kills a little girl. Hearing about the child's death, Cameron knows his formulation works. Now he can proceed to eliminate his former colleagues. He begins by setting up elaborate encounters in which Petro, left alone with each scientist, makes his wolfman transformation. The more times this happens, however, the more unpredictable Petro becomes while killing them. Cameron's daughter Lenora (Anne Nagel) is romantically involved with Tom Gregory (Johnny Downs), a newspaper reporter investigating the death of the little girl. As the professors are killed, Gregory begins to suspect that Cameron is behind the murders. The principals arrive at the Cameron home as a large thunderstorm begins. A bolt of lightning suddenly strikes, setting Cameron's laboratory on fire. Lenora and Tom are able escape from the spreading fire after first encountering an agitated Petro, now in his wolfman form. The transformed Petro suddenly turns on Cameron and kills him, as the raging fire brings down the house on both of them."

It was the first gay porn film to include credits and to be reviewed by the film industry journal Variety, and one of the earliest porn films \u2013 after Andy Warhol's 1969 film Blue Movie,  but preceding 1972's Deep Throat  \u2013 to gain mainstream credibility. Produced on a budget of about $8,000, the film collects three segments depicting Donovan's sexual adventures at a gay beach resort. Promoted by Poole with an advertising campaign unprecedented for a pornographic feature, it premiered in 1971 at the 253-seat 55th Street Playhouse in Manhattan, where it was an immediate critical and commercial success. The film brought Donovan international recognition. A sequel Boys in the Sand II was eventually released in 1986, but in the much-changed film and porn markets did not match the success of the original. The film's title is a parodic reference to the 1968 Mart Crowley play The Boys in the Band, which had been adapted into a 1970 film of the same name."

He strips and sits on blanket, watching the sea intently. Suddenly, out in the water, blond naked Donovan appears and runs up onto the beach to Fisk. Fisk performs oral sex on Donovan, who then leads Fisk into the woods. Fisk grabs the blanket and follows, catching up to Donovan in a clearing. They kiss and touch each other, then Donovan takes a studded leather strap from Fisk's wrist and attaches it around Fisk's genitalia. They continue the scene, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Fisk. Following Donovan's climax he returns to servicing Fisk orally and, as Fisk is climaxing, momentary flashes of previous scenes are intercut. The scene ends with Fisk taking the strap from his genitals and attaching it around Donovan's wrist. Fisk runs into the ocean and vanishes, mirroring Donovan's entrance. Donovan dons Fisk's abandoned clothes and heads off down the beach. Poolside: The segment opens with Donovan on a pier, holding a newspaper. He returns to his house, strips by the pool and begins reading. Intrigued by an ad in the back of the paper, Donovan writes a letter in response. After a number of days pass (marked by fluttering calendar pages), he receives a reply in the form of a package. Inside is a tablet, which he throws into the pool. The water starts to churn and dark-haired Danny Di Cioccio emerges to Donovan's delight. The two couple by the pool, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Di Cioccio in a variety of positions. Di Cioccio turns the tables and tops Donovan until Donovan's climax. The scene closes with the two engaged in horseplay in the pool and then walking off together down a boardwalk. Inside: This final segment opens with shots of Donovan showering, toweling off and wandering idly around his room, intercut with shots of African-American telephone repairman Tommy Moore checking various poles and lines outside. Donovan spots Moore from his balcony, and Moore sees Donovan as well. The remainder of the segment consists of Donovan's fantasized sexual encounters with Moore throughout the house intercut with shots of Donovan sniffing poppers and penetrating himself with a large black dildo. The segment ends following Donovan's climax with the dildo, with the real Moore coming inside the house and closing the door behind them."

After watching the film, he said to a friend, \"This is the worst, ugliest movie I've ever seen! Somebody oughta be able to do something better than this.\" Poole was convinced that he was that somebody; \"I wanted [to make] a film that gay people could look at and say, 'I don't mind being gay - it's beautiful to see those people do what they're doing.'\" Having enlisted the help of his lover Peter Fisk and another man, Poole first shot a 10-minute segment titled Bayside. The success of that initial shoot convinced Poole to plan two more segments and seek theatrical distribution for the completed work. He hired Tommy Moore and Casey Donovan for the third segment, Inside. When Fisk's scene partner from Bayside heard about the potential distribution deal, he refused to sign release forms until he was guaranteed 20% of the profits. Instead, Poole decided to scrap the segment and re-shoot with Fisk and Donovan. The resulting footage was so good that Poole decided to use Donovan for the second segment as well, titled Poolside, and he constructed the loose storyline around him. The three segments were filmed on a budget of $8,000 over three successive weekends in August 1971 in the gay resort area of Cherry Grove, New York."

Poole engaged in an unprecedented pre-release publicity campaign, including screening parties and full-page ads in The New York Times and Variety. The line, for the first showing, reached 7th Avenue. The film made back most of its production and promotions budget the day it opened, grossing close to $6,000 in the first hour, and nearly $25,000 during its first week, landing it on Variety's list of the week's 50 top-grossing films. Positive word of mouth spread and the film was favorably reviewed in Variety (\"There are no more closets!\"), The Advocate (\"Everyone will fall in love with this philandering fellator\"), and other outlets, which previously had completely ignored the genre. While some critics were less impressed, others saw the film as akin to the avant-garde work of directors like Kenneth Anger and Andy Warhol. Within six months the film had grossed $140,000 and was continuing to open in theatres across the United States and around the world. The film's mainstream popularity helped usher in the era of \"porno chic,\" a brief period of mainstream cultural acceptability afforded hardcore pornographic film, having been cited as \"very much a precursor\" to the following year's crossover success of Deep Throat. The film attracted critical and scholarly attention from pornography historians and researchers for years after its release. The film is credited with beginning the trend of giving pornographic films titles that spoof the names of non-porn films. With the success of Boys in the Sand, Casey Donovan became an underground celebrity. While he never achieved the mainstream film career for which he had hoped, he continued his career in pornography and translated his fame into some appearances on the legitimate stage, including a successful national tour in the gay-themed play Tubstrip and an unsuccessful attempt to produce a revival of The Ritz. His fame also allowed him success as a high-priced prostitute. He remained a bankable commodity in the adult industry, making films for the next 15 years until his death from AIDS-related illness in 1987."

The original opening sequence, Bayside, was recreated for the sequel, with Pat Allen performing the run from the water. Litigation tied up the release of Boys in the Sand II until 1986 and with the advent of the home video market, there was a glut of gay porn titles available. Boys in the Sand II did not distinguish itself from the competition and was not particularly successful. In 2002, TLA Releasing released The Wakefield Poole Collection. The two-DVD set includes Boys in the Sand and Boys in the Sand II along with Bijou (1972), a third Poole/Donovan collaboration, and other shorts and material shot by Poole. The collection won a 2003 GayVN Award for Best Classic Gay DVD. In May 2014, filmmaker and writer Jim Tushinski's full-length documentary I Always Said Yes: The Many Lives of Wakefield Poole, which features extensive interviews with Poole, producer Marvin Schulman, and many contemporaries, began playing at film festivals.

Subba Rao's three novels Nagarahavu, Ondu Gandu Eradu Hennu and Sarpa Mathsara, and starring Vishnuvardhan, Aarathi , K. S. Ashwath and Shubha. The supporting cast features Leelavathi, Ambareesh, Shivaram, Dheerendra Gopal, Lokanath and Vajramuni. This film was remade in Hindi as Zehreela Insaan, directed by Puttanna Kanagal himself and  in Tamil as Raja Nagam and Kode Nagu in Telugu. The film was a huge success and paved way for the stardom of Vishnuvardhan, Ambarish and Aarathi who eventually morphed as leading actors in Kannada cinema. This was Vishnuvardhan's first movie as the lead. Over a period of time, the character roles of Leelavathi, Dheerendra Gopal, Loknath, M. N. Lakshmi Devi have come in for their share of applause. The film primarily revolves around the protagonist's relationship with his teacher, Chamayya (K. S. Ashwath). Chamayya, who is childless treats Ramachari (Vishnuvardhan) as his son. He takes it upon himself to guide Ramachari on the right path despite Ramachari's legendary anger. He usually acts as the negotiator between his student and the people who have issues with Ramachari's behaviour.  Ramachari is a young man whose anger is his weakness. He is difficult to reason with and has a great deal of pride. Chamayya is the only person who can convince him to do anything. His love interests are Alamelu (Aarathi) and Margaret (Shubha) who play pivotal parts in his life. The film was re-released in its digitized version on July 20, 2018.  This movie was digitalized by Balaji who is the brother of V.Ravichandran and son of Veeraswammy who was the producer. The re-release got a huge appreciation from all and created a new record of collection."

The story begins with Ramachari being caught in class while trying to copy in an examination and getting suspended by the college principal (Loknath). Humiliated and angry, Ramachari throws stones at the principal's house in the night and when the principal wakes up and comes out of his house, ties the half-naked principal to a pole and runs away. Ramachari is the son of pious parents. His father doesn't like Ramachari because he is unpopular in the town as a ruffian. His mother is worried about his future. One person who  cares for Ramachari is his primary school teacher, Chamayya (K.S.Ashwath) master. Ramachari finds the company of Chamayya and his wife Tunga (Leelavathi), more comforting than that of his parents. Ramachari has very great regard for Chamayya master willing to do whatever he says, without thinking. The next part of the story is about the two women Almelu (Aarathi) and Margaret (Shubha) who come into Ramachari's life and how the teacher Chamayya influences Ramachari's decisions in these relationships. The teacher tries to bring Ramachari into the \"conventional way of life\", but he errs and Ramachari's life is destroyed."

When Almelu refuses the proposal and declares her love for Ramachari, Varada refuses support, denying he ever madea ny promise to Ramachari. Teacher Chamayya intervenes and requests Ramachari to give up Almelu. He convinces Ramachari by making him understand that sacrifice is a greater act than selfish love. Ramachari, out of respect,  agrees to his teacher and sacrifices his love. A few years later, Ramachari runs into Almelu at a five-star hotel, where she is a call-girl. Almelu's husband has forced her into a life of prostitution for money."

However, due to the intense pressure of the society which denounces the marriage between a Brahmin boy and a Christian girl, they decide to run away. Once again teacher Chamayya tries to stop Ramachari saying that by sacrificing his love for Margaret, he will be upholding his religion and tradition. But this time, Ramachari confronts his teacher and says that he won't budge because the last time he sacrificed his love for Almelu, it went horribly wrong, as Almelu is now a high society call girl. Chamayya realizes perhaps for the first time that Ramachari is right and he himself was wrong."

They also play married each other with ring pops. Five years later, Norbit is rescued from playground bullies by a tough, overweight girl Rasputia Latimore, who becomes his protector from the other bullies and best friend, but eventually grows into an arrogant and tyrannical woman. After a while, they get married and Rasputia begins insulting and controlling him. Norbit is also belittled by Rasputia's older brothers Big Black Jack, Blue, and Earl, working as a bookkeeper at their construction company. The Latimore brothers run a \"security business\", instilling fear in the entire community except Mr. Wong, who refuses to sell them his business. Norbit catches Rasputia cheating on him with her dance instructor Buster Perkin, throws away his wedding ring and vents his anger at a puppet show for the orphans. He is stunned to see Kate for the first time since childhood, and his affection for her reignites as he learns she is buying Mr. Wong's orphanage, but is disappointed to learn she is engaged to a man named Deion Hughes. With help from ex-pimp friends Pope Sweet Jesus and Lord Have Mercy and other townspeople, Norbit meets Kate without Rasputia's knowledge. Deion attempts to leave town without Kate, having no intention to help her run the orphanage, but  the Latimore brothers stop and persuade him to instead help them to turn the orphanage into a strip club. The brothers dupe Norbit into getting Kate to sign papers to renew the restaurant's liquor license in the Latimores' name. Norbit's meeting with Kate leads to helping rehearse her wedding, where a kiss between them makes her reconsider marrying Deion. Norbit returns home to learn Rasputia witnessed their kiss and threatens violence towards Kate if he ever sees her again. When Kate later learns about the deal from Deion, she goes to confront Norbit and sees him being held prisoner by Rasputia (who masterminded the orphanage plot) in their basement. Norbit reluctantly, deliberately drives her away to protect her from Rasputia. Satisfied, Rasputia lies that Norbit has tricked Kate since she came back to town. Heartbroken, Kate runs away, and Norbit decides to permanently leave town. Then he finds a letter from the private investigator he hired, discovering Deion is rich from various divorce settlements. The Latimores reveal their plan to Norbit, and lock him in the basement again. Norbit escapes, reaching the wedding just in time to inform Kate of Deion's schemes. Though his proof of Deion's divorce settlements was destroyed after falling into a pond, Norbit reveals Deion's ex-wives and children, and Deion flees as they give chase. The Latimores attack Norbit for ruining their plans, but the townspeople take up arms to protect him. Rasputia fights her way through the crowd and prepares to kill him, but Mr. Wong harpoons her in the rear. The Latimores are chased out of town, and Norbit and Kate reconcile. They buy the orphanage and marry under the same tree where they played as children. The Latimores move to Mexico and open up their strip club \"El Nipplopolis\", where Rasputia becomes their most popular and lucrative stripper."

        "content": "After the success of Shrek, DreamWorks co-founder and CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg signed up Eddie Murphy to star in a live-action followup, and they were looking for the right film. Norbit seemed like a good fit, following on from playing multiple characters in a family comedy as Murphy had done before with Dr. Dolittle and The Nutty Professor. DreamWorks production president Adam Goodman brought the script to Brian Robbins and he was excited about the prospect of working with Eddie Murphy. Norbit was the first of three films where director Brian Robbins and Eddie Murphy worked together. They later collaborated for Meet Dave and A Thousand Words. The various prosthetic makeups, bodysuits, and wigs were created by Rick Baker and his company Cinovation. Baker praised Murphy saying \"He really makes the stuff come to life, and he never complains. When we did 'The Nutty Professor' [...], he spent 80-odd days in the makeup chair. As much as I love makeup, even I would have been complaining by the end, but Eddie didn't.\" Rick Baker wanted to work from a real life model and auditioned over a hundred extra large ladies, all with the necessary proportions. The model also needed to be able to dance. After several rounds of auditions, one lady was chosen as the life model for Rasputia and a foam latex suit was created based on her measurements. The surfaces was painted with silicone to make it look like skin. Silicone was also used to make matching gloves. The shape of Murphy's face was changed using foam latex and pieces of silicone, which were then painted over in various tones of red, brown and yellow to create realistic looking skin tone. A body double was used for some scenes, particularly the water park. Murphy with his face in makeup as Rasputia performed against green screen and his was head was digitally composited onto the body double."

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a B grade, with under eighteens (28% of those surveyed) giving it a B+ grade. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the movie a positive review, suggesting that Norbit might help Murphy's chances of winning an Oscar for his role in Dreamgirls, saying that his work playing three distinct characters in Norbit is more impressive than anything he did in Dreamgirls. Others suggested it might hurt his chances. Ultimately, Alan Arkin won the award for Best Supporting Actor. Luke Sader of The Hollywood Reporter called it \"Racially insensitive, politically incorrect and beyond crude.\" Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club gave the film a grade of \"F\" and wrote: \"It probably isn't possible for a single movie to reverse all social progress made since the civil-rights era, but Norbit, the latest broadside from Eddie Murphy, does its best to turn back the clock\" and \"hideously offensive black stereotypes are merely the tip of the iceberg.\" Josh Tyler of Cinemablend.com gave the movie a mostly negative review, in which he described parts of the film as \"pretty despicable\" and stated that \"the plot relies on the idea that being fat also means you're a horrible bitch.\" However, he pointed out that \"some of it's also kind of sweet. Eddie's really quite good as Norbit, the character is sympathetic and funny. He has a strange sort of perfect chemistry with Thandie Newton, and that's just not something I would have expected.\" Liz Braun of Jam! Movies described Norbit as \"mostly blubber jokes about how fat Rasputia really is\" but said that \"the movie is not without genuine laughs. Most of those laughs are generated by the other actors.\" In regard to the \"terrifying\" character Rasputia, she went so far as to say that the film \"tends to confirm one's worst suspicions about Murphy and what appears to be his general fear and loathing of women. The Rasputia gag gets a little freaky if you think about it too much. And you wouldn't want to dwell on how much Thandie Newton looks like a slender boy in her role as Norbit's true love, either. So don't.\" Black activists took issue with Eddie Murphy's portrayal of the character Rasputia, calling Norbit \"just the latest [film built] around a black man dressing up as an unsophisticated, overweight black woman.\" Film critic MaryAnn Johanson said it was a minstrel show and called it a \"hideous stew of bigoted \"humor\"\". The New Yorker film critic Richard Brody praised Murphy's performances saying \"playing multiple roles, Murphy unleashes, with a sense of painful revelation, a tangle of rage, cringing fear, furious power, and a sense of perpetual and unresolved outsiderness.\" He rated it 17th of 30 top acting performances of the 21st century. Musician Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys called Norbit his favourite movie in a 2007 interview with the Asbury Park Press."

I don't think so.\" He also claimed \"The only films that get good reviews are the ones that nobody sees. I just don't think you can make movies for critics\". Robbins defended his star-driven, high-concept movies approach to filmmaking saying: \"Don't pay attention to tracking, and don't read the reviews ... Funny trumps. Work with movie stars.\" Jim Emerson of RogerEbert.com agreed that filmmakers like Robbins should ignore critics and made note of the ancient analogy about McDonald's and food critics. He suggested that Robbins films \"were neither designed for, nor marketed to, people who pay all that much attention to movie critics\".

In real life the Marquis de Sade's body was exhumed from its grave in the grounds of the lunatic asylum at Charenton, where he died in 1814, and his skull was removed for phrenological analysis.

Therefore, Ramji plans to go to London and work as a cook  for a multi-millionaire dollar London-based Indian businessman-family. The arrangement is that Ramji  will have to send  part of his salary as a compensation for the dowry he owes. Unfortunately on the day Ramji arrives at the employer's door-step, the millionaire who hired him is very sick, and eventually passes away before signing Ramji's paperwork- leaving him jobless.

Eventually, due to his good manners, friendliness and expert skills he wins the family's heart. As the restaurant becomes lucrative due to Ramji's excellent culinary skills, the police are on his heels. Jai Kapoor, Guru's cunning lawyer friend, explains that the only way out is marriage with a British citizen, and suggests Ramji to marry his own girlfriend Samira. Guru also convinces Ramji to do 'marriage of convenience' so that he can win this case against the police who have filed a case against his restaurant business (hiring illegal immigrants). Ramji reluctantly agrees for a \"fake\" marriage with Jai's girlfriend Samira, and they get married over the weekend inside a church (so that paperwork comes faster). For all these gimmicks, the lawyer charges heavy fees from Mr. Guru and deposits them in the joint account of his with Samira. The police become more and more suspicious that this is a fake marriage and refer the matter to the consulate. The embassy invites both Ramji and Samira for interview for which they start preparing by getting to know each other better. By this time, Ramji finds out more about the cunning shrewd character of Jai (the lawyer) in a chance meeting at the bus stop with Jai's ex -wife. The lady explains how Jai had promised her so many things and then suddenly deserted her and her son- for which she will seek revenge on him for abandoning his family. Ramji explains this all to Samira and Samira also meets with Jai's ex-wife. In the meantime, constant stalking by the police forces Samira and Ramji to stay/live  together to avoid detection by authority. Samira is deeply troubled with rural mannerisms of Ramji. To break the ice, Ramji cooks delicacies for Samira and wins her heart. Gradually, Samira also  realises that Jai is merely fooling around with her life and doesn't really love her. Meanwhile, Ramji is not able to send the dowry installments as promised and his sister's in-laws throw her out of the house. Ramji's sister desperately calls Ramji and Samira answers the call and handles the situation by sending all the money received for the fake marriage in her and Jai's joint account to her and makes sure her long-time friend is taken care of. Unfortunately, in their final interview with the consulate, Ramji answers more than he is asked at the immigration office then is forced to return to India ( due to being illegal worker). However, as  Ramji is preparing to be deported a good news comes; Ramji wins a cooking competition (which Samira had enlisted him for) and thus, wins more money and employment opportunities at Ritz Hotel. Ramji replies to Samira that he will use his \u00a350,000 competition money to build an English school in his village so no one will be illiterate. Samiras granny gives her passport and a ticket so she can join ramji. After 10 months his restaurant is ready in India and his sister has had a baby. In the meantime, they are all waiting for a mystery guest to inaugurate the restaurant. This turns out to be Amitabh Bacchan and the movie ends with him cutting the ribbon."

Madhavan chose to rewrite the second half of the original film and change the climax to his preference. Actress Samita Bangargi was cast in the film after Madhavan's wife Sarita had recommended her after seeing her work in Yeh Kya Ho Raha Hai? (2002) and in the promotional videos of Shaadi Ka Laddoo (2004). She was cast in the film as a non-resident Indian from London. The film was primarily shot throughout 2004 in London and Reading The shoot occurred swiftly, with a particular set of 20 minutes of screen time being shot in six hours. As a result of the 2004 Madrid train bombings, the team found it difficult to gain permission to shoot the film at an airport. Eventually after failing to convince officials at Heathrow Airport and Gatwick Airport, they had to settle for filming a sequence at Leicester Airport."

Critic Baradwaj Rangan wrote, \"This may be the story of a cook, but there\u2019s also food for thought!\" Taran Adarsh wrote, \"On the whole, Ramji Londonwaley is a feel-good entertainer that gives you a positive feeling at the conclusion of the show\". The BBC's Dharmesh Rajput gave the film a predominantly positive review, stating \"it's overlong and unnecessarily complicated but R Madhavan's central performance still manages to charm your socks off\". The critic added the film is \"gracelessly edited and over-stuffed with sub-plots \u2013 but the film's saving grace is its cast\", and praises that \"Madhavan's charismatic and expressive performance provides most of the film's nicely understated humour\" and British actress Shalu Verma and Bangargi also impress\". A critic from Rediff.com wrote \"it's irritating because this could have been polished into a good film, maybe even a memorable film\" and that \"Madhavan makes a valiant attempt, and renders the film almost entirely watchable, but that happens to be a big almost, sadly\"."

All this changes when he finds himself struck down by an incurable degenerative disease which means he'll need to use a wheelchair for the rest of his life. He goes into a church-run home for the disabled, believing that his immediate family don't feel able to care for him. His bitterness at his fate and his dislike of the rules and regulations of the place only serve to make him more withdrawn and angry at his enforced imprisonment. Pritchard gets to know a fellow patient, Jill Matthews (Nanette Newman), a 31-year-old woman from a wealthy family, who is also a wheelchair user, due to polio. Bruce begins to harbour romantic feelings for Matthews but, before he can make his feelings known, she leaves the institution to return home and marry longstanding fianc\u00e9, Geoffrey. However, Jill soon realises that Geoffrey is half-hearted about marrying her and so breaks off the engagement and returns to the institution. Gradually, she is able to break through Pritchard's shell of cynicism and lack of respect for authority, bringing life back to his existence. In the process, the two fall in love and admit their feelings for each other, going on to get engaged. Bruce and Jill's difficult circumstances have resulted in them finding the love of their lives. Soon, though, Jill dies from a virus. Bruce almost returns to his depression but, because of the courage he has found within himself through knowing Jill, is able to go on living."

The novel was originally published in 1964. Kirkus Reviews called it \"a short novel, written with a sharpness of intelligence and feeling, and it is altogether genuine, a word easily exploited and seldom justified.\" The New York Times called it a \"fine, moving novel.\" In 1965 director Robert Butler bought the screen rights to it and another Marshall novel, Two Lives. The novel was adapted for television by the BBC in 1967 as part of the Boy Meets Girl anthology series. The main parts were played by Ray Brooks and Anna Calder-Marshall. Dennis Potter, reviewing it for the New Statesman, said the production \"kept erupting into something raw and genuine.\" Film rights eventually went to producer Bruce Curtis, nephew of Harry Cohn, who had just made Otley (1969). He initially tried to finance the film through Columbia, but was turned down. Shelagh Delaney wrote a script. Eventually Curtis took the project to Bryan Forbes who came on board as writer and director. Forbes decided to increase the age of the characters and write the lead role for his wife, Nanette Newman. Forbes was in the unusual position of being able to green-light his own film as he was head of production for EMI Films at the time. Forbes commented that he was highly criticized in some quarters for directing a film while running the studio, even though he did not take any extra salary as the director. Once the film was made some executives at EMI did not want it released but Forbes held a successful test screening which secured company support."

After a scene in which his wife searches frantically and finds a poppet left by a jealous work rival, he discovers that his wife, Tansy (Janet Blair), is practising obeah, referred to in the film as \"conjure magic\", which she learned in Jamaica. She insists that her charms have been responsible for his rapid advancement in his academic career and for his general well-being. A firm rationalist, Norman is angered by her acceptance of superstition. He forces her to burn all her magical paraphernalia. Almost immediately things start to go wrong: a female student (Judith Stott) accuses Norman of rape, her boyfriend (Bill Mitchell) threatens him with violence, and someone tries to break into the Taylors' home during a thunderstorm. Tansy, willing to sacrifice her life for her husband's safety, almost drowns herself and is only saved at the last minute by Norman giving in to the practices he despises. Tansy attacks him with a knife while in a trance, but Norman disarms her and locks her in her room. Her limping walk during the attack gives Norman a clue to the person responsible for his ill luck: university secretary Flora Carr (Margaret Johnston), the wife of Lindsay whose career had stalled in favour of Norman's. Flora uses witchcraft to set fire to the Taylor home with Tansy trapped inside. Using a form of auditory hypnosis over a loudspeaker system, Flora convinces Norman that a giant stone eagle perching at the top of the university chapel has come to life to attack him. Lindsay arrives at the office and turns off the loudspeaker, and the illusory eagle vanishes. Tansy escapes her burning home and rejoins her no longer sceptical  husband. On their way out of the campus, Lindsay sees the chapel's heavy doors are ajar (left thus by Norman in his \"escape\" from the eagle), and insists on securing them despite Flora's protests. As she waits for him, the eagle statue falls from the roof and kills her."

Excellently photographed (not a single \"frame\" is wasted), and cunningly directed by Sidney Hayers, the incidents gather a pounding, graphic drive that is diabolically teasing. The climax is a nightmarish hair-curler but, we maintain, entirely logical within the context. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader called the film \"atmospheric and underplayed in the tradition of Val Lewton\" and, despite judging Sidney Hayers' direction as \"needlessly rhetorical at times\", \"eerily effective\". Film historian William K. Everson, though critical of Night of the Eagle for its predictability, found good words for the story and Janet Blair's performance. David Pirie of Time Out magazine, while not happy with the casting of Janet Blair, acknowledged Hayers' direction \"an almost Wellesian flourish\" and the script being \"structured with incredible tightness\". Author S. T. Joshi declared it particularly notable for its realistic portrayal of campus politics. In 1963 Night of the Eagle was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation."

Night of the Eagle depicts the use of charms or supernatural powers in an \u201ceveryday\u201d environment and juxtaposes it with a rationalist view which is questioned during the progress of events. Jacques Tourneur's Night of the Demon (1957), to which William K. Everson compared it unfavourably, works in a similar way. All three authors involved in Night of the Eagle's screenplay were prolific writers for film and television specializing in horror, mystery and science fiction. Charles Beaumont and Richard Matheson in particular were repeatedly hired to adapt (though freely) the works of Edgar Allan Poe and H. P. Lovecraft for the screen, and both were prolific writers for The Twilight Zone. While the film was accessible to an under-aged audience in the US., it was rated \"X\" (adults only) in the UK on its initial release. It was later re-rated 15, then 12 for UK home video releases. Film prints for the US release were preceded by a narrated prologue in which the voice of Paul Frees was heard to intone a spell to protect the audience members from evil. For protection, American theatre audiences were given a special pack of salt and words to an ancient incantation."

        "content": "\"Attack on Cloudbase\" is the 31st episode of Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, a British Supermarionation television series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and filmed by their production company Century 21 Productions for ITC Entertainment. The series' penultimate episode, it was written by Tony Barwick and first broadcast on 5 May 1968 on ATV London. Set in 2068, the series depicts a \"war of nerves\" between Earth and the Mysterons: a hostile race of Martians with the ability to create functioning copies of destroyed people or objects and use these reconstructions to carry out specific acts of aggression against humanity. Earth is defended by a military organisation called Spectrum, whose top agent, Captain Scarlet, was murdered by the Mysterons and replaced with a reconstruction that later broke free of their control. The double of Scarlet has powers of self-repair that enable him to recover from injuries that would be fatal to any other person, which make him Spectrum's greatest asset in its fight against the Mysterons. \"Attack on Cloudbase\" begins with Spectrum fighter pilot Symphony Angel being forced to eject into the Sahara when her aircraft is damaged. Later, a fleet of Mysteron spacecraft enter Earth's atmosphere and launch a devastating assault on Spectrum's airborne headquarters, Cloudbase. Filmed in late 1967, the episode underwent a number of script changes prior to shooting. Gerry Anderson chose Ken Turner to direct due to its unusual nature of the story. The episode presented Century 21's special effects team with several technical challenges, including a scene in which a miniature Angel aircraft overflies the puppet of Symphony Angel in the same shot. For the attack sequence, only a small number of spacecraft models were made; flashing light bulbs were placed in the backdrop as a cost-effective way to create the illusion of a larger fleet. Series composer Barry Gray wrote a full score after Anderson decided that none of the incidental music in Century 21's library suited the episode's grim tone. Critical response to \"Attack on Cloudbase\" has been mostly positive, with one commentator naming it the best episode of Captain Scarlet. Some criticism has been directed at its ending plot twist. Anderson, who likened the episode to a black comedy, praised Barwick for his \"humanised\" writing of the puppet characters. In 1980, the New York office of ITC re-edited the episode to form the ending part of the Captain Scarlet compilation film Captain Scarlet vs. the Mysterons."

On the ground, she is overcome by heat stroke and passes out. In a transmission from Mars, the Mysterons (voiced by Donald Gray) warn Spectrum that they intend to destroy its airborne headquarters, Cloudbase. Cloudbase is placed on red alert and isolated from all external contact. Destiny Angel (voiced by Liz Morgan) has been launched to search for Symphony but is recalled by base commander Colonel White (voiced by Donald Gray) in view of the Mysteron threat. This action leads to a heated exchange between White and Captain Blue (voiced by Ed Bishop), who admits that he has romantic feelings for Symphony. However, White refuses to let Blue join the ground search. Night falls, and Captain Magenta (voiced by Gary Files) detects a large object on Cloudbase's radar. Rhapsody Angel (voiced by Liz Morgan) is launched to investigate and discovers a spinning Mysteron spacecraft that destroys her fighter in mid-air. When more craft arrive, Captain Scarlet (voiced by Francis Matthews) volunteers to challenge the Mysterons in Destiny's place. However, his fighter is damaged and he crash-lands on the Cloudbase flight deck, seriously injured. As the Mysterons open fire on Cloudbase itself, medical officer Dr Fawn is killed. Posing as his assistant, Mysteron agent Captain Black reports that Scarlet's powers of self-repair have failed him and that he is therefore permanently dead. The Mysteron attack intensifies, resulting in the deaths of everyone else on board except White, Blue and Lieutenant Green (voiced by Cy Grant). As the stricken Cloudbase loses altitude, another explosion kills Green and cripples Blue. Resolving to go down with his command, White stands to attention and salutes. As Cloudbase is heard crashing to Earth, Symphony wakes up in the desert facing Scarlet and Blue, who are part of the ground forces that have been sent to rescue her. In the final scene, it is revealed that Symphony merely dreamt the attack on Cloudbase in a nightmare brought on by the desert heat."

This character was replaced with Magenta to avoid the cost of making a new sienna-coloured Spectrum uniform. Filming began on 25 October 1967, less than three weeks before Joe 90, Century 21's next series, entered production. To avoid overworking the designers, who were busy preparing for the new series, the episode was devised as a bottle show to reduce the number of puppets and sets required: unique among Captain Scarlet episodes, it features no characters other than the regular cast and was filmed mostly on existing sets. The previously unseen Cloudbase Radar Room was created using walls and props that were originally built for Thunderbirds Are Go (1966) and earlier Captain Scarlet episodes. \"Attack on Cloudbase\" is also one of only two episodes (the other being \"Flight to Atlantica\") to feature all of the regular cast, though not all of them have speaking parts. The scenes of Symphony Angel in the desert and the Mysterons attacking Cloudbase presented a number of challenges for Century 21's special effects department, headed by Derek Meddings. A scene in which Symphony looks up as Destiny Angel's fighter flies past her required close collaboration between the puppet operators and the effects crew, the former keeping the puppet under control while the latter moved the scale model across the set. The Mysteron spacecraft were modelled on \"flying saucer\" UFOs commonly reported during the 1960s. To make the spacecraft appear to spin in the moonlight, Meddings added \"veins\" to each model to reflect the lighting in the studio. Due to a shortage of model operators on set, the models were flown only in the foreground; flashing light bulbs were fitted to the backdrop to give the impression of a larger fleet. Actress Liz Morgan, who voiced Destiny and Rhapsody Angels, was overcome with emotion at one point during the dialogue-recording session: \"It was a moment when Destiny was very worried about Captain Scarlet and she was making impassioned pleas for him. Well, I started to cry, and immediately a voice came down from the recording booth and [producer] Reg Hill, who was directing that particular week, said, 'No, Liz, love. Do it again, love. Puppets don't cry!'\" Just before Cloudbase hits the ground, Colonel White is shown standing to attention and saluting in a spiralling freeze-frame shot. Anderson based this on maritime tradition, stating that he wanted the audience to see White \"[going] down like the captain of a big ship.\" \"Attack on Cloudbase\" is one of only a few Captain Scarlet episodes to have its own score instead of using incidental music recycled from a track library. Series composer Barry Gray devised the score after Anderson decided that nothing in Century 21's musical archive suited the dark nature of the plot. Performed by a 14-member band, it was the penultimate score to be produced for Captain Scarlet and was recorded on 3 December 1967 in a four-hour studio session. The CD of the series soundtrack includes pieces from \"Attack on Cloudbase\" titled \"Desert Symphony\" and \"The Mysterons Attack!\""

        "content": "In a DVD audio commentary that he recorded for the episode, Anderson stated that although \"Attack on Cloudbase\" was intended to be humorous, he believed that the finished episode was more of a \"black comedy\". He praised the script, noting Blue's feelings for Symphony and his conflict with White as examples of Tony Barwick's \"humanisation\" of the puppet characters. He also described Captain Magenta's comical commentary on the attack, which ends only with the character's death, as another \"wonderful example of 'Barwickism'\". Though acknowledging that dream sequences might seem clich\u00e9d, he defended the episode's use of a nightmare plot mechanism for its power to frighten, and then re-assure, the audience. He argued that the dark tone is lightened by the closing scene, which he said was written as there had to be \"a sequence where everyone was happy together, and clearly no one had come to any grief\", thus forming the \"inevitable happy ending\" to a tragic story. James Stansfield of the website Den of Geek considers \"Attack on Cloudbase\" to be the best episode of Captain Scarlet. Describing the episode as highly entertaining even if \"shocking and surprisingly bleak\", he praises the writing and characterisation \u2013 in particular, the death of Rhapsody Angel and the conflict between Blue and White. However, he comments negatively on the dream plot twist as well as what he regards as a minor plot hole: for reasons that are unclear, the stranded Symphony throws away her helmet, thus making it impossible for Spectrum to contact her. Stansfield suggests that the nightmarish nature of the plot is implied long before it is confirmed in dialogue, suggesting that moments such as the death of the \"indestructible\" Scarlet, and Blue's lack of astonishment at the sudden appearance of Captain Black, serve as \"hints ... that all might not be quite as it seems\". In 2019, British magazine TV Years (a sister publication of TV Choice) listed the attack sequences as the 23rdgreatest moment in TV science fiction, calling the episode \"devastating\" up until the plot twist. Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy calls the episode \"thrilling\" and \"perhaps the highlight\" of the series. However, he criticises the \"lame, 'it was all a dream' ending\", arguing that it is made more frustrating by the fact that the final episode, \"The Inquisition\", is a clip show that ends with the conflict between Earth and the Mysterons unresolved: \"Cut the final few minutes from 'Attack on Cloudbase' and imagine what a finale that would have been!\" Andrew Thomas of Dreamwatch magazine considers dream sequences an \"appalling\" narrative technique but describes the episode's scenes of destruction as \"very well handled\". Martin Cater of Network Distributing judges the episode \"dramatic\" and \"memorable\" despite its dependence on a \"cop-out\" dream sequence. He compares it to the Fireball XL5 episode \"A Day in the Life of a Space General\" (1963), which features an \"orgy of destruction with the convenient cop-out of a dream to act as a 'reset button'.\" Chris Drake and Graeme Bassett describe \"Attack on Cloudbase\" as \"tense and exciting\", stating that it is \"guaranteed to keep the viewer guessing\". Some commentators have questioned why no explanation is given for the explosion that brings down Symphony's fighter at the start of the episode. The British Board of Film Classification certifies the episode U, noting that it contains \"very mild fantasy\" violence."

        "content": "Zohan Dvir is a promiscuous, superhuman Israeli counter-terrorist of the Israel Defense Forces. Despite his success and popularity, he has grown tired of the everlasting conflicts in his country and dreams of becoming a hairstylist at Paul Mitchell's in the United States. He finally admits to his parents his desire to cut hair, but they make fun of him. During his next mission against a Palestinian terrorist group led by his arch-enemy, superhuman Fatoush \"Phantom\" Hakbarah, Zohan fakes his own death and smuggles himself onto a plane to New York City, cuts his hair, and adopts the alias \"Scrappy Coco\" after two dogs (Scrappy and Coco) whom he shared the flight with. Following his \"success\" at killing Zohan, Phantom opens a restaurant chain called Phantom Muchentuchen. After his arrival in the United States, Zohan immediately goes to Paul Mitchell's salon to ask for a job where the stylists laugh at him. He tries other salons, but is also refused due to his lack of experience. Zohan befriends a Jewish man named Michael after defending him against a bullying motorist, and is taken in by him and his mother, Gail. Zohan and Gail have sex, much to Michael's disapproval. Zohan then meets a fellow Israeli immigrant named Oori at a disco. Oori recognizes Zohan but vows to keep his identity a secret and brings him to an area in lower Manhattan populated by other Middle Eastern immigrants, including Palestinian and Israeli Americans. Zohan attempts to secure a job with the struggling salon of a Palestinian woman named Dalia, but she only allows Zohan to sweep the floors. When one of her stylists unexpectedly quits, one of the customers asks Zohan to cut her hair. Zohan proceeds to give her a sexually charged but exceptional haircut; and has sex with her in the bathroom. Zohan's reputation spreads rapidly among the elderly women of lower Manhattan, causing Dalia's business to prosper, which upsets Grant Walbridge, a corporate magnate who has been trying to buy out all the local tenants on the block so that he can build a massive mall with a roller coaster in it. Zohan is eventually identified by a Palestinian cab driver named Salim, who bears a grudge against Zohan for having taken his beloved goat away in Palestine because Salim spat on him. Salim convinces his friends, Hamdi and Nasi, to help him kill Zohan, but after several failed attempts they are forced to contact Phantom and convince him to visit New York to find Zohan. Meanwhile, Zohan has fallen in love with Dalia and comes clean to her, Michael, and Gail about his true identity. After Dalia rejects Zohan for his counterterrorist background, Zohan decides to leave to protect her, and confronts Phantom in a championship Hacky Sack game sponsored by Walbridge. Zohan's fight is cut short with sudden news of the Middle Eastern neighborhood being attacked and he quickly departs. As their businesses burn, Zohan calms the Israelis and Palestinians who each blame the other for the violence and makes peace with Salim. Phantom then appears and confronts Zohan, but Zohan refuses to fight. Dalia appears, revealing that she is Phantom's sister, and convinces her brother to cooperate with Zohan against the arsonists, revealed to be racist white supremacists led by James T. O'Scanlon. They were hired by Walbridge to instigate an inter-ethnic riot so he can get his new mall in the aftermath. As Zohan and Phantom work to save the block, Phantom admits that he always wanted to be a shoe salesman rather than a terrorist. Although the racist arsonists are defeated and Walbridge is arrested by the police, the overexcited Phantom accidentally destroys all of the shops on the block with his powerful screams. With the Israelis and Palestinians united, the block is rebuilt and transformed into a collectively owned mall. Phantom opens a shoe shop there; Oori relocates his electronics shop to the mall; Salim gets back his goat from Zohan and starts a goat ride business; Michael becomes a hairdresser; and Zohan and Dalia, having now married, open a beauty salon together. In the end, Zohan's parents arrive and approve of his new job and lifestyle before his father requests that he cut his hair, which Zohan happily does."

        "content": "Sandler, Robert Smigel, and Judd Apatow wrote the first draft of the script in 2000, but the movie was delayed after the events of 9/11 because those involved felt that the subject would be too sensitive. Apatow left the project after the first draft in 2000 to work on his show Undeclared and had, for the most part, not been involved in the project since. The film is based in part on the story of Nezi Arbib, an Israeli soldier who after his service moved to southern California and opened a hair salon. Sandler trained with Arbib and his brothers, also former soldiers, for two weeks to learn hairstyling and work with clients. The movie features elements that first appeared in the SNL sketches \"Sabra Shopping Network\" and \"Sabra Price Is Right,\" which starred Tom Hanks and were written by Robert Smigel. They originated lines such as 'Sony guts' and 'Disco, Disco, good, good'. The first sketch is also notable for featuring one of Adam Sandler's first (uncredited) television appearances while the second featured Sandler, Schneider, Smigel and Kevin Nealon in supporting parts. Robert Smigel worked with Sandler on past films including Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Little Nicky, but this was the first time in which he was credited for helping to write the script. He was also an executive producer on the film which allowed him to further contribute to the movie's comedic sensibility. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz commented that the movie was known in Hollywood circles as \"the Israeli movie.\" Haaretz also noted that while \"Israeli actors were rushing to audition [for the movie],\" the response among Arab actors was far from enthusiastic. (Emmanuelle Chriqui, who played Zohan's Palestinian love interest, was raised as an Orthodox Jew.) The film poked fun at the popularity of hummus in Israeli culture. In the movie, characters used it to brush their teeth and as a method to douse the flames of a fire, as well as a hair care product."

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, and called it \"a mighty hymn of and to vulgarity, and either you enjoy it, or you don't.\" Ebert admitted \"I found myself enjoying it a surprising amount of the time, even though I was thoroughly ashamed of myself.\" David Edelstein of New York Magazine went as far as to say \"Adam Sandler is mesmerizing\".

        "content": "Arthur \"Cody\" Jarrett is a ruthless, psychotic criminal and leader of the Jarrett gang. Although married to Verna, he is overly attached to his equally crooked and determined mother, \"Ma\" Jarrett. Cody and his gang rob a mail train in the Sierra Nevada mountains, killing four members of the train's crew. While on the lam, Cody has a severe migraine, which Ma nurses him through. Afterward, Ma and Cody have a quick drink and toast, \"Top of the world!\", before rejoining the others. The gang splits up. Informants enable the authorities to close in on a motor court in Los Angeles where Cody, Verna, and Ma are holed up. Cody shoots and wounds US Treasury investigator Philip Evans and makes his escape. He then puts his emergency scheme in motion: confess to a lesser crime committed by an associate in Springfield, Illinois, at the same time as the train job\u2014a federal crime\u2014thus providing him with a false alibi and assuring him a lesser sentence. He turns himself in and is sentenced to one to three years in state prison. Evans, however, plants undercover agent Hank Fallon (as \"Vic Pardo\") in Cody's cell. His task is to find the \"Trader\", a fence who launders stolen money for Cody. On the outside, \"Big Ed\" Somers, Cody's ambitious right-hand man, takes charge. Verna betrays Cody and joins Ed. Ed pays inmate Roy Parker to kill Cody. In the prison workshop, Parker attempts to drop a heavy piece of machinery on Cody, but Hank pushes Cody out of the way, saving his life and gaining Cody's trust. Ma visits and vows to \"take care of\" Big Ed, despite Cody's frantic attempts to dissuade her. He starts worrying and decides to break out with Hank. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Verna has murdered Ma, whom she despised, by shooting her in the back.  Big Ed knows this and holds this information over Verna to keep her with him. When Cody learns of Ma's death by way of a new inmate, he goes berserk in the mess hall. He concocts an escape plan. In the infirmary, he is diagnosed as having a \"homicidal psychosis\" and is recommended for transfer to an asylum. Another inmate sneaks him a gun, which Cody uses to take hostages, and along with Hank and their cellmates, Cody escapes. They also take along Parker. Cody later kills him in cold blood. When they learn of Cody's escape, Big Ed and Verna anxiously await his return. Verna tries slipping away, but Cody catches her. Although Verna murdered Ma, she convinces Cody that Big Ed did it, so Cody guns him down. The gang welcome the escapees, including Hank, whom Cody likes and trusts. They start planning their next job. A stranger shows up at the gang's isolated hideout, asking to use the phone. Hank is concerned. Cody introduces the stranger as \"The Trader,\" Daniel Winston. Cody plans to steal a chemical plant's payroll by using an empty tanker truck as a Trojan horse.  Hank says he will repair Verna's radio, then rigs a signal transmitter and attaches it to the Trojan tanker; on the way to the plant, he manages to get a message to Evans. The police track the tanker and prepare an ambush. The gang gets into the payroll office, but the tanker driver, ex-con \"Bo\" Creel, recognizes Hank and informs Cody. Having tracked the truck to Long Beach, California, using direction finders, the police surround the building and call on Cody to surrender; he decides to fight it out. When the police fire tear gas into the office, Hank manages to escape. In the ensuing gun battle, the police kill most of Cody's gang and Verna is arrested. Cody shoots one of his own men for trying to surrender. Finally, only Cody is still loose. He flees to the top of a gigantic, globe-shaped gas storage tank. After Hank shoots Cody several times with a rifle, Cody fires at the tank, which bursts into flames. He shouts \"Made it, Ma! Top of the world!\" before the tank explodes."

        "content": "After winning an Oscar for Yankee Doodle Dandy, Cagney left Warner Brothers in 1942 to form his own production company with his business manager and brother, William.  After making four unsuccessful movies (including the well-regarded, but \"financially disastrous\" adaptation of William Saroyan's The Time of Your Life), Cagney returned to Warner in mid-1949. His decision to return was purely financial; Cagney admitted he \"needed the money,\" and that he never forgot the \"hell\" Warner put him through in the 1930s when it came to renewing his contract. Likewise, the last thing Jack Warner wanted to see was Cagney back on his lot; referring to him as \"that little bastard\", he vowed to never take him back. Cagney's new contract with Warner enabled him to make $250,000 per film on a schedule of one film per year, plus script approval and the opportunity to develop projects for his own company. To make good on his comeback, Cagney settled on the script for White Heat; on May 6, 1949, he signed on to portray Arthur \"Cody\" Jarrett. Much to Jack Warner's dismay, it was writers Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts who suggested him for the lead, claiming \"there's only one man who can play [Jarrett] and make the rafters rock.\" For years, Cagney resisted gangster roles in an effort to avoid typecasting, but decided to return to the genre after feeling his box office power waning. Following Cagney's attachment, Warner increased the production budget to $1 million and hired Raoul Walsh to direct. Walsh had previously worked with Cagney on The Roaring Twenties (in 1939) and The Strawberry Blonde (in 1941). However, Cagney was unhappy with the studio's decision to hire Walsh; in part, because he requested Frank McHugh be in the film, but Warner turned his friend down in an attempt to cut costs."

        "content": "Warner bought the rights to the story from Virginia Kellogg for $2,000. Being \"methodical craftsmen\", it took Goff and Roberts six months to complete the first draft. They \"would plot in complete detail before even beginning to write, then write their dialogue together, line by line.\" When Walsh saw it, he pleaded with Cagney's brother, William, to talk Cagney out of doing the picture. According to him, the draft was \"bad\u2014a real potboiler,\" but William reassured Walsh that \"Jimmy [would] rewrite it as much as possible.\" White Heat was meant to be based on the true story of Ma Barker, a bank robber who raised her four sons as criminals. However, this was changed along with Cagney's involvement; Ma Barker became Ma Jarrett, and her four children were reduced to two. Arthur Barker became Arthur \"Cody\" Jarrett, a psychopath with a mother fixation. Cody's mental illness and the exact cause of his migraines remain a mystery throughout the film. This was done intentionally, enabling viewers to use their imaginations and draw their own conclusions. In total, the script received several rewrites, with input being given from some of Cagney's closest friends. Humphrey Bogart and Frank McHugh worked \"after hours\" on revisions; with McHugh writing the film's opening scene. The script is notable for reworking many themes from Cagney's previous films with Warner. Most notably, in The Public Enemy, Cagney smashed a grapefruit into Mae Clarke's face; in White Heat he kicks Virginia Mayo off a chair. In Each Dawn I Die, his character suffers the ill effects of prison; while here, his character has a breakdown in the prison mess hall. Furthermore, in The Roaring Twenties Cagney fought with rival gangsters in a similar fashion to how Cody Jarrett stalks the double-crossing \"Big Ed\" Somers (portrayed by Steve Cochran)."

        "content": "The production began on May 5, 1949 and lasted six weeks until completion on June 20. Walsh made use of a number of locations in southern California; first by going to the Santa Susana Mountains (near his home) to shoot \"chase scenes\". He then moved on to an old Southern Pacific tunnel near Chatsworth to stage the opening robbery scenes. Urban street scenes along with the \"Milbank Hotel\" were shot in and around Van Nuys. The \"hideaway lodge sequences\" were shot at the Warner ranch, the interior scenes in the studio itself, and the climax scene at an oil refinery near Torrance, south of Los Angeles. The drive-in theater scenes were shot at the now demolished San Val Drive-In in Burbank. Jack Warner wanted the prison mess hall scene replaced for budgetary reasons, stating the \"cost of a single scene with 600 extras and only one line of dialogue would be exorbitant.\" For this reason, Warner wanted the scene shot in a chapel, but relented when \"the writers pointed out that, apart from the fact that Jarrett would [never be willingly caught in a] chapel\", the whole point of the scene was to \"have a lot of noise, with rattling knives and forks and chatter, that suddenly goes completely silent when Jarrett first screams.\" The scream was improvised by Cagney, and the shock on everyone's face was real, for neither Cagney nor Walsh informed any of the extras of what was going to happen. Warner agreed to the scene on the condition that it be shot in three hours, so \"that the extras were through by lunchtime.\" A number of scenes were improvised; Walsh's \"personal touches go beyond the script.\" When Cody and his gang hide out in their cabin just after the train heist, Cody has one of his \"debilitating headaches\", causing him to fall from his chair and fire off a round from his .45. This was Walsh's idea, as was the showing of Virginia Mayo's upper thigh on screen. Another scene involved Cody giving his wife, Verna, a \"seething look\", but Walsh improvised and had Cagney knock her off of her chair. Cagney claimed it was his idea \"to have Cody climb onto Ma Jarrett's lap and sit there; being soothed during one of his psychotic [episodes]\", but Walsh has always denied this; claiming many years later that it was his idea."

Chaplin, in top hat and tails (but baggy pants), sits on a park bench with his wife, Mabel. While he has gone to a bar, conning his way out of paying for his drinks, the large man sits with Charlie's wife and starts flirting. Chaplin returns to find them laughing together. But despite kicking him and hitting him with his cane the man is undeterred in his wooing of his wife. Meanwhile, Charlie is met by the man's wife and they return together, where the large man's wife first confronts him but then ends up confronting Mabel. She starts to throttle her then goes to strike her, but accidentally hits Charlie instead. The couple then leave. Charlie orders Mabel to go home while he returns to the bar where a man at the bar mocks him. Mabel stops at a sporting goods store where she orders a man-shaped punch-bag. She wants to learn how to fight. It is delivered while she is still in her pyjamas. She wraps herself in a leopard-skin rug to answer the door. She starts practising boxing moves on the dummy/punchbag. It is weighted so it swings back and knocks her over. Meanwhile, in the bar the large man reappears and is clearly a friend of the mocker and he further ridicules Charlie (who is by now drunk). When the man tousles Charlie's hair a fight starts. Charlie then returns home, holding a bunch of fresh onions, as though they were flowers, and trying to work out what the smell is. Repulsed by the smell, he throws them away, which fly through an open door and onto Mabel who is in bed. Charlie in his drunken state sees the dummy as the large man and prepares to fight. Charlie demands the dummy leaves. He pushes it, which swings back then rolls forward again striking Charlie. Charlie tries to placate it but ends up striking it again and getting knocked over. Mabel watches from the bedroom, amused by his actions. He strikes the dummy again and is thrown onto the bed, where he sees Mabel. Believing that she has cheated on him, Charlie throttles her and leads her to the dummy. She tries to placate him, while he keeps striking the dummy and getting knocked over by it. She eventually reveals to him that it is just a dummy. Meanwhile, neighbours get concerned at the noise and stand outside his apartment door.

        "content": "Dawkins points to some of science\u2019s achievements and describes it as freeing most people from superstition and dogma. Picking up from his superstition-reason distinction in The Root of All Evil? (while recycling some footage from it), he then says reason is facing an \"epidemic of superstition\" that \"impoverishes our culture\" and introduces gurus that persuade us \"to run away from reality\". He calls the present day dangerous times. He returns to science\u2019s achievements, including the fact that, by extending people's lifespan, it helps them to take more advantage of life. He turns his attention to astrology, which he criticizes for stereotyping without evidence. Having put astrology to the test and referred to larger-scale experiments, he then briefly describes the mechanics of astronomy, and then expresses frustration that 50% of the UK population \u2013 more than are members of one religion \u2013 believe in the paranormal. He then visits a psychic medium, Simon Goodfellow, who makes statements Dawkins interprets as referring to retirement \u2013 which most people his age would soon be going in for but not Dawkins. Cornell then finds himself in contradiction over whether or not the \"spirit G\", who allegedly communicates with him, is Dawkins's family member. Cornell next tries suggesting this spirit was in the military \u2013 again, typical of deceased relatives of people Dawkins\u2019s age, but not of Dawkins. Cornell finishes with several explanations of why his powers might not always work, but Dawkins insists extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and then talks to the sceptical Derren Brown about cold reading, including misleading tricks it uses. In another notable segment Dawkins visits a psychic for \u00a350 who said she could hear or see his father \"on the other side.\" Dawkins let the woman do the reading and at the end informed her that his father is alive, and he visits him frequently. Dawkins now visits a spiritualist church, and makes several criticisms of the alleged evidence of communication with the dead by medium Craig Hamilton-Parker, and adds that many may become obsessed with such performances and find it difficult to get over the loss of loved ones, adding that most people present are regulars. Hamilton-Parker says his psychic powers have been \"proven to me against my rationality\". Dawkins ends his study of s\u00e9ances by noting the arguments are based on untestable, private, subjective anecdotes, and compares this to religion. Dawkins now describes the history of scientific knowledge of echolocation, and points to the cumulative build-up of corroborating evidence for scientific explanations of the phenomena. He visits psychologist Chris French, who is performing a double-blind test of dowsing. None of the dowsers perform better, in a statistically significant sense, than is expectable by chance alone. While the dowsers are surprised, Dawkins and French note that their confidence is untouched, and they prefer explanations (French states some may call them excuses) that retain the hypothesis that they have paranormal dowsing powers. Dawkins next attempts his own explanation of belief in the paranormal in a combination of evolutionary and psychological terms, saying: \"we don\u2019t want to believe things just happen\", and he suggests superstition is just the sort of animal error committed by Skinner\u2019s pigeons. Dawkins now interviews Satish Kumar about ideas such as 'treeness' and 'rockness'. Dawkins points out that it is all evidence-free assertion. He responds to the \"science is bleak\" argument by saying that the world is so wonderful that the word 'mundane' has a mismatched meaning and etymology. He then complains about the long-term fall in the number of students taking chemistry and physics at A-level. He suggests this is partly because of the UK education system encouraging students to value personal feeling over evidence and reason. He interviews the relativist Steve Fuller and criticises him for being \"so close to being right but ... damn wrong\". Fuller points out that different people can interpret the same evidence differently. Fuller also points out the benefits of the Internet, and Dawkins agrees, but then turns to the dangers it poses in causing the spread of fabricated statements. He also points to the fact that the MMR vaccine scandal involved an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory about the UK government. Dawkins concludes that reason \"built the modern world. It is a precious but fragile thing\"."

Dawkins observes these treatments have fanciful rationales and rituals behind them, with many alternative treatments employing pseudoscientific jargon such as \"energy\", \"vibration\" or \"quantum theory\" to give themselves greater credence to patients. Homeopathy is singled out as an example of a mainstream alternative medicine that has public support and taxpayer funding through the National Health Service. Dawkins explains that the rationale behind it is unfounded and demonstrates that the magnitude of dilution required is so great the patient is practically imbibing pure water. This is illustrated by the typical homeopathic dilution of 30C (1:10030, that is thirty steps of dilution by 1% each time), which requires a drop of active ingredient dissolved in a body of water greater than the whole ocean. Dawkins cites a 2005 meta-analysis by The Lancet that concludes that homeopathy has no consistently demonstrable effect on health. Dawkins hypothesises that practitioners of alternative medicine spend longer time than regular doctors on their patients when attending to them. An interview with Professor Nicholas Humphrey suggests that this empathic attention may cause a placebo effect in patients, but this is not a substitute for conventional science-based medicine. The episode concludes with Dawkins making an appeal to skeptical, rational inquiry based on evidence, claiming \"reason has liberated us from superstition and given us centuries of progress. We abandon it at our peril.\""

Set in New York, the story introduced the detective genius Nero Wolfe (Edward Arnold) and his assistant Archie Goodwin (Lionel Stander). The partnership endured through 33 novels and 39 short stories written by Stout, but continued in only one more film for Columbia Pictures.  Wolfe's client is portrayed by Rita Hayworth, then billed as Rita Cansino, in an early performance. The titles of the film begin with the November 1934 issue of The American Magazine \u2014 in which the abridged version of Fer-de-Lance appeared \u2014 lying on a table. The magazine is taken from the table and opened to an illustrated spread that reads, \"Edward Arnold in Meet Nero Wolfe.\""

        "content": "At the West Hills Golf Club in Westchester, E.J. Kimball (Walter Kingsford) and his son Manuel (Russell Hardie) are welcomed into the party of elderly Professor Barstow (Boyd Irwin Sr.) and his prospective son-in-law Claude Roberts (Victor Jory). Barstow sends his caddy back to the clubhouse to fetch his visor, and finds himself without his clubs when it is his turn to tee off. The elder Kimball loans his driver to Barstow. Immediately after hitting his drive, Barstow flinches. \"A mosquito bit me just as I hit the ball,\" he complains with good humor. \"Too bad,\" Kimball replies sympathetically, taking the club from Barstow and making his own drive. As the foursome sets out on the course, Barstow is stricken and succumbs quickly to an apparent heart attack. At the New York brownstone of Nero Wolfe (Edward Arnold), Marie Maringola (Rita Hayworth) offers the sedentary detective genius $50 to find her brother. Although he is an expert metal worker, Carlo Maringola had such trouble finding work in America that he planned to return to the old country. On the eve of his departure Carlo told his sister that he could stay in America after all \u2014 he got a job. They had arranged a celebration but Carlo never came. He disappeared. Wolfe takes Maria's case and sends his confidential assistant Archie Goodwin (Lionel Stander) to investigate at Carlo's apartment house. Archie returns to the brownstone with evidence that suggests that Carlo will never be found alive \u2014 and that his death is linked to the death of Professor Barstow. Wolfe theorizes that Barstow was killed by a specially constructed golf club, one that was converted by Carlo into an air rifle that propelled a poisoned needle into his midsection when he struck the ball. His theory is borne out by an autopsy of Barstow, and the discovery of Carlo's body. Solving the murder of Professor Barstow will be a far more lucrative endeavor, Wolfe is pleased to learn: a $50,000 reward has been offered. But interviews with Barstow's daughter (Joan Perry), his widow (Nana Bryant) and his doctor (Frank Conroy), do little to advance the investigation. Far more helpful is a luncheon for the four boys who caddied for Professor Barstow's foursome. Hearing their accounts, Wolfe concludes that the intended murder victim had been E.J. Kimball, not Barstow. Kimball dismisses the notion that his life is in danger until he is informed that his car has been wrecked and his chauffeur is dead \u2014 killed by a fer-de-lance, a South American snake that is probably the most poisonous in the world. The autopsies of Professor Barstow and Carlo Maringola reveal that they too were poisoned, by the venom of the fer-de-lance. Convinced that his life is in deadly peril, Kimball pleads for Wolfe's help. After E.J. Kimball tells him about his sensational past in South America, Wolfe concludes that at least six people had reason to wish him dead \u2014 and that the Barstow family is not above suspicion. Wolfe assigns Archie to move in with Kimball and his son, to watch over the old man. After a long game of Monopoly on the Kimballs' terrace that evening, the three men rise to go in to dinner \u2014 and shots are fired. The attack causes Wolfe to summon all of the principals to the brownstone. They are to spend the night, and they will stay as long as necessary.  The next evening a deadly parcel arrives, addressed to Wolfe. The killer has Wolfe in his sights \u2014 and Wolfe knows he has the killer under his roof."

Instead Edward Arnold got it,\" reported John McAleer in Rex Stout: A Biography (1977). \"Columbia's idea was to keep Arnold busy with low-cost Wolfe films between features. Two films presently were made by Columbia, Meet Nero Wolfe (Fer-de-Lance) and The League of Frightened Men. Connolly did portray Wolfe in the latter film, after Arnold decided he did not want to become identified in the public mind with one part. Lionel Stander portrayed Archie Goodwin. Stander was a capable actor but, as Archie, Rex thought he had been miscast.\" Meet Nero Wolfe was the second film directed by Herbert Biberman (1900\u20131971), a director rooted in the theater who became best known as one of the Hollywood Ten. \"Fresh from the theater, Biberman blocked shots instead of composing them,\" wrote Bernard F. Dick in Radical Innocence: A Critical Study of the Hollywood Ten (1989): Biberman opened up the action a bit, but the plot, based on Stout's Fer-de-Lance (1934), defeated him. He simply did not understand the medium; the cast reacts as it would on stage, but in film a stage reaction is overacting. Apart from some filmic touches \u2014 swish pans, dissolves, wipes, and an eerie shot of a dead man's hand clutching a newspaper clipping that another hand reaches down to retrieve \u2014 Meet Nero Wolfe is like a West End melodrama aimed at the tourist trade \u2014 slick, but so ephemeral that two days later the plot has vanished from the memory. The film's greatest departure from the original story is the creation of Mazie Gray, who can indeed call herself Mrs. Archie Goodwin at the end of Meet Nero Wolfe. The decidedly un-Wolfean character is played by Dennie Moore,  memorable for her performance as Olga the gossipy manicurist in the 1939 film, The Women."

        "content": "\"A most comforting sort of detective for these humid days is Nero Wolfe, a sedentary sleuth given to drinking great quantities of homemade beer in his cool, shade-drawn brownstone and solving murder mysteries therefrom by means of remote control,\" wrote The New York Times (July 16, 1936): Mr. Wolfe is, of course, the rotund Edward Arnold, whose characterization of Rex Stout's fairly recent fictional figure presages brisk competition for such current screen master minds as Philo Vance and Perry Mason, both in matters of deduction as well as esthetically. Where Mr. Vance, for example, collects old chrysoprase and what not, Nero Wolfe grows orchids. Mr. Wolfe sets a precedent, too, in achieving something that seems not to have occurred to the other ratiocinators of the cinema. He collects huge fees. \"Its hero, less dashing than Philo Vance and less whimsical than Charlie Chan, but more mercenary than either, will be a highly acceptable addition to the screen's growing corps of private operatives,\" wrote Time (July 27, 1936). \"The comedy and the guessing elements have been deftly mixed, the well-knit narrative precludes any drooping in interest and the cast disports itself in crack whodunit fashion,\" wrote Variety (July 22, 1936): In bringing the Rex Stout figment to life Arnold has contributed lots more than girth and a capacity for beer guzzling. His Nero Wolfe jells suavely with the imagination and makes a piquant example of personality conception. For seven years this corpulent sleuth, with a craving for nothing but good food and ease, has not ventured from his home. When he isn't unraveling a crime for the cash it will bring him, he gravitates between two hobbies, bottle tilting and orchid growing. Task of digging up evidence and following out leads for Wolfe on the outside falls to Lionel Stander. It's a typical mugg role for Stander but the performance he turns in pegs him as an important entertainment factor in the film. In 2002 Scarlet Street magazine revisited Meet Nero Wolfe \u2014 little seen in the years after its release \u2014 and found it neither the travesty it is sometimes thought to be, nor a faithful recreation of the world of Nero Wolfe. Is it absurd and a \"betrayal\" of Stout to make Wolfe's orchid room a kind of greenhouse offshoot to his office? Of course, it is, but it's also a clever device that keeps the orchid-growing obsession in the action without breaking from the fairly complicated plot. Other departures \u2014 such as transforming chef Fritz Brenner into the Swedish Olaf ... are less explicable. ... What goes wrong \u2014 at least from a purist's standpoint \u2014 is the decision to portray Wolfe as a far too jolly character. This is odd in itself, since Arnold was rarely an actor who specialized in projecting good humor. Judging the film as a film and dismissing questions of fidelity to the source material, Meet Nero Wolfe is an above average minor A picture, a solid mystery, and unfailingly entertaining. Certain things \u2014 such as a sequence involving Archie playing the then new game of Monopoly \u2014 have a nice time capsule quality that has nothing to do with the Wolfe books, but have a value all their own. No, at bottom, it's not Rex Stout's Nero and Archie, but it's a well-developed mystery (thanks to Stout's plot) with compensations all its own \u2014 and an interesting piece of Wolfeana."

After Raghavan's father's death the whole responsibility of the family came upon Raghavan. His father had left with them huge amount of debts which then reached a stage of attachment from court. At that critical juncture it was Raghavan's uncle Kunjammama who helped them repay the debts by selling his property out of love for Raghavan's father and his family. Raghavan's brother Vijayakumaran Nair is studying for LLB. Raghavan has pinged his entire hope on his brother Vijayakumaran and wants to see him as a lawyer. After Vijayakumaran became a lawyer he gets a marriage proposal of a senior advocate's (under whom he practises) daughter Shobha (Ilavarasi). The marriage takes place contrary to the understanding that it is Nalini (daughter of Kunjammama) who is to marry him. However, before the marriage, regarding this matter there was a small clash between him and his brother Raghavan. Since Raghavan felt that he was not being loyal to Kunjammama's daughter Nalini who were to marry Vijayakumaran, he arranges a marriage for her before his brother's marriage. After the marriage Shobha tries to dominate the house in each and every matter. There occurs small clashes between her and the family members. Later a marriage proposal for the brothers' only sister Sudha arrives for which the bridegroom's family demand large amount of money and gold. In order to meet this Raghavan had to ask the help of his brother who in turn turns for the same to his wife Shobha. Shobha says that she will give the money on the condition that it will be returned and in the family she will be respected. One day when the family sit together for meal Raghavan comes in between straight from the fields to dine with them. This irritates Shobha and she tells that it is unhygienic and she cannot stand the bad odour emanating from the mud-filled Raghavan. This in turn infuriates Sudha who sees her elder brother insulted. Shobha who takes Sudha's stand in the situation as threatening tries to evade from her earlier stand to give money for Sudha's marriage. However she is ready to help them if only the entire family is ready to bow before her. This Raghavan sees as an insult to the entire family. He then decides to make the entire money by himself. In order to do so he pawns his share of the family wealth and finds money for the marriage. Meanwhile, another egoistic encounter of Sobha with Kunjammama forces him to leave the family. When Raghavan also felt that his stay with his brother would only destroy the entire family, he also leaves the family to a new place, find some land and starts farming. After his brother left Vijayakumaran who is now alienated in the home feels estranged completely. He then meets his father in law (the advocate) who tells him that it was his mistake that he could not control his wife which led to all this. Vijayakumaran then confronts his wife reasons her and slaps her. He then goes to his brother who now stays in a new place and asks him to come back. But Raghavan rejects his brothers request with love and tells him that he is always with him and will come back to home whenever he feels like he should meet his brother. The movie ends with Raghavan cherishing his love for his brother."

The film was also well received in mainland China, where it had been released a year earlier, where it became one of the most successful independent films released domestically."

        "content": "After poisoning and killing his wife, the master of the house, Stephen Lowry (Granger), is blackmailed by his Cockney maid, Lily Watkins (Jean Simmons), who demands promotion. As she steadily takes the place of his dead wife, Lowry attempts to murder her as well. While attempting to murder Lily, by following someone who looked like her through the fog, he mistakenly kills Constable Burke's wife and gets chased by an angry mob, which he evades. Lily returns home and Stephen learns of his mistake. Some local bar-goers saw him murder Mrs Burke and Stephen is put on trial, but their claims are dismissed after  they are revealed to drink a lot and Lily lies to provide an alibi. The main testimony however is Lily's - who swears he never left the house - she does this as she wants to marry him. Although Lowry owes Lily his life, his eyes are on another woman - Elizabeth Travers - the daughter of a wealthy man - and object of affection of his lawyer. He tells Lily it is part of a plot to gain money and he will use the money to take Lily and himself to America. He suggests he will marry her but demands she retrieves a letter she sent to her sister telling of Lowry's actions. But Herbert, her sister's husband rescues the letter from the fire. He goes to Lowry's lawyer and tries to extort \u00a3500 for the incriminating letter. Lowry feigns illness and sends the maid to fetch the doctor. She says she will return urgently with the doctor within five minutes. He calculates this will be enough time for him to frame the maid by drinking the poison that he used to kill his own wife and planting it and his wife's jewelry in the maid's room. Lily is, however, detained by the police as a \"tell-all\" letter she has written to her sister, to safeguard herself after the master's failed plot to kill her, surfaces. Lowry's plan backfires - he is dying. He gets Burke the local policeman to run for the doctor. Meanwhile Lily's handwriting is compared to the letter. Lily is told it doesn't match - but it does. A warrant is sworn for the arrest of Lowry. Lily returns too late, and the doctor declares it is too late to save him. Lily pieces together the situation, realising that Stephen never loved her, then is arrested by police at the scene as Lowry accuses her of poisoning both him and his wife."

Arthur Lubin bought the rights to the story in August 1949 for his own company. Several parties were interested in the story. The rights holders liked the job Lubin did on Two Sinners based on the story of a friend of theirs, Warwick Deeping. Lubin hoped to make the film in October 1949 from a script by Dorothy Reid with Glenn Ford starring. However Lubin instead made Francis the Talking Mule and became busy doing comedies with animals. He continued to seek finance for The Interruption saying he wanted to \"remind producers that he can direct people too.\" In August 1951 he said he said signed Leonard Styles to play the barrister and wanted to make the movie after It Grows on Trees. In April 1952 Lubin said Dorothy Reid was writing a script and that he hoped to star Jean Simmons or Jennifer Jones in the female lead and Robert Donat in the male lead. In July 1952 Lubin said he was about to sign a deal with James Woolf of Romulus Films. He visited England in August seeking to raise finance and hoped for Terence Rattigan to write the script. In October 1953 Lubin, who had just made Star of India in England, said he planned to shoot it in that country as The Interrupted with Glynis Johns starring. In March 1954 the film was called Deadlock and Lubin had sent a script to Alec Guinness. Then in June 1954 Lubin said Columbia had agreed to finance and that Maureen O'Hara and George Sanders would star. Then in October Lubin announced the stars would be Stewart Granger and Jean Simmons and the film would be made by Mike Frankovich's company, Film Locations. Later the title would be changed to Rebound before Footsteps in the Fog. The film was to be the second in a four picture slate from Frankovich's Film Locations. The first was Fire Over Africa. The third was to be Ghosts of Drury Lane directed by Lubin. The fourth was to be Matador starring and directed by Jos\u00e9Ferrer. The third and fourth films were not made."

When the warden recalls that it was he, as district attorney, that helped put him behind bars, he makes him his valet. Graham enjoys the change, especially the company of the warden's pretty young daughter, Mary. One of Graham's cellmates tries to escape with two others but one is a stool pigeon and inadvertently gives away the plan. The guards shoot dead one escapee. Ned Galloway, Graham's other cellmate, vows to avenge this death, planning to murder the informer and warning Graham to stay away from him. However, Graham walks in on the crime. Despite finding him with the body, the warden believes that Graham is not the murderer but knows who is. Promising him parole, the warden demands the name of the killer. Graham remains loyal to the Prisoner's Code of silence so the warden sends him to \"the hole,\" hoping it will change his mind. Mary returns from a trip and is shocked when she finds out Graham has been punished. She proclaims her love for him and urges his release. The warden promises to do so but meanwhile Captain Gleason is putting pressure on Graham to confess. Galloway is grateful that Graham has stayed true and arranges to be sent to the hole and protect him by killing Gleason, for whom he had a longstanding grudge."

The original play by San Francisco Bay Area native author and playwright Martin Flavin was produced on Broadway in 1929 at the Belasco Theater. Boris Karloff, who delivered a strong performance in the stage play, is recast here as Galloway. This film accelerated his career: though appearing in dozens of pictures during the 1920s, he had mostly been cast in bit parts. The Criminal Code was the first of Hawks' four collaborations with Harry Cohn, the others being Twentieth Century (1934), Only Angels Have Wings (1939) and His Girl Friday (1940). It is Hawks' only picture with Frank Fouce, who produced only five films, all released in 1931. Hawks worked with screenwriter Seton Miller several times in the late 1920s and early 1930s. This is the only occasion he worked with Niblo, Jr. Stock footage from the film was used by Columbia in the following year's Behind the Mask, which also featured Cummings and Karloff, but in different roles."

Like other prison films of the 1930s, such as San Quentin (1937) and Each Dawn I Die (1939), The Criminal Code encouraged its viewers to question the contemporary American legal and penal systems. Hawks exploits the prison genre to illustrate the male friendship and 'group as an organic force' themes often present in his works (cf. Only Angels Have Wings, Rio Bravo, 1959). This is most apparent in the scene in which Brady starts his first day of work as warden, greeted by a prison yard full of men booing him as if they were but one man. The warden (and the camera) peer down on them from the office window. Constance Cummings represents the typical strong and stoic Hawksian woman.

He threatens Fat Face and takes his gun, which he uses to wound a Stanfield soldier before setting fire to one of Marlo's cash pickups. Marlo increases the bounty on Omar's head, ends the New Day Co-Op, and ups the wholesale drug price. A wary Slim Charles declines Marlo's offer for control of the Baltimore County territories, which are instead given to Cheese. At the Baltimore Sun, Templeton's reporting on the \"serial killer\" gets national attention, leading editors Whiting and Klebanow to ask for a follow-up article. Templeton spends the night under the Jones Falls Expressway and interviews Terry, a homeless Iraq War veteran with PTSD. Gus is surprised with Templeton's writing, but remains skeptical of his reporting overall. He asks Templeton to pursue a lead on the story of a woman who died from seafood poisoning. When Templeton claims the lead was false, Gus gets more suspicious. McNulty realizes that Templeton made up a few details of his own about the killer. Bunk, thoroughly disgusted with McNulty's behavior, dives back into the old murder cases tied to Marlo's crew. He decides to interview Randy Wagstaff, who remains in his group home, but he refuses to cooperate. Greggs tells Bunk that an informant implicated Marlo's crew for her triple homicide. They learn that evidence from the vacant murders has become irrevocably jumbled due to human error. Bunk then investigates the killing of Bug's father and interviews Michael's mother. He is given a folder of stolen grand jury indictments found in Proposition Joe's shop. Meanwhile, Mayor Carcetti hosts a ribbon-cutting ceremony for portside condos while being heckled by ex-dockworkers, including Nick Sobotka. Later, Carcetti gives a press conference vowing to protect the homeless from the \"serial killer.\" Wilson and Steinhorf suggest that running on defending the homeless may be Carcetti's key to getting elected governor. Daniels hands the stolen indictments to Pearlman and Bond, who realize there is a leak in the courthouse. Judge Daniel Phelan declines McNulty and Pearlman's request for a wiretap on the Sun's phones. Freamon reveals his illegal wiretap of Marlo to Sydnor, who agrees to help. He determines that Marlo is sending photos, but a new wiretap authorization is needed to see what is being sent. McNulty finds that, with police now arriving on the scene immediately whenever a homeless person turns up dead, he is unable to stage more serial murders. He comes across a mentally ill homeless man named Larry and, with Freamon's help, photographs him with the \"killer\"'s trademark ribbon, after which Larry will never be seen again; the killer, according to the cover story, will now only send photos of his victims to the press, and their bodies will not be found. McNulty gives Larry $100 and drives him down to a homeless shelter in Richmond, Virginia, giving him a stolen ID card. As he leaves, he feels a pang of guilt over what he has done to Larry."

The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) finds himself lonely and wanting a relationship after breaking up with Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin). While looking through an office-supplies catalog, he falls in love with a chair model. Meanwhile, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) fight to reclaim lost parking spaces, and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) tells Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) that he is going to propose. The final scene was originally going to be a parody of \"Candle in the Wind\" by Elton John, but John refused permission. The scene was then re-written to feature a parody of the song \"American Pie\" by Don McLean. \"Chair Model\" received mostly positive reviews from critics, although some fans were alienated due to the dark nature of the storyline.

As a result, he decides to resume dating with the help of the office employees, even going so far as threatening to fire them if they do not help. No one in the office wants to set up any of their friends with Michael, but when Michael learns that the chair model had died in a car crash some time ago, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) takes pity and sets him up on a blind date with her landlady (Brooke Dillman). The date does not go well, beginning with Michael pretending he is not who she was supposed to be meeting. After Michael admits his own blind date was a failure, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) convinces him that he needs closure on this person he loved who is gone. The two end up in a cemetery at the grave of the chair model, where Michael \"grieves\". They are both singing \"American Pie\" by Don McLean and dancing on her grave. With Michael busy, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) work to reclaim parking spaces that they have lost due to the parkings of construction workers working in a neighboring office. They arrange a meeting with the bosses of the office park, and are given the parking spots back. Kevin feels happy to have won his space back, as his fianc\u00e9e Stacy broke off their engagement and it's been a hard time for him. While flirting, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) drops a hint about proposing to Pam, even going as far as telling her that he is not going to do it at work (\"because that would be rather lame\") and when he does it, it will \"kick her ass\". Pam is not sure if he's joking. Alone with the camera, Jim reveals that he was not joking and shows an engagement ring that he bought \"the week after [they] started dating.\" After work, while walking back to his car, he stops and gets down on one knee. When Pam stops and looks he says he has a question to ask her. After a second or so of hesitation, he asks her if she will wait while he ties his shoes. She laughs and they continue walking hand in hand.  At the end of the episode, Michael and Dwight are seen singing \"American Pie\" and dancing in the same cemetery at night, having never left."

J. Novak, who plays temporary worker turned corporate manager Ryan Howard. Novak was originally going to name the episode \"Michael Dating\", but the title could have potentially been a spoiler because fans with DVRs would have seen it before \"Dinner Party\" aired and deduced that Michael and Jan's relationship had completely fallen apart. For a while, \"Parking\" was going to be the title, but even that was decided against because that refers to the subplot, and also because it was generic and boring even by the show's no-frills-titles standard. Eventually, someone suggested \"Chair Model\", which was eventually kept as the name. Originally, Novak wrote Jim putting Dwight through a \"phony management training\", but NBC pointed out that it felt like the writers had done it before even though they had not. As a group, the writers tried to think of a new idea for the plot; they considered having Pam move in with Jim, but they thought that first the two should be engaged.<ref name=\"NPR\">{{cite web |author=Pashman, Dan |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/bryantpark/2008/05/the_offices_bj_novak_uncut.html |title=The Office'''s BJ Novak: Uncut |access-date=July 7, 2008 |publisher=NPR |date=May 12, 2008}}</ref> There was an auditioning process for both the chair model and the young blond woman that Michael sees in the coffee shop. According to Novak, the chair model was supposed to be \"pretty\" and \"perhaps even prettier than your average model\", but more of just an \"average single girl\", because the episode is more about Michael wanting to start dating again than the model herself.  In the scene with the \"Five Families\", one of the actors, Paul Faust was the only first-time actor. Faust is the cousin of writer Paul Lieberstein, and had been on a tour of the set and talked to many of the writers. He made a good impression and so the character of \"Cool Guy Paul\" was based on him. The day before they were scheduled to shoot, the show still had not cast anyone for the role, so they called Paul in New York City and had him read the lines into a camera and e-mail to them. In less than an hour, Faust had landed the part and was flown out to Los Angeles. Although Novak wrote the majority of the episode, Jennifer Celotta and Paul Lieberstein were actually the ones that came up with the graveyard scene in the end. The original song for Michael to sing was going to be a parody of \"Candle in the Wind\" by Elton John. Elton John however, refused to give The Office permission to use the song, because 30 Rock had requested permission for a parody of \"Candle in the Wind\" that offended Elton John, and he did not want to have his song parodied again. So then, the writers wrote parodies of \"Legs\" by ZZ Top and \"Ruby Tuesday\" by The Rolling Stones, but eventually \"American Pie\" by Don McLean cleared, so the writers went with that."

He also enjoyed the maturation of Andy, describing him as \"coming into his own [and becoming] something more than just a foil for Dwight\". M. Giant of Television Without Pity awarded the episode an \"A\". BuddyTV senior writer Oscar Dahl wrote that \"The Office is sharp as ever\" and Jim saying he was going to propose was \"a big time moment in the Jim/Pam story\". Dahl also praised the parking lot storyline, saying \"what started as merely a joke (Kevin was dumped), became a feel-good moment.\" IGN's Travis Fickett said that Michael falling in love with the chair model was \"a hysterical turn and highlights just how deluded Michael \u2013 and Dwight \u2013 can be\". Fickett was critical of the \"parking\" storyline, saying that it was \"a bit over the top and runs a bit thin\", but he did think that the scene at the end with Kevin was \"a sweet and genuine moment\". Aubry D'Arminio of Entertainment Weekly'' stated that, in relation to the previous episode \"Dinner Party\", \"Last night's show took another approach. Don't get me wrong. It was a blinder\u2014but a totally different animal, so to speak.\" D'Arminio went on to praise the dual plots of the episode."

Mimi and her father are in the audience on opening night and feel insulted. She goes backstage and tries to get Gary to take the skit out of the show. He refuses and calls her a \"bad sport\". Shocked by the remark, Mimi decides to make a date with Gary. They spend the entire evening together and, by morning, have fallen in love. He finally agrees to revise the skit so it can no longer hurt the Carraways. Mona is in love with Gary and is furious when she hears about Gary's date with Mimi. When the Carraways appear to see the revised sketch, she changes it, without Gary's knowledge, making it worse than before. The Carraways decide to file suit against Gary. To get back at him, Mimi buys the show from the producer and embarrasses Gary by hiring a paid audience to walk out on the show. Word leaks out to the press and makes Gary the laughingstock of New York. Furious, he tears up his contract, refusing to work with Mimi. Soon, Mimi becomes engaged to Arctic explorer Frederick Sims. On her wedding day, Mona arrives and tells Mimi that she, not Gary, changed the skit. Mimi runs out of the wedding and goes to city hall with Gary to be married. The film's action is interspersed with songs from the play, including Berlin's songs \"He Ain't Got Rhythm,\" and \"Let's Go Slumming On Park Avenue.\""

The arrogant brawler Cord (Jeff Cooper) defeats every opponent, but he is disqualified for fighting dishonorably. Cord decides to follow the eventual winner, Morthond (Anthony de Longis), hoping that he can lead Cord to Zetan. While the two fighters are resting, a blind flutist (Carradine) walks by them and into a nearby building. Cord follows the blind man and sees him easily dispatch a gang of thugs who attack him. Impressed by his fighting skills, Cord asks the blind man to be his teacher. The blind man refuses, but Cord follows him anyway. Cord becomes frustrated with the way the blind man teaches his lessons in riddles, and they soon part ways. Cord finds Morthond wounded from the first trial. Morthond asks Cord to help him end his suffering and pursue his quest to find Zetan. Cord does, and he faces a tribe of monkey men whose leader, the Monkeyman (Carradine), is a great fighter. Cord challenges and eventually overcomes the Monkeyman, who then tells him how to find his second trial. On the way, Cord encounters a man in a large cauldron of oil (Wallach) who is attempting to dissolve the lower half of his body. The man is hoping to end his sexual urges to find enlightenment. He invites Cord to join him, but Cord immediately leaves. Cord then comes upon a band of travelers holding a festival. Cord meets with their leader, Chang-Sha (Carradine), who offers to let Cord sleep with one of his wives, Tara (Erica Creer). Cord declines due to his vow of celibacy. However, he challenges Chang-Sha to combat. The contest is set for the following day. During the night, Cord is joined in his tent by Tara. They make love, and Cord asks Tara to stay with him forever. The next morning when Cord awakes, he finds that the entire band has left, and that Tara has been crucified. Resuming his journey, Cord has a vision of Death (Carradine), but he dispels the spirit by demonstrating his lack of fear. While trying to find Chang-Sha, Cord reaches an oasis, where he again meets the blind man. Cord again asks him to be his teacher; the blind man agrees, and they travel together. Encounters with a poor ferryman, a band of raiders and a spoiled child become opportunities for the blind man to teach an exasperated Cord a few life lessons before they go their separate ways once again. Cord finally finds Chang-Sha and his band. Cord holds himself responsible for Tara's death, but he insists on fighting Chang-Sha to learn the location of Zetan. The fight ends in a draw, but Chang-Sha tells Cord how to find Zetan anyway. Cord reaches the island where Zetan lives. He encounters the sect that protects the book of enlightenment. Cord expects to fight, but Zetan explains that Cord has passed the trials and is entitled to read the book. He even asks Cord to replace him as the new keeper of the book. Opening it, Cord finds that the book's pages are simply mirrors. Zetan explains that there is no book of wisdom, and that enlightenment is found only in oneself. Cord walks off laughing, declining to take Zetan's place, and leaves the island. He rejoins the blind man, who gives Cord his flute, passing on his role of teacher."

The three soldiers are Tom, a world-weary cynical veteran, John, a middle-class educated thinker who despises war and Cliff, an eager soldier who loves his work. All three are highly trained professional killers who, regardless of their own personal thoughts, do not hesitate to perform their duties. Two German soldiers approach the farmhouse and the paratroopers dispatch them both. The second of the enemy attackers is stalked by the paratroopers who virtually toy with their victim before John kills him, finishing the man off up close, although the experience renders him sick. As the three men eat a meal, they are surprised and captured by a third German named Helmut, a paratrooper like themselves. The British soon turn the tables and capture Helmut but the latter, who speaks English, manages to manipulate his captors into keeping him alive. The group leave the house in search of their Sergeant whom they eventually find dead in the woods, his throat cut. The men continue on, trying to find their way back to Allied lines. They come across a farmhouse, where a trio of Germans are sheltering. The paratroopers cautiously approach and shoot them, only to find that the Germans are already dead. After spending the night in the house, the group continues their walk back to the British lines, only to run into a German patrol. In the ensuing battle, all of the Germans are killed but Cliff is fatally wounded. John and Tom reach the frontline, taking their prisoner Helmut with them but nearby British troops mistake them all to be German and open fire, mortally wounding Tom. Both injured themselves, John and Helmut take cover in a muddy ditch. There, John decides to kill Helmut with a small skewer he has always carried with him. Delirious with exhaustion and trauma, John staggers into the open, yelling that he is a pacifist before the British troops open fire again, shooting him dead."

'Critics hated the film, finding in it much the same faults as they identified in The Charge of the Light Brigade'. (Charles Wood wrote the screenplay for both films) 'They were confused by the fact that it was an anti-war film that celebrated some of the values of war and army life. Wood was showing, as he did in The Charge, that war has a complex hold over the minds and imaginations of humans.

The stars Karthik and Radha, while Thiagarajan, Silk Smitha and Kamala Kamesh appear in supporting roles. This film marks the debut of both the lead actors. It follows Vichu, a lower-class Hindu boy, who falls in love with Mary (played by Radha), a Christian girl. How the lovers unite braving all the obstacles, forms the crux of the story. The film portrays subtle hints of power-play in villages and caste and religious barriers that oppress those deemed lower in status. The story and screenplay were written by Manivannan and Bharathiraja, respectively. Bharathiraja provided voice-over for Thiagarajan, while Karthik's voice was dubbed by S. N. Surendar and Radha's voice was dubbed by Anuradha. The cinematography was handled by B. Kannan, and editing was handled by R. Bhaskaran. The music was composed by Ilaiyaraaja. The film was simultaneously shot along with its Telugu version titled Seethakoka Chilaka (1981) where Karthik reprised his role. Alaigal Oivathillai was released on 18 July 1981 to positive reviews, and became a blockbuster at the box office. The film received eight Tamil Nadu State Film Awards.

Then comes Mary, the sister of a rich, influential man David, who returns home a year after pursuing her education in the city. Mary starts learning music from Vichu's mother, and after a series of interesting events, Vichu and Mary fall in love with each other. David's wife Elissy hears about this and strictly forbids Mary from having any dealings with Vichu. However things start getting worse when Vichu and his friends officially ask David for Mary's hand in marriage. Enraged, David thrashes Mary and arranges her wedding with another man. He also violently injures Vichu and tries to kill him. Despite all the odds against them, Vichu assures Mary that just as the waves do not cease, their love for each other will also never cease. How the lovers unite braving all the obstacles is what makes the rest of the movie. During the course of these events, David gets aroused by his maid undressing for her bath and enters her bath hut (which had no door lock) and rapes her, with Elissy's tacit support, when she stood \"guard\" and tried to divert the maid's husband from realizing what was going on, so as to prevent embarrassment and shame to her family. David gets caught red-handed and leaves the scene without a word. The maid's husband enters the bath hut and consoles his violated and weeping wife.  David cleanly gets away with the rape and the maid and her husband, knowing David's power and influence in the village, realize that it was futile to confront him and except for a sarcastic comment, otherwise quietly left without making a scene. Except for Elissy's soft attempts to make him regret while expressing her personal remorse, nothing more was said about the rape, but in a show of hypocrisy, David the rapist himself later proclaims morality and Christian values, in an attempt to prevent his sister Mary from marrying Vichu."

Muriel's husband left her a considerable sum of money, and, despite having been advised not to make any \"big decisions\", she soon agrees to hand over control of the money to their son Giles (who received nothing from the will).

It is implied Margaret's mental illness was the result of sexual molestation by her father. Muriel appears to be aware of this and also begins to wonder if she contributed to her husband's end with \"all those death-dealing breakfasts.\" She is now reduced to using the Meals on Wheels service she had once commanded, and her only entertainments are television and cassette tapes from the library.

Rizvan is set free, and the story sets off in a flashback. Rizvan is shown growing up with his younger brother Zakir and mother Razia in Borivali, Mumbai. His late father, Dilawar Amanatullah Khan, used to work at a repair shop, and the meek Rizvan, who is despised for his autistic condition, has developed an ability to repair things in the process. Despite this, he is shown to possess great talent and determination, including a sharp memory and attention to detail, prompting Razia to take extra care of him. All this leads to a heightened level of jealousy from Zakir, who ultimately leaves his family for a life in the United States. Nevertheless, in the wake of Razia's death, an adult Zakir sponsors Rizwan to come and live with him in San Francisco, where his wife Haseena diagonses Rizvan with Asperger's syndrome, one symptom being his repulsion to yellow. Rizvan begins to work as a salesman for the beauty products company Zakir is highly posted at. During one such visit, he meets Mandira Rathore, a Hindu NRI divorcee with a son, Sameer, from her previous marriage and develops a liking on her. Rizwan manages to impress her and they decided to get married. Despite Zakir's objection to the marriage on account of their religious differences, Rizwan marries her and moves in with Mandira and Sam, next door to the Garricks, comprising Mark and Sarah, whose son Reese is a close friend to Sam. Mandira opens her own beauty parlour and it comes out successful. The Khans' perfect existence gets disrupted after the September 11 attacks. Mark goes to cover the war in Afghanistan and dies there. Mandira begins to suffer losses in her business, and Reese begins to turn against Sam as well. One afternoon an argument between Reese and Sam, wherein the latter is trying to reconcile with the former, turns into a racially motivated fight with older students which catches heat. Sam is killed in the process, and the older students threaten Reese into silence. Shocked beyond belief, Mandira blames Rizvan, stating that Sam \"died only because of his surname.\" She sarcastically says that to be back together, he has to tell the people and President of the United States that \"his name is Khan and he is not a terrorist\". Rizvan, taking her words literally, sets out on a road trip to meet President George W. Bush, even as Mandira employs the services of Detective Garcia to unearth the mystery of Sam's murderers. During the journey, which restores the story to present day, Rizvan tries to check into a motel owned by a Gujarati NRI, Jitesh, who is attacked by some thugs, causing him to leave abruptly. Later, at a bus stop in Wilhelmina, Georgia, he meets an Afro-American teen, Joel, and escorts him back to his home, where his mother, affectionately called Mama Jenny, houses Rizvan; he leaves after staying there for a few days. While at a mosque in Los Angeles, he overhears violent rhetoric from a doctor named Faisal Rahman who is quoting religious texts, angrily defying Faisal's statements before walking out to drop a message for the FBI. As he is waiting in a crowd to meet President Bush, Rizwan aggressively shouts out loud, \"My name is Khan and I am not a terrorist!\", but his cries are misinterpreted by the cops, who detain him, while two Indian student reporters, Raj Burman and Komal Kukreti, end up recording him. Komal initially acts dismissive, but Raj convinces her that there must be a story behind him. Rizwan is interrogated and tortured as a terrorist suspect, but a psychiatrist, Radha, believes he is innocent. Raj and Komal, meanwhile, manage to make it to acclaimed news reporter Bobby Ahuja, who is convinced by their case and decides to make support to Rizvan. Eventually, he is later released after a media campaign by Raj, Komal and Bobby, who claim his innocence by revealing his attempts to inform the FBI about Faisal Rahman. Rizvan's quest is, however, cut short by news reports of a devastating hurricane having hit Wilhelmina, and decides to go there to help Joel and Mama Jenny. Raj, Komal and Bobby track him down, and begin assisting Rizwan in order to rehabilitate everyone. As news of his relief work gains traction and support throughout the nation, Rizvan is joined by many supporters, including Zakir and Haseena, and the town is finally restored to normalcy. Meanwhile, Reese finally meets and opens up to Mandira about the scuffle that claimed Sam's life. She informs Detective Garcia, and the boys, including Reese, are arrested, with Reese attaining a lighter sentence. She eventually reunites with Rizwan, who, during a bonfire for the locals, is stabbed by one of Rahman's followers. Even as Rizvan is hospitalized, President-elect Barack Obama is elected to victory and is slated to address a gathering. Rizvan finally recovers, and Mandira asks him to abandon his plans to meet the President, but Rizvan stands firm. Although he initially believes himself to have been a little too late, Obama returns, and invites Rizvan to the stage, telling him, \"Your name is Khan and you are not a terrorist.\" Rizvan conveys 'Howdy!' from John, fulfilling his promise, and leaves with Mandira as the crowd applauds him."

        "content": "According to director Karan Johar, My Name Is Khan is about a multitude of perspectives of the various opinions, facts, and propaganda that comes with the global issue of discrimination and intolerance towards a race of people completely unassociated with the evils of terrorism. In an August 2009 interview, Shah Rukh Khan stated that My Name Is Khan is \"not about terrorism, or 9/11. It's about a relationship between two people, between an individual and the State, and between an individual and the country. In short, there are the three important components: a love story, Islam, and a mild form of autism.\" In an earlier July 2009 interview, Khan also noted that the film focuses on themes concerning \"the relationship between the Western world and Islam and how that has changed over the past few years.\" He describes the film as about \"the journey of one family and how it changes because of 9/11\" and suggests \"we touch upon that in a very unbiased and educated way.\" In another early interview, he also stated that, \"it's not about a disabled man's fight against disability. It's a disabled man's fight against the disability that exists in the world\u2014terrorism, hatred, fighting ... My Name Is Khan is also about Islam and the way the world looks at Islam but we are not taking any sides. We are only trying to say that there are only good people and bad people. There are no good Hindus, bad Hindus, good Christians, bad Christians. Either you are a good person or a bad person. Religion is not the criterion, humanity is.\" Johar said in an interview with Bollywood Hungama: \"MNIK is an unusual Bollywood film, if at all, and doesn't have those quintessential pre-requisite elements that any Bollywood film has. It's telling a story with a strong message, professing humanity and goodness and putting it out on a big cinematic scale. So all put together it is definitely a different experience for mainstream India ... All I can say is that MNIK is going to open windows and doors to many people who have stories to tell and are shy to put their story on the celluloid\". When asked about comparisons between the film and Kurbaan (2009), noting that both have dealt with similar topics, he added:  \"I'd say that Kurbaan didn't have 'hope', whereas MNIK had 'hope'. Kurbaan was darker, grittier and a grey look at a situation, whereas MNIK is a hopeful, far more positive film with a lot more positivity in its finishing reels with a triumph to the human spirit. Kurbaan was very cinematic and interesting in its approach but it didn't offer a solution. Rather it just tells the problem. MNIK offers you that solution.\""

        "content": "Production of the film took place in India and the United States. Filming began in Los Angeles during December 2008 and one of the locations used was UCLA. Johar next continued production in Mumbai during April 2009. During June 2009, production moved to San Francisco and the Bay Area, where they filmed a key scene at the Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose. Khan and Kajol were cast in the lead roles, reuniting them after Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001). The film faced a temporary setback in late December when actor Aamir Bashir was denied a visa to the United States. He was eventually replaced by Jimmy Sheirgill as Khan's younger brother. Although Shabana Azmi was originally cast as Khan's mother she left the production after his shoulder injury delayed the filming schedule, and was replaced in the role by Zarina Wahab; child actor Tanay Chheda portrayed a younger Rizwan as a child living in the Borivali section of Mumbai. Chheda was chosen because he resembles Khan and because he is recognizable to an international audience after portraying \"middle Jamal\" in Slumdog Millionaire. He had earlier worked with Khan in  Don (2006), while American actor Christopher B. Duncan was chosen to portray President Barack Obama in a special appearance. Duncan is known for his impression of Obama on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Johar had difficulties finding a mosque to film in. According to actor Arif Zakaria, who plays an important minor character, \"I don't know if Karan tried to get permission in Mumbai. But we were to shoot in a mosque in Los Angeles and hard as Karan tried to convince the authorities that his film would not propagate anti-social values, he was denied permission ... We finally shot the two-day scene with Shah Rukh Khan on the set of a mosque constructed at The Club in Andheri.\" Johar also shot for an important scene inside of the studio of CBS 5. San Francisco's Film Commission Director Stephanie Coyote was responsible for giving permission to the crew to shoot in the film studio. While shooting for the film, Khan suffered from severe pain in the neck and headaches which were caused by the expressions and posture of Rizwan Khan. His character in the film who has Asperger syndrome, has a way of jutting his neck out at a particular angle and wears an expression which has his eyebrows raised in every scene. As he would shoot for hours, he'd get severe migraines. Johar admitted that \"Shah Rukh's character Rizwan had to arch his eyebrows and focus his eyes on a certain place before every take. Halfway through the shooting of the film, Shah Rukh developed severe headaches as result of all the pressure it would put on his head so he had to see a neurosurgeon for that.\" After filming in Los Angeles was completed, Johar stated that \"in all my 11 years as a filmmaker, I've never felt the experience to be so different. The content of My Name Is Khan is diametrically opposite to whatever I've done in the past.\" He described working with both Khan and Kajol again as \"magic. They build an inexplicable energy on screen.\" Johar also stated that he was \"blown away by Shah Rukh who had done monumental research on his autistic character in the film. I was zapped by how much he knew about the subject.\" Johar also asked Khan to co-produce the film under his production company, Red Chillies Entertainment. Talking about the initiative, he said: We were both passionate about the subject, we said why not co-produce the film? We've known each other so long ... that this new initiative is just an extension of our emotions. Besides, I can never make a film without Shah Rukh."

The first look of My Name Is Khan unveiled at a grand function at Mumbai by Johar, Khan and Kajol and was then beamed across 70 countries worldwide on the Star TV Network. Johar was excited and noted, \"This is a first in the history of Bollywood \u2013 that the promos of a film will play across such a wide platform. And, this has mainly been made possible because of our synergy with Fox Star Studios ... and also the first time a Bollywood company is tying up with a mainstream Hollywood studio. So, there are many firsts to this venture.\" The trailer of the film was released at the premiere of the Hollywood film, Avatar (2009). My Name Is Khan marked the first instance of a film using the roadblock advertising technique to market a film, in which the three-minute trailer was aired on all leading television channels simultaneously. The makers of the film made various brand tie-ups to for the promotion of the film. Dish TV entered into a strategic marketing alliance with Fox Star and spent approximately  in a month-long 360-degree integrated marketing campaign which ran across all India to co-promote the brand and the film. Reebok created an entire MNIK Footwear and Apparel Collection to promote the film. On 1 February 2010, Khan and Kajol became the first Indian film stars to ring the opening bell of the New York stock exchange NASDAQ. They were invited by Fox Searchlight Pictures to do so as part of their promotion for My Name Is Khan. Khan also appeared on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross as part of its promotion in the UK, becoming only the second Indian after Shilpa Shetty to do so."

Jha (film critic and author of The Essential Guide to Bollywood) gave My Name Is Khan a rave review arguing that Rizwan Khan \"repairs almost anything, including irreparably damaged relationships. But this film about damaged lives needs no repairing. My Name Is Khan is a flawless work, as perfect in content, tone and treatment as any film can get ... My Name Is Khan is no ordinary film. Long after the wary-of-physical-touch Rizwan has finally shaken hands with President Obama, long after the heat and dust of racial and communal hatred has settled down the core of humanism that the film secretes stays with you. Yes, we finally know what they mean by a feelgood film.\" Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India also gave it five stars, describing My Name Is Khan as, \"indubitably one of the most meaningful and moving films to be rolled out from the Bollywood mills in recent times.\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave My Name Is Khan four and a half out of five stars and argues, \"When a film stars two of the finest talents of the country, you expect nothing but the best. SRK, well, how does one describe his performance? To state that this is his best work so far would be cutting short the praise he truly deserves ... Kajol is pure dynamite and casting her for this character was the most appropriate decision. No other actress could've matched SRK in histrionics the way Kajol has. In fact, SRK and Kajol complement each other wonderfully well and this film only proves it yet again. It's a powerhouse performance from this supremely talented actress.\" Sarita Tanwar of Mid-Day gave the film four and a half out of five stars and described it as \"near-perfect\", concluding that \"The Karan-Shah Rukh-Kajol combo strikes once more.\" Raja Sen of Rediff.com gave a 3.5 out of 5 star rating explaining that \"Reference points aside, My Name Is Khan is a film that will have the galleries cheering and making sure there aren't many dry eyes in the house. The applause will ring wild and while many might complain that Johar has simply ditched old movie cliches for more American ones, none can argue that the segue seems surprisingly seamless.\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave My Name Is Khan three and a half out of five stars, arguing that \"the film shamelessly tugs at your heartstrings and on more than one occasion wallops you to weep. Aided by solid camerawork, tight editing and a layered story, Johar crafts an engaging, stirring saga that is earnest and noble. With this message movie in the mainstream format, the director takes a step in the right direction.\" Sudhish Kamath from The Hindu wrote, \"My Name Is Khan is populist, yet layered with rich political subtext. It's all about types, yet every character feels real. It's about generalisations and yet it chooses to dwell on the specifics. It's all heart and spirit that you can't help but overlook the flaws and admire it.\" According to BBC critic Manish Gajjar, who gave the film four out of five stars, the film is \"a fiction-based film refreshingly told with realism of racial profiling on American soil. It's a rare treat for Hindi commercial cinema and a crossover audience.\" Pratim D. Gupta from The Telegraph in a positive review concluded, \"My Name Is Khan has conscience and courage and two heartfelt performances. It can try your patience a bit but it will not leave you untouched.\" Namrata Joshi from Outlook, giving the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, described it as \"a gentle, affecting and heart-warming film that makes you smile through your tears.

Skilfully directed by Karan Johar and with an evocative score by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, Khan jerks tears with ease, while teaching lessons about Islam and tolerance.\" According to Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter, My Name Is Khan is, \"a film that delves compellingly into Americans' anti-Muslim hysteria\" as it tackles \"a subject American movies have mostly avoided \u2013 that of racial profiling and the plight of Muslim-Americans. It also allows Shah Rukh Khan to display his talent to an even wider audience. It's well worth the 162-minute journey.\" Jay Wesissberg of Variety describes My Name Is Khan as a \"riotously overstuffed and enormously enjoyable drama\" with \"confident camerawork [which] is matched by exceptional production design\" He also states that Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol are a \"delight together and her natural warmth makes the relationship even more believable.\" My Name Is Khan was not India's official entry to the Oscars as Best Foreign Language Film, but it was eligible for other nominations at the 83rd Academy Awards."

The lyrics are penned by Niranjan Iyengar. The audio rights of the film were purchased by Sony Music Entertainment, which had also previously released music for all of Johar's past releases, which gained global musical success. The album was released on 1 January 2010. The musical soundtrack consists of 6 original songs and 4 bonus tracks that are taken from Johar's previous successful films featuring Khan. The soundtrack includes one instrumental called \"Khan Theme\", composed by Indrajit Sharma and the strings for the song are performed by the Bombay Film Orchestra. The songs such as \"Noor-e-Khuda\" blend western bar blues and techno sounds with Indian classical styles such as Sufi and Hindustani. The song \"Allah hi Rahem\" sung by Ustad Rashid Khan is another example of Sufi thematic song. The soundtrack is thus representative of the \"indie fusion genre\". Unlike all of Johar's other films, none of the songs plays in lip-sync format, instead playing in the background. Although Iyengar is alone credited for writing the lyrics for the songs, he penned the only two Sufi songs in the film, \"Sajda\" and \"Allah Hi Rahem\". Shankar\u2013Ehsaan\u2013Loy's previous collaborator Javed Akhtar was approached to write the lyrics for the remaining three songs. Earlier, it was reported that Akhtar refused to write lyrics because he did not want to share credits with another lyricist. Later, Johar confirmed that Akhtar penned the remaining songs, but did not want to be credited as lyricist when the soundtrack released. Akhtar confirmed this and said, \"I don't like to share the credits. I would have got the publicity but the other person, who has done a fine job, wouldn't have. I have read the songs penned by Niranjan and I think he has done a great job.\""

He added: 'Shah Rukh Khan, the actor and global icon, is a welcome guest in the United States.'\" Khan said he was told that it was because \"they said my name was common to some name that popped up on the computer.\" The officials asked if he could provide names of people to vouch for him. Khan noted that he \"had all the documents; they were asking me where I was going to be staying. I gave the name of FOX people with whom I had finalised a deal a few days ago as contacts.\" However, because they wanted to check his luggage which the airline had lost, Khan said that he \"was taken to a room where many people were awaiting a secondary check on visa, most were South Asians. In fact many officers were reluctantly vouching for me, some people were asking for autographs and a Pakistani fan even said he knew who I was. But the officers said it was procedure and kept taking numbers from me.\" While he was not allowed to use his own phone, Khan was permitted one phone call. He was thus released after officials from the Indian Consulate intervened. Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel stated that the event will be further explored with U.S. officials. According to the BBC, \"Elmer Camacho, a spokesman for the US Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, said the questioning was part of the agency's routine process to screen foreign travellers.\" When asked if he would demand an apology, Khan replied that he would not. The director of My Name Is Khan, Karan Johar, was asked during an August 2009 interview with Mid-Day if the event was a publicity stunt for the film. Johar denied that it was and responded: \"It's upsetting because I got a text message this morning asking me if it was a publicity plug for my movie. (Sarcastically) I mean, if I had that much power over the Homeland Security, why would I allow Shah Rukh to go through something like this? ... What's really shocking is the fact that when I was writing the film, I never thought that what happened to the protagonist of the film would happen to Shah Rukh.\" During a January 2010 interview, Khan referred to the implication that the event was a publicity stunt for the film as \"lowdown and cheap.\" Christopher B. Duncan, who portrays President Obama in My Name Is Khan, also commented on the incident stating: \"I was very disappointed with what SRK experienced at the airport. We're living in times where the levels of fear can sometimes spill over into paranoia. Here's a man who is an international superstar, being detained for an excessive amount of time at an airport in the United States. It had to be very upsetting for him. Imagine Oprah (Winfrey) being detained at an airport in India for a long time, during a kind of interrogation.\" In addition, the incident sparked debate and commentary among Indian politicians, actors, and others. It also led to demonstrations in India. California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger later invited Khan to have dinner with him \"in a bid to diffuse what has become a slight diplomatic row.\" In another event, on 5 February 2010, while promoting My Name Is Khan on the British talk show Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, Khan claimed that female security staff at Heathrow Airport in London had printed a naked image of him taken using the newly installed body scanner that he was asked to go through. He said that he autographed it for them, though it is not clear if his comments were intended as a joke. In relation to Khan's comments, The Economic Times has raised concerns over the new body scanners and the possibilities of it being abused to distribute naked pictures of celebrities. His comments have restarted the debate in Britain over whether the new scanners violate individual privacy."

        "content": "After Shah Rukh Khan (who owns the Kolkata Knight Riders cricket team) criticised the fact that members of the Pakistani Cricket Team were not bought by the clubs competing in the 2010 Indian Premier League (IPL), he was condemned by Shiv Sena, a Hindu nationalist political party. There were consequent protests and demonstrations against him and demands that cinemas in India refuse to screen My Name Is Khan. Khan responded by stating, \"What did I say that was wrong? All I said was that I wanted people to come to my country.\" Khan continued by stating that: \"I have no idea what I am supposed to apologise for ... If I am in the wrong I would like to apologise but someone needs to explain to me what is wrong.\" He also stated that he does \"not want any confrontation. I am trying to explain myself on every platform ... I have not said anything that is anti-national.\" Khan said that he was willing to meet with Bal Thackeray to discuss the issue. Initially, Shiv Sena rescinded its demand to block release of My Name Is Khan after it was announced that Khan would be allowed to release it \"in as many theatres\" as he would like. However, on 17 February 2010, when cinemas opened for advanced bookings, individuals disguised as \"cinegoers\" began to attack cinemas and booking centres. Director Karan Johar and distributors met with police to ask for additional security. In response, Chief Minister of Maharashtra Ashok Chavan threatened to withdraw security cover for party leader Uddhav Thackeray. Later, some security was withdrawn and the Maharashtra government has \"called in five battalions of the State Reserve Police Force to protect 63 cinemas in the city that will screen the film directed by Karan Johar from this Friday.\" There were multiple arrests and leave of all police officials were cancelled. The distributor, Fox Star, stated that the film would still be released on its scheduled opening date, 12 February. It opened to full cinema houses across India."

In the town of Yellow Ridge, however, he is detained by a seductive dance hall girl named Trixie (Glaum). Also known as \"the firefly,\" Trixie not only cheats him out of his gold, but also conceals a message that was wired to him by his dying mother. Learning the next day that his mother is dead, Denton is infuriated about being cheated and betrayed by Trixie, who pretended to be good, and other false friends. In his rage, he kills Trixie's lover, Chip Emmett (Mayall), and kidnaps her. Dragging her by the hair of her head, he takes her into the desert. Enslaving Trixie in his desert hideaway, Denton turns his back on \"white civilization.\" He hates all white men and women and assumes the leadership of a band of Indian and Mexican bandits. Two years later, a wagon train of Mississippi farmers who are lost and dying in the desert appeal to Denton for help. He refuses to assist them. He is secretly visited that night by Mary Jane Garth (Love), an innocent and virtuous young woman among the migrants who bravely confronts the Indians and Mexicans. She pleads their cause and expresses her belief that no white man would refuse to protect a woman in distress. Deeply moved, Denton is redeemed. He guides the wagon train out of the desert and then resumes his wanderings."

Gardner Sullivan in which the hero had, according to Hart, \"no motive for his hardness.\" He argued that the audience needed an explanation. Sullivan preferred the idea that his ruthless personality was simply a given, but eventually accepted Hart's wishes. Although it was made during the silent era, Sullivan wrote long speeches for the actors to perform, which were filmed and later edited down. Hart wanted Mae Marsh for the role as Mary Jane, but Marsh was working on a D. W. Griffith movie at the time. Griffith recommended a new actress, Bessie Love. The movie was made at the height of Hart's career, but was unusual because he played a ruthless individual described as \"hard as flint.\" As the title suggests, the movie draws on racial ideologies of the era. Hart stated that the central character, Steve Denton, was \"a white man, who, foreswearing his race, makes outlaw Mexicans his comrades and allows white women to be attacked by them.\" The film was made at Inceville and Sulphur Canyon."

Involved by accident in a street fight, he rescues the wallet of the owner of an Antalya luxury hotel and hitchhikes his way south to restore it to the rightful owner. Along the way he is made the object of an unlikely attempted seduction by a homosexual truck-driver, reacting with shock and innocence. Reaching the hotel to hand over the wallet, he begins his stay by shattering a porcelain vase in the hotel lobby and talks his way out of the situation in exactly the same way as earlier burlesque characters. After giving back the wallet, he is about to leave when he glimpses his childhood sweetheart Sibel (Fatma Topta\u015f) among a party of arriving guests and decides to take up the owner's offer of a free stay in the hotel. G\u00f6kbakar then uses \u0130vedik to burlesque every aspect of five star hotel life. Unable to use the toilets, he pees in the ornamental flowers, drinks the hotel shampoo as well as the contents of the minibar, massages the foot of an amorous woman in mistake for Sibel's, gatecrashes  women's morning fitness exercises on the beach in a ludicrous purple gown, and cuffs the heads of almost everyone who comes into contact with him. All the while he pours out a stream of inappropriate invective and obscenities. By the close of the film most middle class conventions have also been shattered, a high point being a burping contest between him and Sibel. Sibel, who is resisting her bourgeois mother's attempts to marry her off to a fiance she does not love, contains a very mild criticism of the middle class lifestyles and attitudes with which \u0130vedik is colliding. By making a sweet nice girl like Sibel belch at full volume, G\u00f6kbakar comes closest to an outright repudiation of middle class values. The film ends with \u0130vedik leaving the hotel. Has catharsis been achieved? No. \u0130vedik departs more or less exactly as he arrived, presumably en route to more adventures in his next film. Yet somehow he ends up by being not so much frightening as slightly loveable\u2014no doubt because he no longer appears wholly dangerous. It is Sibel's view of him which has changed\u2014and that of the film audience too."

Chicago socialite Cynthia Drexel sees Allen perform in a production of Gounod's Faust and makes a bet with her longtime suitor, the Count Raul du Rienne: either she can make the notoriously unavailable Allen sing at a private party, or else she will marry him. After the show, Drexel makes a deal with Petroff, offering him $15,000 ($288,187 in 2021 dollars) as a fee for his appearance at a private party. Not knowing of this new arrangement, Allen is especially insulted by one final publicity stunt, fires Petroff, and flees with devoted manservant Botts, first to his hometown in New Mexico, then to his secluded cabin in the Sierra Madres. Neither Petroff nor Botts can convince him to return to his life as a public figure, forcing Drexel to set out in her own private plane to find him. Drexel confronts Allen in the Sierra Madres, where she fails to convince him to return, but does attract his romantic interest. The two spend a tense but romantically charged weekend together, until a misunderstanding compels Cynthia to hastily leave. Now intrigued, Allen returns to Chicago with her belongings. He finds Drexel furious; she criticizes his singing and (falsely) tells him she has no romantic interest in him, as she is engaged to Count Du Rienne. Cynthia sues him for breach of contract, but in court Anthony argues that he refused to sing for her because of her lack of appreciation for his talent, and the case is dismissed. Drexel and Allen, each of whom have realized the depth of their feelings for each other, arrange to meet outside the courtroom. Allen conceals himself in a doorway, and when Drexel walks by, he pulls her inside and proceeds to viciously spank her. They emerge a happy couple. Petroff calls a press conference at which he announces their union, and the couple signs their marriage license."

        "content": "Otto Preminger had been working as an apprentice at 20th Century Fox for nearly eight months when studio head Darryl F. Zanuck assigned him to the film, a remake of the Spanish language release Las fronteras del amor, which Frank R. Strayer had directed for Fox two years earlier. Zanuck had opera baritone Lawrence Tibbett under contract, and following the commercial failure of the high-budget Metropolitan in 1935, he was anxious to rid himself of the singer and thought Preminger could serve as his hatchet man. Tibbett was aware of Zanuck's feelings and didn't blame the director, who was anxious to helm a film, for accepting the assignment, and he proved to be amiable both on and off the set. Filming began under the title Love Flight in mid-August 1936, soon after Preminger filed his Declaration of Intention to become a naturalized American citizen. Well under budget and ahead of schedule, principal photography was completed on September 15, and Zanuck was so pleased with Preminger's efficiency he signed him to a one-year contract at $1,000 per week, effective October 6. Prior to the film's release, its title was changed to Under Your Spell, after one of three songs Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz had written for the score, the other two being \"My Little Mule Wagon\" and \"Amigo.\" Tibbet also performed \"Largo al factotum\" from The Barber of Seville and \"Le veau d'or\" from Faust in the film, which proved to be his last. The film opens with a lengthy tracking shot in a recording studio that established Preminger's preference for allowing camera movement to bind together all the elements of a scene. In another sequence, set during a trial, the director presaged his 1959 film Anatomy of a Murder with his use of loud, overlapping dialogue to create a sense of courtroom reality."

A motorist notices the zombie walking along a deserted road, picks it up, and dies in an accident moments later. The zombie recovers from the crash, and reanimates the driver by penetrating a wound in the man's chest with its monstrous penis. The ghouls have sex, which ends with the first zombie ejaculating black semen, and stumbling away as the motorist sits among the wreckage of his vehicle, in awe of what has just transpired. The zombie reaches Los Angeles, and after perusing shopping carts full of discarded objects, ventures to the L.A. River, where it sees a white collar criminal being shot to death by his partner. The zombie drags the deceased lawbreaker to a soiled mattress, and resurrects him via coitus with the bullet wounds in the man's back. The undead criminal and the zombie have sex, which is followed by the zombie wandering away, washing itself, and going to a caf\u00e9, where it purchases a cup of coffee. The zombie steals some clothing, and finds the dumped body of a gang member who was shot in the head. The zombie brings the hood back to life by molesting the hole in his forehead, and has sex with him. A group of homeless are then shown meeting at an abandoned sofa, but flee when they discover the body of a fellow bum who had overdosed in a cardboard box. The zombie stumbles upon the scene, and after ignoring a homeless man who is merely passed out, resurrects and engages in sex with the dead one. In a BDSM dungeon, four men have an orgy, and later all of them are killed by a pair of drug dealers when they refuse to pay for low-quality cocaine. The zombie witnesses the massacre through a window, enters the building, and instigates a gory circle jerk after bringing back the shot leathermen. The zombie then goes to a cemetery, cries tears and blood as it reminisces about its lovers, and digs up a grave as it begins to storm."

Zombie', 'Pietro']\", Variety.com. Retrieved on June 23, 2010.</ref> The film was due to have its second and third screening as part of the Melbourne International Film Festival (MIFF) in Australia on August 7 and 8, 2010. However, the Australian Film Classification Board advised festival organisers that the film could not be screened as it was likely to be refused classification. Under Australian law, films that are refused classification may not be imported, sold, or distributed, which precludes screening at public events. In defiance of this censorship, the Melbourne Underground Film Festival, which occurs concurrently with MIFF but screens films regarded as too controversial for the mainstream event, held an illegal screening of L.A. Zombie on August 29. While police did not attend or stop the screening on the night, they did raid the home of director Richard Wolstencroft on the morning of November 11, 2010. Wolstencroft admitted to police that an August 29 screening had occurred, but claimed to have destroyed the only copy of the film afterwards. The court ruled that he pay $750 to the Royal Children's Hospital. L.A. Zombie held its UK premiere at the Raindance Film Festival in London on October 1, 2010. It was reported that \"at least one-third of the audience walked out stupefied\". TLA Releasing picked up the U.S. release for the film, and set November 12, 2010 as the DVD date. The DVD release is an uncut version, longer than the film festival release's runtime. In New Zealand, the film was first screened at the Out Takes LGBT film festival in Auckland and Wellington. Unlike Australia, New Zealand's Office of Film and Literature Classification gave the film an R18 certificate, which means that it can be screened as long as the audience is aged eighteen and over. The Society for Promotion of Community Standards called for review of the decision, while GayNZ.com welcomed its release. SPCS failed to have the film prohibited after the review and it was resultantly screened at the Out Takes film festival in Auckland and Wellington in early June 2011. Reception Fangoria referred to L.A. Zombie as a \"strangely introspective indie film\", and concluded that it was well done and thoughtful, and that \"The joy of the film is that it doesn't do what you expect it to, yet it always seems sincere\". Film Forward stated \"This sometimes sexy, sometimes chilling horror-porn-art house piece has a strong message, yet it feels like Bruce LaBruce light. There's none of the raw energy that made The Raspberry Reich (2004) a revelation, and there's not enough of the thought-provoking, satirical humor that embodied his last one, Otto; or Up with Dead People (2008). According to Variety, rather than combining art-show, campy horror, and porn movies, LaBruce \"just turned out a confused mess\", and \"it's hard to imagine regular filmgoers being especially disturbed...only the most sheltered viewers will feel the notoriety is deserved.\" A score of two stars out of five was awarded by Moria, which wrote \"One suspects the true purpose behind L.A. Zombie is that Bruce LaBruce is less a pornographic filmmaker than a gleeful agitator who latches onto pornography solely for its outrage value\". Next Projection gave the film 6 out of 10 stars or \"okay\" rating. The Torontoist found the film exploitative of L.A.'s homeless, giving it zero stars and beginning its review with \"A spiritless, pointless amalgam of gory zombie picture and hardcore porn, L.A. Zombie is the confluence of two cultural crosscurrents that nobody asked for. Shot on crummy-looking digital and realized by the incompetent Bruce LaBruce, it looks like a homework assignment cranked out by the insufferably pretentious kid in the Tom Savini master class\"."

They concluded that overall, American Yakuza \"is a surprisingly powerful portrayal of the loyalties that exist in the underworld, where violence and betrayal are a way of life.\" Reviewer Anton Bitel wrote after considering Viggo Mortensen's acting in this 1993 film, and how he is better remembered now as Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings films, this one \"will leave viewers wondering why Mortensen's talents were not generally recognized a lot earlier.\"  He also notes that one of the film's ironies is that when the Mafia takes on the Yakuza in the film and \"boast of their 'American drive and know-how'\", they forget the similarities in that a century earlier they were just as eager as the Yakuza \"to get a foothold in this country\".  Bitel feels that \"American Yakuza is in effect 'The Godfather: the next Generation' \u2013 an immigrant saga of family, blood and assimilation that just happens to be set in the world of organized crime.\"  He found flaws in that parts of the film \"have the look of a rock video\" and overall suffers from needing a larger budget. He concludes with praise for the acting, twisting plotline, and the carefully restrained violence."

Convinced he is a great writer, Brian attempts to gain the family's interest but fails to do so, they even callously disregard him. Once he arrives at the \"award ceremony\" however, he discovers that he has misunderstood the meaning of the word \"special\",  prompting him to drown his sorrows at the local bar and realize that he is not a good writer. He drives home drunk that night and accidentally runs over and kills a dog. He secretly buries the dead dog's body outside the Griffins' home and tries to keep quiet about it. Stewie, having witnessed his deed, begins to toy with Brian's guilt, eventually driving him to a state where he decides to confess to \"murder\". However, when he confesses to Joe and the Griffin family, they all laugh, saying that no one cares if a dog or any other animal is killed, especially by another animal. Outraged, Brian starts a support group, and decides to call it \"The Quahog Animal Equal Rights League\", to convince the town that the lives of animals should be of equal value to humans'. As the town citizens learn more about it, however, none of them are keen on changing their lifestyles if it means no processed meats and medical research on animals, and even become interested in how dogs taste after Brian mentions they are eaten in some cultures. Refusing to listen any further, they chase after Brian in an attempt to eat him. Brian realizes that if no one cares about the lives of animals, then he is worthless to the Griffin family and everyone else. Stewie finds Brian crying in the bathtub, and, seeing how upset Brian is and feeling sorry for him, Stewie successfully fakes his death by putting his collar (which Brian hadn't been wearing) on a stray and killing it in a liquor store fire. The Griffins are devastated upon learning about Brian's supposed death, and realize how close a friend he was to them. Seeing this, Stewie rushes upstairs to show Brian how much the Griffins still care about him, regardless of his species. Brian then realizes his life does have a purpose and thanks Stewie for helping him, and decides to remain hidden to let the Griffins grieve a little longer. Meanwhile, Quagmire accidentally knocks over a carton of Kool-Aid mix on the kitchen floor of the Griffin's house and leaves Peter to take the blame. Frustrated with having to clean Peter's messes, Lois hires a Hispanic maid named Consuela to clean their house. But Consuela quickly proves to be very stubborn, refusing to leave after her work hours and sleeping at the Griffins' house overnight, much to Peter and Lois' annoyance. They try to fire her and even bribe her to leave, but she still refuses (though she takes the money they offer her anyway). In a last-ditch attempt, Peter finally gets rid of her by tricking her into inhaling chloroform on a handkerchief, and leaves her in a basket on Joe's front porch. At the end, Peter lets the viewers know that everyone at Family Guy respects all living beings and assures the viewers that no animals were harmed in the making of the episode, but they are going hurt the feelings of an Italian opera singer by prematurely dropping the curtain on his performance - this is then shown onscreen."

Later, after going to the bar to drink, Brian talks to Bill, the father from The Family Circus syndicated comic strip. After Bill tells him he should have tried harder on writing his book, Brian responds by yelling that all Bill does is \"judge\" other people, and demands for him to go home and \"fuck [his] wife in the face\", to which Bill agrees. This is also later recognized by Peter the next day, when he is seen reading the funnies, and murmurs to himself, \"this is a very shocking Family Circus.\" News anchor and political commentator Chris Matthews' show entitled Hardball with Chris Matthews is referenced by Stewie when he suggests Brian is getting a big head, with the guest, United States Senator Harry Reid, then appearing on Matthews' forehead, suggesting Matthews is self-centered. After Reid continues to interrupt him, however, Matthews cuts to actor Kurtwood Smith, in which Matthews appears on Smith's forehead instead. Once Consuela is hired as the family maid, she first begins to annoy Peter by listening to stereotypical Latin music played loudly on a portable radio, in which the singer repeats the Spanish phrase \"\u00a1Muchos horn-os!\" which literally translates to \"many ovens\" but within the context of the show is actually meant to be Spanglish for \"many horns.\" In Consuela's final appearance in the episode, she is seen watching a commercial, which parodies local commercials urging viewers to hire a lawyer if they are in a car accident. In an attempt to try to prove that an animal has the same rights as humans, Brian starts an advocacy group, and is suggested by Lois to join PETA, but she is unable to enunciate the word differently from how she pronounces \"Peter,\" leading her husband to become confused. The end of the gag has Chris stating his belief that Betty White is a member of the organization, with his wording prompting Peter to yell, \"That doesn't even make sense!\"  Brian goes on to create a public service announcement regarding animal rights, one of which involves a dog being \"tortured\" by having to listen to the radio show All Things Considered on National Public Radio, which the dog's owner leaves on for him before leaving the house."

Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V.

It's got an equally good shot at making us care about these imperfect pretty girls.\" A writer on Terror Hook has stated that \" 'Pretty Little Liars' gets off to a very promising start. Great production all around, the writing keeps the viewer on their toes, and the acting just reinforces it. The overall mystery of the show in the end is dark and unpredictable, even stepping into the slasher film realm.\" The New York Post gave the show three out of five stars, stating, \"OK, so we've established that there is no socially redeeming value in this series and that your kids shouldn't watch it if they are too young and impressionable. But if you can distract them enough to miss the first 15 minutes, the show isn't half-bad. Actually, it is half-good, if that makes sense.\" The Los Angeles Times wrote that the series is \"one of those shows that manages to mildly, and perhaps unintentionally, spoof its genre while fully participating in it, and that's not a bad thing at all.\" Entertainment Weekly had a less favorable review, giving the show a letter grade of \"D\u2212\", saying, \"Imagine the pitch for Liars: It's I Know What You Did Last Summer meets Gossip Girl, but like not so subtle.\" It went on to say that the plot \"hits every racy teen entertainment mark so hard (everyone's hair is so full\u2014of secrets!) that it feels like the only thing missing is a visit from the ghosts of Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze, Jr.\" The Hollywood Reporter compared the show to those on The CW and noted, \"Sure, there's a lot here that sustains more eye-rolling than interested stares, but a little patience might be warranted.\""

To make things worse, Liz is summoned to jury duty and cannot avoid it despite claiming to be Princess Leia. When she leaves for jury duty, she does not leave anyone in charge and allows the staff to go without direction\u2014until later when she puts NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) in charge after learning that the staff have gotten out of hand. Liz is on a court case about a woman, named Rochelle Gaulke (Jackie Hoffman), whose work life and frustrations parallel her own; the two both have employees named Tracy and Jenna, both believe their employees waste their time, and make their lives difficult. Meanwhile, Jenna, worn out from working on TGS during the day and on her unlicensed Janis Joplin biopic at night, visits Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell) for help so she can work on both. He gives Jenna a military-grade experimental drug currently being tested on rats to stay awake. At the same time, Tracy believes that having enough money to pay FCC fines means that he can say anything on television, and he says to Liz, \"I can even say what Ernest Borgnine whispered to me.\" As a result, Tracy curses on The Martha Stewart Show, and after learning that the show's advertisers are pulling out, due to his actions, decides to sponsor the show. Meanwhile, Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for General Electric, Jack Donaghy, desperately tries to find a name for a pocket microwave oven that is not offensive in any language. With Liz gone, Jack assigns the TGS writing staff, Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), James \"Toofer\" Spurlock (Keith Powell), J. D. Lutz (John Lutz), Josh Girard (Lonny Ross), and Sue LaRoche-Van der Hout (Sue Galloway), to this task. After their unsuccessful attempts, Kenneth suggests \"The Funcooker\" which Jack decides is the perfect name. Back at the studios, the taping of TGS is interrupted by Dr. Spaceman who desperately forces Jenna to sleep because she might die like one of his test rats. Tracy creates a diversion by dropping his trousers and exposing his buttocks, which he refers to as the \"Funcooker\". Everyone realizes that this is where Kenneth heard the name. Fed up with the chaos, Liz sends the entire show's staff\u2014including Kenneth and Dr. Spaceman\u2014to her office. Liz ponders over a box of matches and thinks of the woman in court, in which she admitted to committing arson as a way of getting back at her out-of-control employees.

        "content": "The idea for 7 Khoon Maaf came when Ruskin Bond sent his book of Short Story collection to Vishal Bhardwaj. He was intrigued by a four-page story's title named \"Susanna's Seven Husbands\", and thought it had potential for a novel and a film. Bhardwaj said, \"I told myself why would a woman have seven husbands and then I came to know that she also kills them! I was immediately hooked to it. It reminded me of a very old film, Bluebeard's Seven Wives\". Bhardwaj suggested the story to a fellow director, who was looking for a good story. However, after reading the short story, the director dismissed it saying it has no film potential. After reading the story twice, he became even more confident about possibility of a film. Bhardwaj who had previously adapted Bond's novel The Blue Umbrella into a film, decided to adapt the short story for the screen. Bhardwaj later requested Bond to turn the story into a novella, noting that only Bond could flesh out the characters well, to which he agreed. Bond expanded the story into an 80-page novella, which later became a 200-page full-length Hindi script. Bhardwaj co-wrote the script with Matthew Robbins. Bhardwaj noted that he retained Bond's theme, but incorporated his own elements to make the film a dark comedy. He said, \"I had previously taken liberties with Shakespeare. Naturally, when you adapt a story, your vision also comes in it. But I have remained honest to its essence\". He included Keemat Lal (who plays a police officer in all Bond's stories), although the character is not in the original story. Bhardwaj decided to include him in the film as an homage to Bond, explaining that he took liberties with characters' names and traits. Bond also had to devise Indian methods of killing the husbands, which he found challenging: \"The challenge was devising seven ingenious ways in which she could kill her husbands without being suspected. And she does it successfully, until towards the end\"."

        "content": "Priyanka Chopra was Bhardwaj's original choice for the role of Susanna after he worked with the actress in Kaminey: He said that Chopra \"is the finest actor of her generation right now... As a director I had so much trust on her that I felt that no one else can essay this role as brilliantly as she would do\". Mohanlal was cast as one of Susanna's husbands in the film; however, he left the project to concentrate on Malayalam films. The actor was replaced by Annu Kapoor in the role of Inspector Keemat Lal. Other actors in the film were John Abraham, Naseeruddin Shah, Neil Nitin Mukesh and Vivaan Shah. Directors Karan Johar and Imtiaz Ali were approached to play two of the seven husbands, but they reportedly turned down the offer. Usha Uthup was cast as Susanna's maid in the film. Konkona Sen Sharma was confirmed for a cameo appearance. During production, the film underwent two name changes. The project was initially titled Seven, which became Ek Bataa Saat and finally 7 Khoon Maaf. In the film, Chopra's character ages from 20 to 45, and prosthetic makeup was used for her looks at different ages. Bhardwaj hired Hollywood special makeup effects artist Greg Cannom, who did the makeup for 2008's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, to create seven looks for the character. Chopra found the most challenging period was that of the 65-year-old woman. The actress said, \"prosthetics had to play a heavy part but I\u2019m happy that I pushed myself as the result is really fab. I had to be very careful of not doing things that would damage the make-up\". To make Chopra look authentic, the makeup team used Chopra's mother's and grandmother's photos to create her look. She had to gain five kg weight to fit her aging character."

The soundtrack received positive reviews from music critics. The Indo-Asian News Service gave the album 3.5 stars (out of 5): \"Bharadwaj has composed a wonderful album that is not a clone of his previous work. It exudes freshness and is worth listening. However, the songs would not have achieved zenith without Gulzar's lovely lyrics. The team has done it again\". Bollywood Hungama rated the album a 3 (out of 5): \"7 Khoon Maaf is a good album with a couple of definite hits, couple of skip worthy ones and the remaining have the potential to grow. Since 7 Khoon Maaf is not a routine Bollywood affair, it can't be expecting a quick pick at the stands from Day One\". The Hindustan Times noted that the soundtrack takes the listener through a variety of moods: \"Bhardwaj has certainly succeeded in adding new sounds to his catalogue. He continues to evade Bollywood monotony with this soundtrack [...] an innovative effort.\""

Following the preview-trailer launches, Chopra promoted the film by appearing with seven men (dressed as bridegrooms) at the Radio Mirchi FM studio. The succession of marriages and funerals was illustrated at a promotional event for the film, where Chopra appeared as a Catholic bride in a wedding gown holding a bouquet. A short time later she reappeared as a widow in mourning, for her husbands' funerals. Emphasizing the film's theme, Chopra introduced a \"seven ways to lose your Valentine\" press kit for reporters at a Valentines Day promotion. The kit contained a rope, a syringe, a knife, a bottle of poison, a sachet of potassium cyanide, an ice pick and a blister pack of Viagra, which was based on Susanna's way to kill her husbands in the film.

The film was screened at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival as part of its world premiere in the festival's Panorama section. At the Friedrichstadt Palace (a Berlin theatre) an audience of some 2,500 people watched the film on the festival's final evening, giving the director and the nine cast and crew members present a standing ovation when they appeared onstage. 7 Khoon Maaf was originally scheduled for release on 21 January 2011, but was postponed a month to avoid conflicting with Dhobi Ghat.

        "content": "The film opens in Araromire in 1908: There is an old folktale about a goddess Araromire who asked a priest to invoke her spirit into a figurine carved out of the bark of a cursed tree. When villagers of Araromire touched the figurine, Araromire would grant them wealth and prosperity in all their endeavours. This good fortune however unfortunately lasted for just seven years, after which everything deteriorated and became worse than it was seven years ago. The climax of the disaster was when the priest who invoked her spirit was found dead at the river. The villagers become infuriated and invaded the Araromire shrine; the shrine is burned down and that ended the evil of Araromire. Lagos, 2001: Femi (Ramsey Nouah) is about to go for his NYSC; He has been posted to Araromire \u2013 at this time, his father (David J. Oserwe) has been very ill (it is later revealed in the movie that he was dying of cancer). Sola (Kunle Afolayan) attends a job interview and apparently, he has no NYSC, He has also graduated with a third class. He is told he can't be employed without an NYSC certificate, so Sola visits the Dean of his faculty to get his clearance for NYSC. The Dean recognizes him as an irresponsible student who rarely attended his lectures. He further tells him that he used to date Mona who is on the contrary: a brilliant girl. The Dean asks him where he has been posted to; \"Araromire\", he replied. The Dean picks interest and brings out a book. He starts to narrate the folk story about the village and the goddess it was named after. However, Sola fails to listen to rest of the tale (the disaster which follows the seven years) as he politely leaves the dean's office with disinterest. Femi and Mona (Omoni Oboli) meet at the car park - She has been posted to Araromire as well; it is revealed here that they were once close friends. They both board a bus headed for Araromire. While in the bus, Mona is asleep and Femi brings out a ring; he stares at the ring and cuddles it while he stares at sleeping Mona. He is also seen cuddling the ring later at the camp. Sola finally arrives at the NYSC orientation camp when the camp is almost over. While at the camp, out on an endurance trek, Femi becomes drained and he stops in the woods to use his inhaler as he is an asthmatic patient. Sola also waits behind to help him out. While in the jungle, they begin to hear a strange sound which always comes up during camo parade. They both start to trace the sound and later discover a strange object on top of a tree that is emitting the sound. Rain starts to fall and they both find shelter in a mud house. Sola uses his lighter and starts to explore the place. The rain has stopped and Femi moves out of the building to get fresh air. Sola finds a figurine enclosed in a dusty wooden cradle. On the last day of Parade, Mona informs Femi that Sola proposed to her and she accepted. She also stated that she's carrying his baby. Femi seems jealous and tries to discourage Sola from getting married, but Sola declines. Sola brings out the figurine he found in the mud house and drops it on Femi's lap. Femi gets back from the NYSC only to see his father hale and hearty. He is also selected to go for a special training at his work place within just six months of his appointment. Sola gets a job as well and marries Mona. Seven years later, Femi arrives from abroad and attends Sola's 'get-together'. Mona (who is pregnant again) introduces Femi to Linda (Funlola Aofiyebi), a fashion designer. Throughout the party, Femi pays no attention to her and keeps staring at Mona whom he is apparently still in love with. Lara (Tosin Sido), Femi's younger sister, now lives with Sola's family as Mona is helping her with her thesis. However, The Araromire figurine is still kept at Sola's. Femi's asthma has been cured miraculously as he smoked at the party. Mona gets to know about the Araromire legend and she is worried; she begins to make conclusions and starts doubting the real source of the sudden wealth of the family. She also deduces that it may be the reason why her marriage with Sola has been so flawless, despite Sola having been a rascal and a Casanova back in school. She asks Lara to throw the figurine away but it returns into the house mysteriously. She then decides to throw it into the lagoon herself, she loses her pregnancy on her way to the lagoon. While dancing at the club with Linda, Femi gets an asthma attack again after so many years. Sola also starts having an affair with Ngozi again after so many years of being faithful to Mona, it is later discovered that he is having an affair with Lara as well and he also had an affair with Linda. Femi arrives at his apartment one day and sees his father dead in his crafts workshop. Both Femi and Sola eventually lose their jobs. Femi raises the topic of the figurine and suggests that they return it to the shrine; though Sola still doesn't believe the figurine is responsible for all the misfortune, he agrees. Junior (Tobe Oboli), Sola's first son, also dies by falling off from the building while trying to reach out to his mother \u2014 his father was having a big argument with his mum and the figurine was burnt. However, the figurine returns again. Then, Sola and Femi set out to return the figurine. Mona, now in depression, sends Lara out of her house believing she let her son die (she was supposed to be with him at the time Junior had the accident). Lara's box opens up while she's struggling with Linda who is throwing her things out and also pushing her out of the compound. Many Figurines; similar to the one in Sola's study start to fall out of Lara's box. Apparently, she has been responsible for 'the return of the figurine' each time it was thrown out! She's called in and she starts to make confessions revealing that She is being controlled by her brother, Femi. Femi and Sola arrive at the Araromire Shrine to return the figurine; rain starts to fall and Femi is nowhere to be found. While Sola is busy looking for Femi, Femi kills him by hitting him with a log of wood. Femi returns to Lagos and he is confronted by Linda, whom Lara has already confessed to. Femi confirms the truth by revealing many things which proves that the whole Araromire good luck and bad luck was all a charade orchestrated by him in order to kill Sola and get Mona all to himself. He terms the losing of their jobs, his father's death and his asthma 'coincidence'. He kills Linda afterwards and dumps her body in the lagoon. On his way back, he has his asthma attack and commands Lara to bring him his inhaler, but she refuses; instead, she calls the 'Rapid Response Squad' to report her brother's killings. Femi struggles to get upstairs. He reaches out to the body of Mona, he removes Sola's ring from her finger and replaces it with his ring (which he was always staring at earlier). The Rapid Response Squad arrives and declares Femi dead. Linda, Femi and Mona are later seen alive and the movie ends with the caption 'What do you believe'?"

Kunle Afolayan threw up a challenge to do something different which would be acceptable globally. The original idea for a thriller movie came long ago from Kunle Afolayan himself and Jovi Babs and it was to be titled Shrine. In 2006, Kunle Afolayan met a scriptwriter, Kemi Adesoye, and she was signed to write the script for the movie. A first draft script written by Kunle Afolayan was given to her. After going through the script, she said to the director \"It's funny, not a thriller\". The script had to be scrapped and another four different versions of a thriller movie were later written with the title Shrine. Care had to be taken when writing the script so as not insult people's beliefs; according to the Art Director, Pat Nebo, \"living in Nigeria is a war between our culture and our love for independence in different ways\". The script for the movie took nine months to be finalized and the development stage took five years. Within these periods, Kunle Afolayan shot a movie titled 'Irapada'; another spiritual-themed thriller which he said was just an \"experiment\". When he saw the success of Irapada, he then revisited The Figurine. According to Kunle, all his life savings were put into the movie. Meanwhile, the movie got sponsorship from a number of brands and corporate organizations which include MicCom Golf Resort, GSK, Omatek Computers and so on. After completion of the film however, other companies came on board like MTN, IRS Airlines, Cinekraft and Media partners like HiTV and many others."

MicCom Golf and Hotel Resort provided free accommodation for the cast and crew while they shot in Osun State, some scenes in the film were shot at the resort as well. The equipment used for the movie was gotten from Jungle Film Works; the only place in Nigeria at the time to get all the equipment needed for big budget movies. Jungle film Works eventually came on board as associate producers for the film. There were no professional stunts on ground, so most of the stunts were performed by Kunle Afolayan including a scene where the Priest was floating on the surface of the River; Kunle Afolayan was under the water lifting Ombo up. Other stunts were also performed by Mayowa Adebayo. For the two Shrine scenes where Rain was needed, the crew were in a Village in Osun state so they had to contact the fire fighters from the city to help out. On the first day of shooting, there was not enough pressure for the water to create the needed effect; the water eventually got finished and the shoot was cancelled for that day and was shot all over again the next day. There was a lot of makeup and special effects used on Ombo (the Priest); He is not very old, so apart from body paintings, skin bags had to be applied on his face, long grey hairs had to be attached to his eyebrows to make him look weird and fake contacts were added to his eyes as well. According to the script, the house Sola and Mona live is supposed to be a Lagoon House. It took three weeks; Kunle and the Location Manager, Biodun Apantaku visited all Houses in Lagos Island, but no one would release his house for a film shoot. The set later had to be created: the Set Designer had to erect a structure and create the necessary parts of the house (Sitting room, Kitchen and bedroom). However, sets for a couple of scenes were also created; for example, the mud house where the figurine was found was also erected. On a day of shooting, the crew were trying to move all the equipment to the Island by boat, including the generator: The boat capsized and shooting was shut down for over a week. When they resumed, smaller generators were gotten. As a result of the heavy lights they were using; One of the generators developed faults and everything that was brought blew up: the battery, the charger got burnt and the Shoot had to be cancelled for days again."

        "content": "Critical receptionThe Figurine was critically acclaimed. It was praised for its top-notch cinematography, props, and for being the movie to finally break the jinx of mediocrity in Nollywood and for leading the revolutionary birth of what has been termed New-Nollywood. Nollywood Reinvented praised the movie for its brilliant cinematography, memorable soundtrack, accurate set designing, 'the figurine Sculpture' and how the extras were used so as not to ruin the movie. It rated the film 74% and wrote \"Cinema is an art. Kunle Afolayan knows Cinema, therefore following the simple rules of logic, Kunle Afolayan is an artist\". Tosin Johnson wrote: \"A purely African Story, The Figurine Opens us into a relatively new genre in African story telling \u2013 A Psychological thriller. This was delivered with very impressive emotional acting and a colorful array of costumes\". Itua Ewoigbokhan of DStv praised Afolayan's story telling power and stated: \"Kunle Afolayan\u2019s The Figurine makes a strong point of seeking to change cinema culture in Nigeria and through this movie he wants viewers to think about the film - not just see it. Viewers of The Figurine: Araromire will leave the cinema neither happy nor sad. They will leave filled with questions, thus fulfilling what Afolayan set out to do: make us think\". Sakari Maatta of Elitisti, a Finnish movie online magazine gave a rating of 2.5 out of 5 stars  and concluded: \"The Figurine reflects the number of everyday topics such as friendship, love and loyalty, role of the family and, ultimately; betrayal and death. Kemi Adesoye the scriptwriter manages to offer in the last minutes, the best possible to pull off a surprise turn of events, which evokes thoughts\". tvNolly Commented \"Afolayan deserves credit for a superb and almost flawless production. The musical score is well produced, the lighting does justice to many of Lola Maja-Okojevoh\u2019s artistic creations, the special effects add to the magical feel and all in all, it is a great achievement not just for Nollywood but for the African cinematic industry as a whole. For raising the cinematographic bar to record heights and putting our culture in the limelight, The Figurine is one \u2018reference\u2019 movie that will be spoken about years to come\". Femi Owolabi gave it 3 out of 4 stars and states: \"The film\u2019s cultural relevance is so profound and its status in the social sphere is remarkable. The historical essence is highly applaudable too\" \"your eyes may never forgive you if you don\u2019t get to see this exceptionally brilliant movie\". Ayo Stephens commented that \"the major themes of fate and faith touched in this movie are very weighty ones and the writer does a very good job in leaving the audience to choose their sides. The Figurine is a must see, it would start up a discussion in you before you join the one going on around you\". Nollywood Reinvented commended Kunle Afolayan's show of ingenuity by producing, directing and starring in a single film, and the film still ends up turning out good: \"Being able to direct, produce and then come and act was something I previously regarded as impossible for any movie but hey! Kunle just defies all laws of nature it seems.\" She also commended Funlola Aofiyebi's acting in the film stating: \"Funlola as the comic relief; Amazing acting! It was never at one point over acting or underacting is what I loved the most about her performance.\" Itua Ewoigbokhan commended the use of Yoruba and English languages interchangeably to give realistic feel to the film: \"The Yoruba language spoken sometimes in the movie helped create a certain level of realism. The characters spoke Yoruba to themselves in private and reverted to the English language for more formal conversations as regular people would in real life. This level of detail would ensure a wider audience watches The Figurine\". Box officeThe Figurine was a success at the Nigerian box office. Due to the presence of few cinemas in the country as of 2009, the film's total gross was approximated at around 30 million Naira, after eight weeks of theatrical run. However, the movie was able to recoup its investment through international screenings. The movie was also screened in rented halls in Nigerian cities and schools. AwardsThe Figurine received ten nominations at the 6th Africa Movie Academy Awards and won five awards including the award for The Best Picture. It was the film with most wins at the ceremony. In October 2014, The Figurine topped Nolly Silver Screen Magazine's list of \"The 10 Best Nollywood Films Ever Made."

        "title": "The Figurine_Film analysis and themes",
        "content": "The story in The Figurine though seemed like a typical African tale, is in fact entirely fiction. The Village depicted, Araromire doesn't really exist (in tale, and in real life) and there is no goddess called \"Araromire\" in Nigeria. The theme music; though most believe is in Yoruba language, it isn't, and the chant is totally meaningless. The film has been described to be \"characterized by a strong spiritual theme spiced with a bit of romance\". Sakari Maatta comments that the film reflects the number of everyday topics such as friendship, love and loyalty, role of the family and, ultimately, betrayal and death. The lingering rhetoric question on the conclusion of the film remains: \"is The Figurine a story of a love triangle, friendship, loyalty, betrayal? Or is it about the lingering power of curses, whether or not we believe in fate?\" The goddess, Araromire has often been described as \"neither good nor evil\", since anyone who comes in contact with her will succeed for seven years then suffer for another seven years that follows it. As it is seen at the beginning of the film, the priest who invoked the spirit of Araromire drowns in the river after seven years of coming in contact with her: \"Araromire becomes wrathful, unleashing terror and destruction on whoever has her in custody. It is unfortunate that even the priest couldn't escape the adverse side of the deity\", Femi Owolabi comments. Itua Otaigbe Ewoigbokhan of Africa Magic describes the tale of Araromire as a modified version of Joseph's interpretation of Pharaoh's dream about Egypt from the Bible. In the present day of The Figurine world, Mona is still disturbed after getting to know about the folktale of the statue her husband has placed in their home; Sakari Maatta interprets this to mean that even though such old myths and beliefs have not been given too much weight in the film's society, they still live in the subconscious of the people. Ayo Stephens cited that Nigerian culture is sold to the audience throughout the film, giving an example of the scene where Junior (Tobe Oboli) (aged 7) is instructed by her mother, Mona to prostrate and greet his father both in Yoruba and Urhobo, which are respectively his father's and mother's dialects. The conclusion of the film which is left undecided has been subject to different interpretations. Most two popular interpretations are: a first possible scenario which explains that maybe the Araromire is really a powerful and real goddess. Using the phrase \"who the gods want to destroy they first make mad\", Itua Otaigbe Ewoigbokhan explained that Femi may have been possessed by the goddess to get so irrationally in love with Mona, leading to rage which results in the doom of him and the other parties. This means Araromire uses Femi's love as a tool to accomplish its mission. A second possible scenario explains that Araromire might really be a myth. Judging that Femi bribes officials to be posted to Araromire in order to be with Sola and Mona, it's also possible he has placed the Araromire in the Shrine and cunningly leads Sola to the place during trek. This is a very possible scenario, since the folktale in fact says that the Araromire has been \"destroyed\" by the Villagers. A resolution to this scenario will render the loss of jobs, Sola's kids accident as coincidence. And that Femi's Asthma and eyesight mystery, and his father's cancer mystery can be somehow explained scientifically. However, many analysts hold the conclusion that Araromire is responsible for the occurrences in the film. It has been derived that even though Femi is the orchestrator of the events, there's a glaring dominance of the goddess\u2019 powers. Anuli Agina of Pan-African University in his analysis of the film strongly believes that the film itself drives the viewers to believe in Araromire's powers. He cited instances such as; the fear evoked by Femi's father when Femi mentioned its name, the lecturer's curiosity. It affirms that there are several strands in the storytelling that points to the presence of the goddess in the lives of the three friends. He mentioned instances such; sounds heard on the parade ground, which mysteriously led Sola and Femi closer to the Sculpture; the heavy rain when: the Villagers burnt Araromire's shrine, the sculpture was discovered by the two friends and when both friends to returned it; the cure of Femi's health problems and his father's; the quick rise to success of Sola, without a change of his reckless attitude; the loss of Sola's son, Mona's miscarriage and so on. He concludes his analysis by stating: \"With deliberate or inadvertent camera movements, the film compels the belief that Araromire the goddess is not only powerful, but also present in the lives of those who touch her. There is a conflict of opposing forces, but clearly, one is the more powerful or the film director chose to make it so. The only incident that discredits Araromire\u2019s powers is that Femi does not have the woman of his dreams\". He says even though Afolayan skillfully presents two options, he has made one very less plausible."

Originally Lean considered making the lead character a Canadian and offered the part to Glenn Ford. Lean also offered the role to Kenneth More, who was unsure about whether the public would accept him in the part and turned it down. It was a decision More later regarded as \"the greatest mistake I ever made professionally\". Lean had completed a script in collaboration with Mason and cast Keiko Kishi as the girl, but disagreed with Alexander Korda, who was to have produced the film and the project fell through. Lean had already entered into discussions with Sam Spiegel, regarding a film version of Pierre Boulle's novel The Bridge on the River Kwai. After Korda's death in 1956, the rights to Mason's novel were sold to Rank Film Productions, who assigned the project to the team of Betty Box and Ralph Thomas. Filming took place on location in India in early 1958, with Dirk Bogarde in the main role. Ralph Thomas later said he thought Sir John Davis of Rank \"very bravely\" authorised location-filming in India \"because he trusted David Lean's judgement that it was a splendid book. It was a real three-handkerchief picture, which I thoroughly enjoyed making, and Dirk was very good in it.\""

The answers to the outstanding questions in these stories are all hidden in the secrets from a generation ago at the now abandoned Catholic boarding school on the reservation. In Story One, Ojibwe Native Americans Rain Many Lightnings O'Rourke (Georgina Lightning) and Johnny Goodfeather (Adam Beach), a teacher and a police officer have been living together for ten years, off the reservation despite Johnny's job solely out of circumstance. They have not felt ready to get married until now, Johnny asking her which coincides with his announcement that he has been accepted into the FBI training program in Washington, DC. Rain isn't sure if she is prepared to move, since her mother, Irene, has long been institutionalized in a local psychiatric institution diagnosed as schizophrenic, she inching closer to being in a vegetative state. Under this circumstance, Rain was raised by her Aunt Barbara (\"Auntie Apple\"), a devout Catholic who has long assimilated into western society and who turns to local priest Father Bartoli for any guidance. One day, after Rain swerves to avoid some children in the road and winds up in a car accident, Johnny swears there were none. What Rain eventually confides to Johnny is that she of late has been seeing visions of things she doesn't understand, she fearing that she may be going the way of her mother. She is later transferred to a psychiatric institution; when Johnny challenges Auntie Apple and tries to force his way to her, his hotheadedness gets him arrested. Rain eventually finds out the children she's been seeing running around the community are not living children, but the spirits of dead children. Through visions and investigations she discovers these unquiet dead are the little girls and boys who were murdered at the Indian boarding school that used to kidnap, institutionalize, and abuse children in the community. She realizes that the spirits of the children are speaking to her so the truth can come to light and that, maybe, the community can finally find healing. In Story Two, Luke Patterson (Bradley Cooper), a government geologist, has come to the area to investigate a reported earthquake - if it be the case, a rare earthquake - on the reservation. Beyond Johnny helping him get a city hall permit to investigate on the reservation, Luke befriends Johnny and his family during his extended stay in the area and begins to learn more about the history behind the reservation and the local boarding school from Johnny's father Pete. In Story Three, Steve Klamath is running for mayor against the long time incumbent, Paul Gunderson, who has always been pro-development on the reservation. As the campaign progresses, Steve, who wants to fight for indigenous rights from the inside of the establishment, seems to be waging a losing battle both within the Native population as they historically stay home on voting day, and with the non-Native population who largely viewing him with contempt for his policies. Local radio talk show host Richard Two Rivers (Wes Studi), who is seen as the voice of the reservation, outwardly gives Steve's campaign airtime if only because it is Steve's side who contacts the radio station about the campaign, although his background shows Richard may not be who he is as perceived by the public."

Her father, who occasionally had violent outbursts, had been silent about his childhood. When Lightning was 18, her father committed suicide. This shocking event launched her on a quest, as she attempted to find out about her father's mysterious childhood. In the course of her research, she found herself visiting the Indian boarding school where her father, along with many First Nations children, had been institutionalized as a boy. She saw the large cemetery behind the school, with the names of so many young students on the headstones. From this disturbing experience, the concept for the film emerged. While the filmmaker is from Canada, the film is set in America, and was shot primarily at the Fond du Lac Indian Reservation in Minnesota. Filming took place in late 2006 on or around the Fond du Lac Reservation and Cloquet, Minnesota."

He steals the uniform, impersonating a soldier in the town to find the nun he encountered earlier during the assault. He embraces her but she runs away. After seeing some captured rebels being marched off, he finds a room full of officers and lobs a grenade inside. Gabriel goes to rejoin the rebels, only to find them being routed by the much-larger German army. In the course of running from some soldiers, Gabriel finds the nurse again and this time she accepts. Gabriel finally rejoins the rebels, and discovers another brother, Alojz, has been killed. The fighting continues and Gabriel goes off again, taking out a sniper in a telescope tower. He, along with the audience, view Polish troops raising the Polish flag, as well as the sight of the landscape in all directions. The rebels begin constructing a barricade, when they are delivered a few cases of dynamite. Gabriel returns home to see his father and hide the dynamite. Several Polish soldiers have stolen a cannon and brought it to the barricade, helping the insurgents win the battle. In the next major battle, barrel bombs and an ambush help them to repel a German attack. However, a counterattack results in close quarters combat. The rebels fight off the attack, but are greatly wearied at this point. The Basista home, which was right behind the partisan\u2019s trench, has been all but obliterated in the attack. During the next assault, the Basista house is destroyed, their father killed by cannon fire. The fighting becomes increasingly brutal, with many hand-to-hand fights between men. The rebels, in a last ditch effort, blow up what remains of the Basista home as a diversion to allow them to escape across the river. Having regrouped in a warehouse in town, the German army has surrounded their position and they realize they have failed. Their leader Erwin informs them of this fact and tells them to write their wills. Gabriel asks Erwin why Poland has not helped them, and he does not know how to answer him. The rebels make a run for it through the town, but many of them are cut down, and the others  captured. The remaining rebels are executed, The film ends with four women bringing a dying Gabriel across to Poland, where he is reunited with Erwin and his remaining brothers. His fate is uncertain."

        "content": "In Atlanta, Dave Lockwood is married with three children, while his best friend Mitch Planko is single and at his sexual prime. After getting drunk at a bar, Mitch and Dave urinate into a fountain, simultaneously wishing they had each other's lives. The next morning, Mitch and Dave realize they have switched bodies. They return to the park to wish for their lives back, but the fountain has been removed for restoration. Forced to wait until the parks department locates the fountain, Mitch and Dave agree to pose as each other. At Dave's law office, Mitch befriends Dave's assistant Sabrina, but his lack of professionalism and legal knowledge sabotage an important merger with a Japanese firm. Dave arrives at Mitch's film shoot, discovering it is a \"lorno\" \u2013 \"light\" pornography. Dave takes Mitch to tell his wife Jamie the truth, but Jamie does not believe him. Dave advises Mitch on how to behave professionally, and Mitch sets up Dave on a date with Sabrina, on whom Mitch has a crush. After speaking with his father, Mitch rededicates himself to Dave's life. At her ballet recital, Dave's eldest child Cara takes Mitch's advice and throws her bully to the floor, to which Mitch foul-mouthedly cheers. Cara tells Mitch that she loves him and Mitch says the same, but feels guilty. Dave takes the day off to take full advantage of being Mitch, who coaches him how to act like Mitch on the date, and shaves off Dave's pubic hair. Sabrina meets Dave at a classy restaurant and, despite only going because Mitch told her to, genuinely likes him, and they get tattoos. Dave walks Sabrina home, and she tells him to call her. Mitch learns Dave previously told Jamie not to invite Mitch to their anniversary party, afraid he would ruin it with his usual antics. Dave informs Mitch the fountain has been found, but they both imply they want to stay as each other. Mitch, forgetting about the \"Dialogue Night\" he planned with Jamie, accidentally stands her up. At the new merger meeting, the Japanese representatives offer only $625 million, $75 million short. As Dave's firm is about to agree, Mitch observes that the other representatives have not yet left, and compares the negotiations to sex and porn. He demands $725 million and has the representatives of Dave's firm begin to leave, scaring the other firm into agreement. Mitch and Dave's family go to a gala held by Dave's firm in honor of Dave being made partner, but Jamie is upset, knowing Dave will never truly be happy. Dave and Sabrina are at a baseball game when a thunderstorm hits, and wait it out at Mitch's house. Sabrina tells Dave she is going to have sex with him, but he notices her tattoo of a many-spotted skipperling \u2013 his daughter's favorite butterfly \u2013 and regretfully leaves. At the gala, Dave's boss delivers a speech about Dave's accomplishments and his love for his family, filling Mitch with guilt. Dave rushes in and kisses Jamie, finally convincing her that he is her husband. He and Mitch find the fountain in the center of the Peachtree Galleria, surrounded by people. Proceeding with their plan to urinate in the fountain, Mitch is too embarrassed, especially after the crowd notices Dave doing so. Mitch asks why Dave did not invite him to his anniversary party, and Dave admits he was embarrassed by Mitch, but has grown to respect him while in his body. This relaxes Mitch enough to urinate, but their wish does not work. Security approaches, but on Mitch and Dave's third try the Galleria's lights go out, and they run away. In an epilogue, Dave and Mitch are thrilled to have returned to their original bodies. Mitch gets breakfast with Sabrina, not realizing the tattoo Dave got is of his face on Mitch's back, captioned \"I \u2665 Dave\". Mitch speaks at his father's wedding, and attends Dave's anniversary party. In a post-credits scene, Dave and Jamie get high and visit the aquarium, while Mitch and Sabrina have sex for the first time, and Mitch sends Dave the porno he starred in."

Several of the bar scenes were shot on location at a bar called Joe's on Juniper, in midtown Atlanta. The exterior and interior scenes of the Lockwood home were shot on location at a Buckhead residence designed by Atlanta residential designer Steve McClanahan. The movie was also shot in Los Angeles. The house used for the Lockwood home is on the 2400 block of Gramercy Park in historic West Adams. Despite being set in the summertime, production continued during a major winter storm that briefly crippled the city in January, leaving Peachtree and other streets covered in snow and ice and nearly preventing the governor's inauguration. Reynolds complimented the city in his interview on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, but joked that he thought the city \"was trying to kill\" him because of several unrelated incidents on the set and in his personal life that happened to occur during production. During her interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Olivia Wilde stated that she refused to appear naked or take most of her clothes off and used a body double for some shots and wore pasties for close-up and upper shots. Leslie Mann has also followed this technique while other actresses used prosthetics."

        "content": "A group of students from Volda University College, Thomas (Glenn Erland Tosterud), Johanna (Johanna M\u00f8rck) and their cameraman Kalle (Tomas Alf Larsen), set out to make a documentary about a suspected bear poacher, Hans (Otto Jespersen). At the site of an illegally slain bear they interview local hunters, who comment that the bear tracks look odd, as well as Finn Haugen (Hans Morten Hansen), head of the Norwegian Wildlife Board. Finn dismisses the idea that the bear tracks could have been faked. The students follow Hans in an attempt to secure an interview but he continually rebuffs them. After following him into a forest at night time, they see mysterious flashing lights and hear roars. Hans comes running back, screaming \"Troll!\" Thomas is attacked and reveals that he was bitten by something. They escape in Hans's Land Rover and discover their own vehicle turned over with the tyres ripped off. Hans admits that it is not bears he is hunting, but trolls. Though sceptical, the students ask if they can join Hans and film his hunt, to which he consents on the condition that they do exactly as he instructs. The next day Hans makes them disguise themselves with \"troll stench\" (a slimy concentrate made from \"everything you can squeeze out of a troll\") and asks if any of them believe in God or Jesus, because a troll can smell a Christian man's blood. Hans wields a \"flash gun\", a weapon that emits powerful UV-rays to simulate sunlight and turn trolls to stone, though he comments that sometimes the trolls \"just explode\" depending on how old they are. The students are stunned when Hans flushes out a giant three-headed troll (called a Tusseladd). Hans manages to turn the troll to stone and explains to the students that he only allowed them to come along because he's tired of working for little compensation and wants them to divulge the truth. Finn, who actually works for the Troll Security Service (TSS), arrives with a team to deposit a bear carcass and plant fake tracks, and tells the students that they will not be allowed to keep their tapes. In a series of interviews, Hans reveals that Finn's work is to keep trolls a secret, while his is to kill any that come near populated areas. He also explains that the trolls have been acting aggressively lately and have begun to leave their territories more often than usual, and that he must get a troll blood sample to determine why. The students accompany Hans on another hunt using live goats on a bridge as bait. Hans successfully obtains a blood sample from a bridge troll (Raglefant) and takes it to a veterinarian who works for the TSS, but finds that it will take several days before any results can be found. Investigating a farm where a number of trees have been uprooted, Hans and the film crew find troll tracks leading into an abandoned mine, the lair of a pack of cave trolls (Dovregubbens). The trolls return unexpectedly and the group is trapped inside. The situation becomes more tense when Kalle confesses that he is, in fact, a Christian. The trolls pick up Kalle's scent and discover the group. In a panic, the group runs for the safety of daylight at the cave entrance, but Kalle is caught and killed before he can escape. The replacement camerawoman is Malica, a Muslim; Hans is uncertain about how trolls will react to that. Finn demands that Hans head north to troll territory to get the problem under control. The group finds signs of a Jotnar, a giant mountain troll 50\u2013100 metres tall. Thomas falls ill, and they learn that the troll blood sample came back positive for rabies, meaning Thomas has been infected by the bite he received several days earlier. After several attempts, Hans manages to kill the Jotnar by launching a rocket-like projectile that transforms the troll into stone. Before doing so, he directs the others to find the highway. Finn and his TSS agents arrive to confiscate the students' tapes. Thomas flees with the camera and collapses at the side of a road when the tape cuts out. Just before the cut to black, a truck is seen coming down the road towards the camera. An epilogue tells the audience that none of the students were heard from again. The film ends with a news clip of the Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg appearing to admit to the existence of trolls, though the press fails to take notice."

The film received four points out of six in the newspapers Klassekampen and Verdens Gang as well. Verdens Gang critic Morten St\u00e5le Nilsen summed it up as \"Better than we feared.

        "title": "Trollhunter_Cultural references",
        "content": "Trollhunter contains many references to Norwegian culture and Norwegian folktales in particular. Among those are the belief that there are different species of trolls, such as the woodland and mountain trolls, which can be further categorised into subspecies as in the film. The most well-known is probably the Mountain King, which is mentioned in the play Peer Gynt and its music by Edvard Grieg. The Norwegian name for Mountain King, Dovregubbe, is a compound word whose first part is used in the name for the mountain range Dovrefjell where the characters meet the final troll. Other common troll descriptions from Norwegian folklore which are used in the film include trolls having a tail, multiple heads, the ability to smell a Christian's blood, eating rocks, but loving meat and sometimes being man-eaters. The trolls are also described as big, old, strong, but slow and dim-witted, turning to stone when exposed to sunlight. The latter is a point emphasised in the film, as Hans uses UV light to kill the trolls. However, he also states that not everything from the tales is true. The film also has several specific references to fairy tales. For example The Boy Who Had an Eating Match with a Troll when the camera man asks about an eating contest, and the Three Billy Goats Gruff when Hans attempts to lure a troll from under a bridge using three goats. The fairy tale Soria Moria Castle is one of the tales that tells about trolls being able to smell a Christian man's blood. A painting by Theodor Kittelsen based on the same fairy tale is also used as a backdrop on one of the trips they do in the film (Thomas stands in the same pose and asks his friends \"Do I look like that famous painting?\"). The look of the trolls in the film is also influenced by painters like Theodor Kittelsen and John Bauer. As reflected by how the students answer Hans, only a fraction of Norwegians consider themselves religious or visit the church regularly, even though the majority of Norwegians are members of the state church. The film also makes references to the often heated conflict between farmers and predators eating their livestock and the farmers' limited ability to react without breaking Norwegian wild life regulations. Similarly there are conflicts that arise when new power lines need to be passed through the landscape. With several of the cast being comedians that are fairly well-known to the Norwegian audience, including Otto Jespersen playing Hans, it also sets the tone of the film for many. Robert Stoltenberg playing the Polish bear hunter makes that scene less serious, and plays on xenophobic stereotypes that most Norwegian immigrants are from Poland, often speak mediocre Norwegian or English, do what they are told without asking questions and often do the work Norwegians won't do themselves."

        "content": "The film uses a nonlinear narrative, alternating between J. Edgar Hoover's role in establishing the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and his later years trying to safeguard it against perceived threats. As a frame story, the aging Hoover narrates the events of the Bureau's early years to a series of agents he has assigned to ghostwrite a book about it. In 1919, Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer survives an assassination attempt by anarchists and assigns Justice Department employee Hoover to a division dedicated to purging radicals. Helen Gandy rejects Hoover's awkward advances, but becomes his personal secretary and confidant. By arranging to make the anarchist Emma Goldman eligible for deportation, Hoover creates legal precedent to deport numerous other radicals. Following the Palmer Raids, Palmer loses his job and his successor, Harlan F. Stone, appoints Hoover as director of the department's Bureau of Investigation. Hoover has Gandy create a confidential file in which he collects incriminating information on people in power. With the First Red Scare over, Hoover focuses the Bureau on fighting gangsters. When the Lindbergh kidnapping captures national attention in 1932, he urges passage of the Federal Kidnapping Act, increasing the Bureau's power. He establishes the FBI Laboratory, applying forensic science techniques to the investigation, and has the registration numbers on the ransom bills monitored. Though Charles Lindbergh Jr. is found dead, these techniques lead to the arrest and conviction of Bruno Richard Hauptmann for the crime. Well into adulthood, Hoover continues to live with his mother, who is his moral guide. He hires Clyde Tolson to the Bureau in 1930; the two develop a close personal relationship, and Hoover promotes Tolson to Associate Director. When Hoover confesses to his mother that he is uncomfortable in romantic situations with women, she says she would rather he be dead than gay. When Tolson tells Hoover that he loves him, Hoover panics and claims that he wants to marry actress Dorothy Lamour. Tolson becomes infuriated and the two fight, culminating in Tolson kissing Hoover and threatening to end their association if Hoover ever talks about another woman again. Hoover's mother dies, and he is grief-stricken. Following an embarrassing line of questioning by Senate Appropriations Committee chair Kenneth McKellar in 1933, Hoover becomes increasingly vengeful against those who challenge his reputation and the Bureau's. He uses covert listening devices to collect compromising information which he uses to blackmail key political figures over the years, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, protecting his position and increasing the Bureau's power. He starts an illegal counterintelligence program to fight what he perceives as a new wave of radicals, culminating in his unsuccessful attempt to blackmail Martin Luther King Jr. into declining the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 via the FBI\u2013King suicide letter. Tolson suffers a stroke, and Hoover's strength declines with age. Fearing that President Richard Nixon will acquire his confidential files and use them to ruin the FBI's reputation, he asks Gandy to keep them out of Nixon's hands. Tolson urges Hoover to retire and accuses him of exaggerating his involvement with key events in the Bureau's history. Hoover admits his feelings for Tolson before dying at home. Gandy destroys Hoover's files before Nixon's men can seize them."

        "content": "Brian Grazer had been considering making a film about Hoover, and approached Dustin Lance Black to write the screenplay. Black began working on it in 2008, producing several drafts over a two year period. Warner Bros. Pictures wanted to keep the budget down, so producers Grazer and Robert Lorenz brought in Clint Eastwood, known for his efficient filmmaking, to direct and co-produce. Eastwood was able to shoot the film in 39 days and complete it under budget, for a total of $35 million. Unnamed sources cited by The Hollywood Reporter claimed that Leonardo DiCaprio dropped his usual fee from $20 million to $2 million to star in the film. For scenes in which he played the aged Hoover, DiCaprio had to spend up to six hours having makeup applied. Charlize Theron was originally slated to play Helen Gandy, but dropped out of the project to do Snow White and the Huntsman. Eastwood considered Amy Adams before finally selecting Naomi Watts for the role. Though much of the film is set in Washington, D.C., only a few scenes were shot there, including the interior of the Library of Congress and the view from the balcony of Hoover's former office. The exterior of the courthouse in Warrenton, Virginia was used to represent the Hunterdon County Courthouse in Flemington, New Jersey, where Richard Hauptmann's trial took place. Scenes set inside the courthouse were filmed at the Old Orange County Courthouse in Santa Ana, California. Scenes of the Lindbergh estate were shot in The Plains, Virginia, while Arlington County, Virginia was filmed for some historic neighborhoods. Most of the film was shot in and around Los Angeles. Sets representing the hallways of the United States Department of Justice and several offices were built on Stage 16 at the Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank. The Cicada Restaurant, near Pershing Square, stood in for New York's Stork Club, while the Park Plaza Hotel served as both the men's department of Garfinckel's department store and the United States Senate chamber. The Pico House represented a train station for a scene depicting the Kansas City massacre. Some interior restaurant scenes were filmed at the Smoke House Restaurant, across the street from the Warner Bros. Studios."

        "content": "On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 43% based on 243 reviews, with an average rating of 5.72/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Leonardo DiCaprio gives a predictably powerhouse performance, but J. Edgar stumbles in all other departments: cheesy makeup, poor lighting, confusing narrative, and humdrum storytelling.\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating to reviews, gives the film a normalized score of 59 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert awarded the film three-and-a-half stars (out of four) and wrote that the film is \"fascinating\" and \"masterful\". He praised DiCaprio's performance as a \"fully-realized, subtle and persuasive performance, hinting at more than Hoover ever revealed, perhaps even to himself\". Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, writing, \"This surprising collaboration between director Clint Eastwood and Milk screenwriter Dustin Lance Black tackles its trickiest challenges with plausibility and good sense, while serving up a simmeringly caustic view of its controversial subject's behavior, public and private.\"  David Denby in The New Yorker magazine also liked the film, calling it a \"nuanced account\" and calling \"Eastwood's touch light and sure, his judgment sound, the moments of pathos held just long enough.\" J. Hoberman of The Village Voice wrote: \"Although hardly flawless, Eastwood's biopic is his richest, most ambitious movie since Letters from Iwo Jima and Flags of Our Fathers.\" Peter Debruge of Variety gave the film a mixed review: \"Any movie in which the longtime FBI honcho features as the central character must supply some insight into what made him tick, or suffer from the reality that the Bureau's exploits were far more interesting than the bureaucrat who ran it \u2013 a dilemma J. Edgar never rises above.\" David Edelstein of New York Magazine reacted negatively to the film and said: \"It's too bad J. Edgar is so shapeless and turgid and ham-handed, so rich in bad lines and worse readings.\" He praised DiCaprio's performance: \"There's something appealingly straightforward about the way he physicalizes Hoover's inner struggle, the body always slightly out of sync with the mind that vigilantly monitors every move.\""

She praises DiCaprio for conveying the tempo of Hoover's speech. However, she notes that the film's central narrative device in which Hoover dictates his memoirs to FBI agents chosen as writers, is fictitious: \"He didn't ever have the sort of formal situation that you see in the movie where he was dictating a memoir to a series of young agents, and that that is the official record of the FBI.\" Historian Aaron J. Stockham of the Waterford School, whose dissertation was on the relationship of the FBI and the US Congress during the Hoover years, wrote on the History News Network of George Mason University, \"J. Edgar portrays Hoover as the man who successfully integrated scientific processes into law enforcement investigations.... There is no doubt, from the historical record, that Hoover was instrumental in creating the FBI's scientific reputation.\" Stockham notes that Hoover probably did not write the FBI\u2013King suicide letter to Martin Luther King, Jr., as the film portrays: \"While such a letter was written, Hoover almost certainly delegated it to others within the Bureau.\""

        "content": "The Man with the Iron Fists is a 2012 American martial arts film directed by Rza and written by RZA and Eli Roth. The film stars RZA, Russell Crowe, Cung Le, Lucy Liu, Byron Mann, Rick Yune, Dave Bautista, and Jamie Chung. Set in 19th century China, the story follows a series of lone warriors who are forced to unite to defeat a common foe and save their home of Jungle Village. Development began in 2005 when RZA shared his idea for the film with Roth. After nearly two years of development, Roth and RZA secured financial backing in May 2010. Filming began in December 2010 on a $15\u00a0million budget and concluded by March 2011. The film was shot in Shanghai and at other locations in China. RZA and Howard Drossin composed the film's musical score, and RZA produced its soundtrack, which featured several new songs by various artists. A series of concerts featuring music from the soundtrack were held to promote the film. The film was released in North America on November 2, 2012. Critics were divided over the film's homage to martial arts films, considering it well-choreographed and representative of the genre, but offering nothing original, and the direction was criticized for a lack of refinement. The performances of Crowe and Mann were well received. The film earned $20.5\u00a0million at the box office."

        "content": "In 19th-century China, Jungle Village is home to several warring clans. The village blacksmith creates deadly weapons for the clans, intending to use his payments to purchase the freedom of his lover Lady Silk, and leave the village. The region's governor tasks the Lion Clan's leader, Gold Lion, with protecting a large shipment of gold that must pass through the village. Gold is betrayed by his lieutenants Silver Lion and Bronze Lion, who plan to steal the gold. They use the chaos ensuing from a fight with the Hyena Clan to allow their co-conspirator Poison Dagger\u2014the governor's aide\u2014to assassinate Gold, after which Silver becomes the Lions' leader. Gold's son Zen-Yi learns of his father's murder and sets off to the village to seek revenge. The Qing Emperor's undercover emissary Jack Knife arrives in the village to monitor the gold and takes up residence in the Pink Blossom, a brothel run by Madam Blossom, Lady Silk's madame. Silver sends members of the Rodent clan to kill Zen-Yi before he can reach the village, but Zen-Yi kills them. The mercenary Brass Body arrives in the village and meets with Silver; he is sent to kill Zen-Yi. The blacksmith meets with Silk in the brothel and delivers the final payment needed to free her. After arriving in the village, Zen-Yi and his men are confronted by Brass and find that they cannot physically harm him because his skin turns to metal on impact. Brass beats Zen-Yi and destroys his blade-laden armor. Zen-Yi's last surviving man sacrifices himself to pull a canopy support beam loose, burying Brass under heavy stone. The blacksmith is watching the fight; he rescues Zen-Yi and helps him recover as penance for crafting the weapon that killed Zen-Yi's father. Meanwhile, the gold shipment arrives in the village, accompanied by two skilled warriors, the Geminis. The Lions soon confront the Geminis and their men, and in the ensuing fight, Poison Dagger assassinates the Geminis and the Lions capture the gold. Jack later arrives to investigate the incident and learns that the Geminis were poisoned with mercury-tipped weapons, leading him to the blacksmith. The Lions' theft prompts the governor to send his Jackal troops to recover the shipment or destroy the village. Zen-Yi asks the blacksmith to craft him a new suit of weaponized armor. The Lions suspect that the blacksmith is helping Zen-Yi and have him tortured for information. The blacksmith refuses to talk, and Brass cuts off his forearms. Jack, who had been following the blacksmith, saves him from bleeding to death. While the blacksmith recovers, he tells Jack of his past as an emancipated American slave who accidentally killed a white man who refused to let him go. He fled America by boat and went to China, where monks trained him to use his body's energy to perform superhuman feats. Jack with the aid of the blacksmith crafts his greatest weapon: a pair of iron forearms that he can animate using this energy. Zen-Yi recovers and joins Jack and the blacksmith. Meanwhile, Blossom offers to let Silver hide the gold in a secret tomb beneath the brothel in return for payment. The gold is stored in a coffin which is raised up to the rafters. That night, Blossom has her girls serve the Lions, and Silk serves Brass. At Blossom's signal, the girls use weapons hidden in their mouths to poison many of the Lions, and they join with Blossom as the Black Widows. When Silk tries to poison Brass, his skin protects him, and he beats and almost kills her. Zen-Yi, Jack, and the blacksmith arrive and join with the Black Widows to fight the remaining Lions while Blossom and Bronze fight and kill each other. While fighting Jack, Poison Dagger is crushed between large moving gears. Silver and Zen-Yi fight in the tomb; Zen-Yi cuts the coffin free, and it crushes Silver. The blacksmith finds Silk, who dies in his arms. He confronts Brass, and his iron fists prove capable of inflicting damage on Brass' seemingly invincible body. While Brass is in metal form, a powerful punch from the blacksmith shatters him to pieces. Jack runs outside in time to stop the soldiers from decimating the building with Gatling guns. Ultimately, Jack leaves the village to accompany the gold, and Zen-Yi tells the blacksmith that he has gained a brother. With the clans destroyed and the village safe, the blacksmith vows to keep it that way and destroys the sign pointing to his weapon shop. During the credits, Zen-Yi's pregnant fianc\u00e9e is kidnapped by a bird clan, prompting Zen-Yi to seek the blacksmith's aid."

        "title": "The Man with the Iron Fists_Development",
        "content": "Development of the film began in 2003 when RZA produced the soundtrack for Quentin Tarantinos film Kill Bill. RZA set himself a $50,000 budget and flew to the Kill Bill set in Beijing, where he spent approximately thirty days taking notes on the way Tarantino directed the film. In 2005, RZA met Eli Roth in Iceland, and they traveled together to LA. During the journey, RZA told Roth of his idea for a kung fu genre film, which attracted Roth's interest, but no further progress was made. RZA completed the story for the film, but Roth convinced him that he would need a completed screenplay for the project to gain any support. In 2007, after Roth's Hostel: Part II was released, Roth and RZA agreed to seriously pursue the project. The pair took the project to several studios and met with their preferred producer, Edward R. Pressman. One of the studios suggested setting the film in a post-apocalyptic situation, which RZA considered. They took the project to Strike Entertainment, which considered that it needed more development and assigned several writers to rewrite the script, which began to depart from RZA's initial idea. RZA continued to work with Strike Entertainment's writers, but Roth, who returned from filming Inglourious Basterds, was disappointed with the rewritten screenplay and he and RZA spent a year developing and finalizing it. In total, they spent between 18 months and 2 years developing the screenplay in between other projects, and turned RZA's 90-page story into a 130-page screenplay. Citing the specificity of the fictional universe in the Star Wars series, Roth said that the pair tried to fully define the aspects of The Man with the Iron Fists to make it interesting without fight scenes. Roth said that RZA had \"imagined every tribe, every fighting style, every costume\". The original script focused on several animal-themed clans fighting over territory, in particular Jungle Village, which acted as a center for shipments. As the script developed, several of the clans were removed, and the focus shifted to commerce and the transportation of government gold, which also introduced the government as a higher power over the clans. RZA and Roth approached fights in the script by introducing a new character, fighting style or weapon to avoid monotony; if a fight did not advance the story, they removed it. RZA then financed and directed a short martial arts film called Wu-Tang vs. the Golden Phoenix featuring Hong Kong-based, kung-fu-trained actors. When he and Roth pitched The Man with the Iron Fists to producers, RZA used the short film to prove that he could handle the martial arts action and be trusted to take on his first directing role. On May 7, 2010, Universal Pictures announced it had agreed to finance and distribute the film, which Roth and Strike Entertainment's Marc Abraham and Eric Newman would produce. The producers gave RZA a $20\u00a0million budget. During the development process, Tarantino agreed to lend his name to the film with a \"presented by\" credit. In October 2012, RZA said that he and Tarantino had intended to cross over The Man with the Iron Fists with Tarantino's 2012 Western Django Unchained. The crossover would have included a younger version of RZA's blacksmith character in a slave auction, but scheduling conflicts prevented RZA's participation. The Man with the Iron Fists spent 14 weeks in pre-production including four to six weeks on location scouting. RZA insisted that six weeks of pre-production would be sufficient, but Marc Abraham told him to take 14 weeks, for which RZA was later thankful after he reached week 13 and still needed more time. During filming, RZA and Roth discussed the potential for a sequel if the film was successful."

Filming began in China in December 2010 in locations including the city of Shanghai and Hengdian World Studios, and continued until March 2011. Corey Yuen was the film's action choreographer. To compensate for time lost to filming issues, some scenes were filmed in a single take. Approximately 6 weeks into filming, RZA began pushing the crew to work faster to remain on schedule. His assistant director eventually informed RZA that because of the push, some stunt workers were injured and being sent to hospital. After this, RZA abandoned some of his intended shots and replaced them with Computer Generated Images (CGI). Roth also directed some shots for RZA. Crowe and Le were originally scripted to fight each other, but because of Crowe's limited shooting schedule, he did not have the time to rehearse the fight, and instead Le was scripted to fight Liu. The first cut of the film was four hours long and RZA suggested splitting it into two films, but Roth disagreed. It was edited to 96 minutes to meet the studio's requirements and to excise graphic content that would cause it to receive a restrictive rating, limiting its audience. RZA abandoned the editing process for two weeks, feeling disgust at having to cut the film. In October 2012, he said that he intended to release a \"director's cut\" of the film for home viewing, and would reinsert at least 13 minutes of the cut footage. RZA described the film as an homage to the martial art films of the Hong Kong-based Shaw Brothers. The film used mostly practical special effects in preference to CGI. An effect in which Yune's character kills six opponents whose airborne blood spray spells out \"revenge\" in Chinese, was specifically written to use CGI. RZA declined to subtitle the message for English audiences. The action scenes resulted in several injuries, and Bautista suffered raw and bleeding arms from RZA's sandpaper-like prop iron fists during their fight scene."

CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was  \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale. Varietys Andrew Barker called the film endearing and engagingly enthusiastic, and said it is \"more fun than it ought to be\". Barker considered RZA's on-screen role to be too withdrawn to carry the central character role, but praised the supporting performances, especially those of Le's crime lord and Crowe, who Barker said \"smirkingly goes for broke to an extent that viewers haven't seen from him since, well ... ever.\" Barker also praised the film's score, but was critical of the script's uneven tone. The New York Timess Manohla Dargis called it an erratically enjoyable product of a deep cinephile passion for the martial arts genre. Dargis praised Crowe's performance and Byron Mann's \"gaudy baddie with heavy-metal hair and a psycho grin\", but considered RZA's central role a mistake, saying \"with his sleepy eyes and an affect so laid-back\u00a0...\u00a0[he] is too recessive a screen presence to make the character pop, much less hold your interest\". The A.V. Club's Nathan Rabin credited RZA's conceptualization of the \"rich, bloody, dense universe he created down to the most insignificant details\", and praised RZA's \"powerful inner calm\" and Crowe's \"defiantly theatrical turn\". The Los Angeles Times Betsy Sharkey called it a martial-arts spectacle that \"may just be one of the best bad movies ever.\" Sharkey said that some uneven performances and lack of refinement were the result of RZA's lack of directing experience, but appreciated the choreography of the \"extreme action\" and the film's visual aesthetic, which she described as \"a blend of French Baroque and ancient China\". Sharkey said that the plot \"goes seriously off-course\" when expanding on the Blacksmith's history. The Hollywood Reporters Todd McCarthy said that the film is \"sufficiently well done and amusing enough to satisfy the appetites of fans who mainline this sort of thing,\" but considered that in directly acting as an homage to the genre, it lacked any stylistic inspiration or imaginative flair to reinvent it. McCarthy however praised the imaginative weapon designs, and the performances of Lucy Liu and Crowe. The Village Voices Nick Pinkerton said \"the action scenes are often too cluttered for legibility, and, curious to say of a movie made by a musician, the film has broad swaths without tempo\", and added that it has a homemade charm that he found \"curiously touching\". USA Todays Scott Bowles was critical of the film, awarding it 1.5 stars out of 4. He said that the film is \"heavy on bloody kung fu action...and light on just about everything else\", that it \"doesn't have enough tension to be taken seriously, or enough laughs to be taken lightly\", and called it \"slick and hip\". Bowles wrote that the film has \"beautifully choreographed moments, and the action sequences won't disappoint any fans of slow-motion fistfights and arteries that gush like fire hydrants\". Independent film critic Emanuel Levy wrote that Crowe's \"commanding performance\" and his chemistry with Liu lift the film slightly above the routine. Levy said that the film is an \"ultra-violent movie that blends thrilling martial arts sequences, orchestrated and executed by some of the masters of this specific milieu, with a semi-involving tale\" that would be appreciated by a young, indiscriminating audience. Leonard Maltin of IndieWire said that \"RZA's understated performance isn't bad, but his staging of action leaves something to be desired\", and that the film imitates earlier kung-fu films, which it fails to improve upon."

The Pyross have red skin, and stocky, muscular features; water burns their flesh and rain is lethal to them. They use sunstones (shining crystals) as both money and energy source. During the rainy season, they stay locked in their city of stone and cannot get out; they protect themselves from the rain and from the wild water dragons who wander into Pyross territory during the rainy season. The Hydross, on the other hand, have curvy features and blue or turquoise skin, and water is vital to them. In summer, the Hydross turn into stone statues and are thus vulnerable, while the Pyross can get out and venture into Hydross territory to destroy as many Hydross statues as they can before the rainy season starts again. The two people know very little about one another, and they cannot even touch one another, as the contact of Hydross skin burns the Pyross, and vice versa. Peace between Hydross and Pyross seems impossible, but two young people, a Pyross named Skan and a young Hydross, Kallisto, meet one another in improbable circumstances and try desperately to stop the eternal war."

To save money, George buys a chair from Delaware, but it doesn't arrive in time so they go to Joe Mayo's party without it. Elaine is embarrassed by David Puddy having a fur coat, so when she is placed in charge of the coats, Elaine secretly throws Puddy's fur coat out the window. She later finds out she dispatched Joe's near-identical coat instead. When he finds out it is gone, Joe demands Elaine buy him a new coat. Kramer and Newman reverse the peepholes on their apartment doors to spot any ambushes inside their rooms. When the super, Silvio, learns they did this without his authorization, he assumes Newman instigated it. He only refrains from evicting Newman because Kramer speaks on his behalf. Kramer notices Newman is having an affair with Silvio's wife, and realizes he and Newman will both be evicted if Silvio finds out. At Kramer's suggestion, Jerry throws out his wallet and just folds his bills together, saving pocket space. He mocks George for having a wallet that is so stuffed with coupons that it gives him back pain. The massage chair is delivered to George by mistake. When he discovers how good it is for his back pain, he delays giving it to Joe. When Jerry complains about having to carry around his girlfriend's things, Elaine gives him a European carry-all, which resembles a purse. Kramer spots the fur coat in a tree and Newman retrieves it. Kramer mentions this to Elaine. She tries to convince Newman to give her Joe's coat, but he has already given it to Silvio's wife. Silvio finds his wife in possession of the fur coat. Assuming it is a gift from Newman, Silvio threatens to evict Kramer and Newman over the affair. To save himself, Kramer claims the fur coat is Jerry's, and gets Jerry to wear it in front of Silvio. Silvio believes him until Elaine walks up and asks why Jerry is wearing Joe's coat. Silvio then plots revenge on Joe. A thief snatches Jerry's carry-all. Jerry calls to a policeman, but the policeman does not know what a European carry-all is, so Jerry has to describe it as his \"purse\". Elaine, Jerry, and Kramer back out of participating in their chair gift (Elaine because Joe demanded she buy him a new coat, Jerry because Joe criticized his taste in music, and Kramer because he has no recollection of agreeing to the gift). George plans to return the chair. When he puts a tear-away phone number for a free guitar lesson in his already overstuffed wallet, much of the contents burst out and blow away, including the receipt. Silvio ambushes Joe from inside his room with a sock of pennies. Seeing how ostentatious Jerry looks in the fur coat, Puddy sells his fur coat and buys a garish leather eight-ball jacket."

Spike Feresten, the episode's writer, remarked that wallets had become pointless, and Seinfeld co-creator/writer/star Jerry Seinfeld began arguing the point with him. Feresten won over Seinfeld by dumping out the contents of Seinfeld's wallet and showing him how much of its contents he had no real use for. George developing back pain from his wallet proved to be true to life; sitting with the massive wallet in his back pocket during the episode's rehearsals and filming caused George actor Jason Alexander to hurt his back. The wallet bursting open at the episode's climax was accomplished by a stunt man firing an air gun precisely at the wallet. The reference to Stein Eriksen was added to the script by Jerry Seinfeld."

Every item in the auction is sold to an English widow named Edith Knickertwist, who is bidding over the phone. When the auction is over, Bart reveals that he was the real Mrs. Knickertwist and that there is no money for the school. Frustrated over Bart's latest prank and pressured by his supervisor Superintendent Chalmers, Principal Skinner challenges Chalmers to take over Bart's education. Chalmers accepts and immediately gives Bart his own lesson plan, which primarily consists of former U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt. He makes Bart interested in the subject by talking about Roosevelt's heroic and rebellious nature.  Classmates Milhouse, Nelson, Jimbo, Kearney and Dolph soon join Bart in his education. With the success of his lessons, Chalmers plans to take them all on a field trip to Springfield Forest, in which Roosevelt left one of his spectacles. The field trip does not go well, however, as Nelson breaks his arm when he tries to reach for the spectacles. Since it was an unauthorized field trip, Nelson's mother threatens to sue the school for medical expenses, which leads to Chalmers getting fired. In order to save Chalmers' job, Bart and his friends, who now go by the name \"The Brotherhood of the Spectacles\", take over the school in a hostage situation and stand up for the teacher who made a meaningful impact to them. They lock all of the teachers out of the school and demand that Chalmers get reinstated. A SWAT team prepares to storm the school, before Chalmers walks up to convince Bart to stop. Luckily, Chief Wiggum accidentally drops his gun, knee-capping the school representative State Comptroller Atkins, who thereafter agrees to reinstate Chalmers because they can recover the money lost in the previous lawsuit with a new lawsuit against the police department. With Chalmers' job saved, Bart continues his lessons with him."

        "content": "Canadian animator and creator of The Ren & Stimpy Show, John Kricfalusi, guest animated the couch gag for the episode. This was the second time The Simpsons had chosen a guest director for its opening sequence, following the previous season's episode \"MoneyBART\", which was guest-directed by British graffiti artist and political activist Banksy. Previously, Kricfalusi had criticized The Simpsons staff in the show's early years by saying that \"the show succeeded despite the writing\" and similarly derogatory comments. The producers responded with the fourth season episode \"The Front\" (1993), in which The Ren & Stimpy Show is nominated for a cartoon award. During the award ceremony, the clip from the nominated episode is merely a black screen with the text \"Clip not done yet\", a comment on the slow production time of the show. The show was mentioned again in the season six episode \"Another Simpsons Clip Show\" (1994), when Lisa claims that Ren & Stimpy recycles animation to make new episodes, while referencing Itchy & Scratchy's habit of doing the same. Despite this, Kricfalusi changed his tone in an interview with Aaron Simpson in 2007 and claimed that The Simpsons made it easier to do more edgy work: \"Well it started with Bakshi\u2019s Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures and Pee Wee Herman. Those were kid shows, but with layers of perversion in them. Then The Simpsons came along and did edgy material in prime time cartoons.\" After the positive response to the opening sequence by Banksy, creator Matt Groening and Jean came to Kricfalusi and asked him if he could do something similar. Originally, they only wanted him to do the storyboards and then let their regular crew animate it, but Kricfalusi insisted on doing the animation himself, explaining that \"If we had done it that way, no one would even have known that I had anything to do with it because it would have ended up on model and all pose to pose\".  On The Simpsons, the animators draw key poses and then let tweeners interpolate between those poses. The interpolation however, is a straight a to b animation. That way the animation ends up having the characters just going from pose to pose. Kricfalusi explains that on The Simpsons he \"wanted to try moving the characters in crazy fun ways, not just looking funny each time they come to a stop\", and further elaborated \"that the way things happened was even more important than what was happening in my work. You can\u2019t write visual performance. You have to actually draw it.\" He showed Groening and Jean his Adult Swim shorts and Groening responded by giving him free hands to do the 35-second-long segment.  Groening told him to break all The Simpsons rules, but Kricfalusi explains that he \"tried not to break any rules in the characters\u2019 personalities, just in the execution of the visuals. I didn't follow any models\u2014not even my own\". The more rules he broke, the more pleased Groening and Jean were with the result. Contrary to Banksy, who works in secrecy, Kricfalusi was involved in every detail and even oversaw the dubbing of the final soundtrack. While Kricfalusi animated the 2D parts, he had John Kedzie to help him with the computer graphics and Sarah Harkey and Tommy Tanner to do the assistant animation. In an interview by Neil Bennett from Digital Arts Magazine, Kricfalusi revealed that he would have taken a different approach to the animation if he were to animate the entire episode. Primarily, the animation would be slower paced than it was in the 35-second-long segment. The couch gag was done at a faster pace so he was able to include all of his ideas. Kricfalusi explains that \"[if I did a whole episode], I would definitely keep on experimenting with the way they move and the acting. I'm sure I would do of my trademark long scenes of two characters interacting with each other without a cut. I would [also] want to do more stuff with Marge. I loved animating her and was inspired by the way the Fleischers animated Olive Oyl. I couldn't animate a whole half hour myself, so I would hire other animators (and designers, painters, etc.) with strong styles and cast them according to which parts of the story would best take advantage of their individual talent.\""

Since airing, \"Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts\" has been well received by television critics. Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club gave this episode a \"B\" rating and commented that \"The Simpsons episodes that strive to have a little heart without going overboard are generally going to work better than the random-gag episodes, at least at this point in the storied history of The Simpsons, and 'Bart Stops To Smell The Roosevelts' has enough wee little heart to see this episode through\", but further wrote that \"there were a number of jokes that didn't work, Milhouse's final scene in particular, but the episode had a steady stream of gags to push through the lean times. And that's all we can ask for.\" Ology's Josh Harrison was also positive and gave the episode a rating of seven out of ten, while commenting that he \"thought this was a definite downgrade from the season premiere in terms of sheer comedic value, but the sincerity of Bart's educational experience, combined with the enthusiasm of his mad quest for justice, definitely made this one a winner.\" The couch gag for the episode was acclaimed by television critics. Amid Amidi of Cartoon Brew called the opening revolutionary and explained that \"in 35 short and sweet seconds, he liberates the animation of The Simpsons from years of graphic banality.\" He continued: \"The visual look of the show, which has been so carefully controlled by its producers, becomes a giddy and unrestrained playground for graphic play, and the balance of creative authority is shifted from the writers' room to the animators in one fell swoop.\" When comparing the segment to Banksy's, Amidi concluded that it is \"in fact, far more subversive because he focuses almost exclusively on making a pictorial statement, relegating the show's dominant literary elements to the back seat.\" Similarly, Television Blend's Katey Rich wrote that she appreciates \"The Simpsons always being willing to push the envelope in different ways\", but admitted that it would take her \"some time to get the gangly-legged Marge Simpson and the leering Homer Simpson out of [her] brain.\" Tim Long was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Writing in Animation at the 64th Writers Guild of America Awards for his script to this episode."

There, they discover that a Ganger of the Eleventh Doctor exists. Rory has gone off alone to find the emotionally distraught Jennifer. The Ganger Jennifer kills the real Jennifer, and then stages a fight with another Ganger Jennifer to fool Rory that she is the human version. Ganger Jennifer leads Rory to a console, claiming it will restore power when instead it disables the cooling system for the acid, making it dangerously unstable. She then convinces Rory to lead the human group into the acid storage chamber and traps them inside; crewman Jimmy is killed trying to stall the acid release. Using a video call for Jimmy's son Adam, the Doctor convinces the Ganger Jimmy and the other Gangers they are just as real as their human counterparts. Ganger Jennifer becomes furious at this display and rages off; the other Gangers agree to work with the humans to escape the facility. They free the humans trapped in the acid storage room, and race off through the crypts below the monastery, chased by a savage Ganger Jennifer who has transformed herself into a monster. Ganger Cleaves and the Ganger Doctor hold the door to allow the Doctor, Amy, Rory, human Cleaves, Ganger Jimmy and Ganger Dicken to escape to the TARDIS. The Cleaves and Doctor Gangers together face the monster, triggering a sonic screwdriver at the right moment to cause them and the monster to dissolve back into liquid. Aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor indefinitely stabilises the Gangers' forms to ensure that they remain human permanently. Ganger Jimmy goes to meet Adam, and Cleaves and Dicken go to their headquarters where they plan to reveal the truth of the Flesh to humanity. As the TARDIS crew turns to leave, Amy starts feeling contractions. Back aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor admits his trip to the factory was planned: he wanted to investigate the Flesh in its raw form, as he has known for some time that Amy is a Ganger herself. He promises her that he will find her and then disrupts her form, turning her back to raw Flesh. Amy wakes up pregnant in a pristine white tube, observed by the \"Eye Patch Lady\", and starts entering labour."

He wanted each character to be different and did not want all of them to become evil, and the Doctor would help them discover their humanity. Graham wanted Jennifer to be the antagonist as he liked the idea of the quietest character becoming the most evil. The original script explained that she has a perfect memory, and so her Ganger was able to remember every terrible thing that had happened to the Flesh. Several other sequences were cut from the final version of \"The Almost People\". In the original script, the Doctor quizzes the Flesh Doctor about the events of The Mind of Evil (1971) and mentions former companions Jo Grant, Sarah Jane Smith, Romana, Rose Tyler, Martha Jones, and Donna Noble. There was also a montage of happy memories of the Doctor's life stored in the Flesh Doctor, which included flashbacks of previous episodes and serials of the show as well as events that had not transpired onscreen. Also cut was the TARDIS providing the Doctor with another sonic screwdriver after he had given it to the Flesh Doctor, in a similar fashion to \"The Eleventh Hour\". The cliffhanger resolves several plot threads that had been seeded throughout the previous episodes of the series. According to executive producer Beth Willis, the Amy Pond Ganger has been acting in place of the original Amy Pond since the beginning of the series.  Amy claimed she was pregnant in \"The Impossible Astronaut\", but denied this in the following episode. Since then, the Doctor has performed several inconclusive pregnancy tests on Amy. The Eye Patch Lady, who was later revealed to be named Madame Kovarian in the episode \"A Good Man Goes To War\", previously made brief appearances in \"Day of the Moon\", \"The Curse of the Black Spot\", and \"The Rebel Flesh\". Gillan discussed the labour scene with her mother, and tried to make it \"really horrific\"."

        "content": "The read-through for \"The Rebel Flesh\" and \"The Almost People\" took place on 12 November 2010. It was then filmed through November and January 2011. The cold temperatures at the time were a challenge and caused discomfort. The crew were concerned that the cast, particularly the three lead actors, would fall ill as their costumes were not designed for such weather conditions. Even so, the cast remained healthy. Scenes outside and inside the monastery were filmed at Caerphilly Castle. Other production problems included the director hurting himself and being snowed in. The crypt where the acid container was held was filmed in the same set that had been previously used as the Oval Office in \"The Impossible Astronaut\"/\"Day of the Moon. The actors each played their respective Gangers, with prosthetics applied to their faces for when the duplicates' faces reverted to the original material of the Flesh. For the scenes in which both the character and their respective Ganger was in the same shot, a double for each of the actors was used. Most of the shots showed either the character or their Ganger speaking over their counterpart's shoulder, as only the backs of the doubles' head were made to look similar to the actors. Smith had a voice double and a body double; the former would read the other Doctor's lines on set. The episode also marked the first time Smith wore prosthetic make-up. The unique contortions of the Gangers were achieved through computer-generated imagery done by The Mill. It was originally planned that Jennifer would eat Buzzer, but The Mill decided only the shadows of the action would be shown on the wall. All of this was cut from the final episode, with the exception of Jennifer's elongated mouth as she advanced towards him. The pile of discarded Jennifer Gangers was originally intended to just be a pile of bodies, but it was decided that would be \"too grim\". Instead, life-sized dolls were used and computer-generated Flesh was painted on it, giving it a more melted look. The monster Jennifer transforms into at the end was created with CGI and a photo of pop singer Madonna was used as reference, as in the image \"here arms were...really sinewy, white, veiny, and fleshy\". Graham wanted the creature to have a real face and an alien body; he was inspired by a drawing in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland that depicted Alice with a long neck. Sarah Smart was filmed in front of a greenscreen maneuvering like the monster, which was used as reference."

        "content": "Dan Martin of The Guardian thought that it \"feels a bit uneven, though it's worth saying that it's one of those where everything makes more sense on second viewing\". He also felt that the cliffhanger may have overshadowed the episode itself. However, he went on to describe the Gangers as \"memorable\" and \"an exercise in moral dilemmas\". He later rated it the ninth best episode of the series, though the finale was not included in the list. Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph described it as a \"taut, claustrophobic, sci-fi thriller\", and as an \"impressive episode with its neatly realised psychological and body horror\". Both Martin and Fuller were less generous of Jennifer's monster transformation. Martin commented \"this dark, thoughtful story is restored to camp running-for-your-life-around-some-corridors\", and Fuller called it \"something of a pity\". Neela Debnath of The Independent particularly praised Smith, stating that he \"excels in his acting, managing to be reassuring and threatening, hilarious and sinister all within the same few scenes\". However, though she praised the cliffhanger, she thought it \"eclipsed\" the episode. Radio Times writer Patrick Mulkern thought that there were \"points of logic\" which might be questioned, but they were \"minor points to wrestle with in a largely polished production\". Keith Phipps, reviewing for The A.V. Club, gave the episode a B and called it a \"pretty good follow-up\". IGN's Matt Risely rated \"The Almost People\" 8 out of 10, noting that \"As a traditional two-parter, Matthew Graham wrote a tight and coherent but not entirely scintillating script that managed to 'flesh' out the themes of morality and humanity with a couple of interesting touches\". Though he called the cliffhanger a \"perfectly pitched WTF moment\", he too believed that it \"detracts from the episode as a whole\". Richard Edwards of SFX was more critical of the episode, giving it three out of five stars. He stated he did not feel any \"genuine threat\" and considered the Gangers to be \"uninteresting\" and \"predictable\". However, he did praise Smith's performance and the cliffhanger. Digital Spy listed the cliffhanger among five best of Doctor Who since its revival in 2005, explaining, \"it changes everything you thought you knew about the latest series, and it's damn creepy\"."

After parking his car at a sidewalk by the place, he was immediately flagged down by the bellhop who tells him that parking there is not permitted. As a solution, Oswald compresses his car with his hands until it is hand-sized. The rabbit drops the tiny vehicle in his shorts and gives the bellhop a raspberry before proceeding to the club's entrance. Coming to the night club also was Pete. Holding onto his long-johns is his cub son who refuses to separate from him. Frustrated by the persistent holding, Pete puts his offspring inside long-johns and hangs it on a light post. The cub was able to come out of the long-johns but was saddened upon losing sight of his father. He came to the night club's entrance and asked \"Is my father in there?\" A voice from inside tells him not to stay by the doors. The cub would ask the same question to a number of people but would never get the answer he wanted. Inside the night club, the patrons are dancing as a band plays the tune Alexander's Ragtime Band. Everyone appears to be having a pleasant time, especially Oswald who stands on a chair, rocking it back and forth. The next event features four dogs in tuxedos who sing part of the song Sweet Adeline on stage. However, their performance wasn't well received by the guests. Still enjoying the atmosphere nonetheless, Oswald dances on his table. Sitting by and sharing his table is Pete. As he dances, the rabbit accidentally kicks Pete in the nose, much to the latter's disturbance. Pete then grabs Oswald's head and rips it off his body. Miraculously, Oswald survives and is able to put himself back together. As retribution, Oswald throws a jar on Pete head. While Pete tries to take the jar off his head, a cow laughs at him. As a response, Pete kicks the cow, who in turn, gets laughed at by a mouse. The cow spits at the mouse who then gets laughed at by an elephant. The mouse pulls the elephant's trunk and lets go, causing that animal to trample on the other guests. As a result, everyone gets into a fist fight. Some patrons were able to flee but the rest remained in the trouble. A police car arrives at the scene and takes the whole night club building away. Knowing his father is still inside, the cub tries to follow the moving building but cannot keep up. As he stops, he comes across an opaque telephone booth at a park. The cub asks his question but only receives silence. Desperate, he rips open the booth only to find a Tibetan dog making a phone call inside."

Harry, a former war correspondent, accepts the attractive deal and sets off to Soviet Russia only to fall in love with a country quite different from the picture shown by the \"free press\" in its Cold War adversary. Back in the United States, Harry finds himself torn by a dilemma between his consciousness as an honest journalist, and the menacing pressure of his superiors, forcing him to write a convenient untruth. Keeping its ideological design in mind, The Russian Question remains a sophisticated and objective, if somewhat critical portrayal of American Cold War political society. Unlike many other Soviet propaganda films, Romm's drama takes on an American perspective, only showing the Soviet Union discussed in the movie for a short combination of shots.

She tries to identify the individual by observing the group's reactions to a horror story. In her story, a couple, played by Britta and Jeff (Joel McHale), makes out in a car until an escaped psychopath attacks. Abed (Danny Pudi) criticizes the story as cliched and offers an improved version. The group proceeds to tell their own \"horror\" stories, all taking place in a cabin. In Abed's story, he and Britta visit a secluded cabin. Abed takes every logical precaution, such as bringing a radio and awaiting the escaped psychopath by standing back-to-back holding knives, boring everyone. In Annie's (Alison Brie) romantic story, she is a schoolteacher who tames Jeff, a vampire, by teaching him how to read. When Jeff turns on Annie, she reveals herself to be a werewolf and mutilates him, horrifying the group. In Troy's (Donald Glover) story, he and Abed are airplane pilots who encounter a doctor, Pierce (Chevy Chase), who sews them together. However, this gives Troy and Abed psychokinetic powers, with which they knock Pierce unconscious. As revenge, they sew Pierce's buttocks to his chest and swap his hands and feet, creeping out the group. In Pierce's story, he is a stud surrounded by hot women \u2013 Annie, Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown), and Britta. When Abed and Troy, as stereotypical hood film characters, invade his home, Pierce easily subdues them, baffling the group. In Shirley's story, the Rapture occurs while the other group members party and use drugs. The Devil, portrayed by Dean Pelton (Jim Rash), enters, but Shirley holds him off temporarily before rising to Heaven, leaving the others to be tortured, offending the group. Bored, the group tries to leave. Britta stops them by revealing the test results and explaining how the disturbed individual could kill them. Her gruesome descriptions and the flickering lights create alarm. To calm everyone down, Jeff tells a story wherein a hookman attacks the group. After questioning by Jeff, the hookman reveals himself to be Chang (Ken Jeong) and asks for a hug, and the group accepts him warmly. Jeff's story, however, fails to calm his friends, as they think he's trying to divert attention away from himself. Jeff admits he filled out his test paper randomly, frustrating the group. Annie checks the papers and realizes Britta scanned them upside down. The corrected results reveal that every group member except one is crazy. The group decides not to determine who it is so they can each hope they are the sane one. The final shot reveals that Abed was the one member of the group who tested as sane."

In Abed's story, he fixes all plot holes by having his characters take all logical precautions to minimize the chance of being killed. Annie's imagining of Jeff as a vampire who uses Britta for sustenance is a poke at the Twilight series. The scene where Annie teaches Jeff to read is reminiscent of a similar scene in Beauty and the Beast. Shirley's story involves the Rapture, wherein she goes to heaven, leaving behind the rest of the group, whom she perceives as hedonistic. Also in her story is Dean Pelton as the Devil with a chainsaw yelling \"Gay marriage!\" At the start of the episode, Annie goes through Britta's playlist and finds the Beetlejuice soundtrack in it. A man in a Beetlejuice costume then passes behind Annie as she says the name aloud for the third time in the show's history (\"Beetlejuice\" was also mentioned in \"Communication Studies\" by Professor Slater and in \"Cooperative Calligraphy\" by Britta). In the film, whenever someone says \"Beetlejuice\" three times, the character Betelgeuse would suddenly enter the scene. Abed is dressed-up as Inspector Spacetime, the show's interpretation of Doctor Who. Jeff dresses up for Halloween by wearing a \"Fast and the Furious jacket.\" At one point Troy wants to go the party because he heard the Dean has \"free taco meat from the Army\". This is a reference to the second-season episode \"Epidemiology\" in which army surplus food the Dean acquired gave people zombie-like attributes. As Britta explains that an untreated psychopath could murder anyone in the group, her murder is portrayed while she is reading \"Warren Piece.\""

The series takes place in the fictional seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, in which the residents are actually characters from various fairy tales that were transported to the \"real world\" town by a powerful curse. In this episode, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) becomes upset when told by Archie (Raphael Sbarge) that his fairy tale theories are delusions; Henry places himself in danger when he investigates a mysterious sinkhole, forcing a regretful Archie to save him. Meanwhile, the backstory of Jiminy Cricket (Sbarge) is revealed \u2013 he yearns to leave his con artist parents and become a good person, but accidentally hurts an innocent couple along the way. It was the first Once Upon a Time episode to be written by consulting producer Jane Espenson, while being directed by Paul Edwards. Espenson was \"thrilled\" to be assigned the episode; Jiminy Cricket was typically a character that appeared in other people's stories, so she was eager to explore him in his own narrative. Espenson especially wanted to depict how some, like Jiminy in this episode, \"have their adolescence well after adolescence. It took Jiminy a long time to figure out how to get away from the life he was living, and I think a lot of people feel like that.\" In addition, the episode contained several cultural references to the television series Lost and the Disney film One Hundred and One Dalmatians. \"That Still Small Voice\" first aired in the United States on November 27, 2011, with the network ABC. An estimated 10.7 million viewers watched the episode, helping it finish in third place for its timeslot. \"That Still Small Voice\" finished in fourteenth place for the week among the major networks. Since then, it has garnered generally positive critical reviews. Many praised Espenson's screenwriting, as well as Jiminy's characterization and the performances of Sbarge and Robert Carlyle."

As for the cursed dolls, they end up as a collection at Mr. Gold's (Carlyle) pawn shop."

        "content": "In the present day, Dr. Archie Hopper (Sbarge) continues to evaluate Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), who is still trying to convince him that he is Jiminy. Meanwhile, Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) officially makes Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) his new deputy. An explosion soon after causes the town to shake, followed by a sinkhole that emerges at an abandoned mine shaft. As Emma, Henry, Archie, and the sheriff show up to see the damaged area, Regina (Lana Parrilla) arrives to try to keep everyone from going any further, then comes across a certain object which looks like an ornate piece of glass and puts it in her pocket. She is also not pleased with the sheriff hiring Emma, and also reminds Archie that she can have him fired and out on the streets if he fails to succeed in dissuading Henry of the veracity of the fairy tale stories. The next day, Archie follows through on Regina's warning by convincing Henry that the fairy tale stories are not real, upsetting Henry. This prompts Emma to pay a visit to Archie as she figures out that Regina was responsible for threatening him. Emma accuses Regina of threatening Archie, but Regina says that Henry is missing again. Archie conjectures that Henry may have gone back to the mine shaft. There, Henry begins to investigate the area and comes across a glass item similar to the one Regina found earlier that he puts into his backpack. Archie goes in to search for Henry and finds the boy, but as they try to escape, an aftershock blocks off the main entrance, leaving an injured Archie and Henry trapped. They find an elevator shaft, not knowing that above ground Emma and Regina have taken the suggestion of blasting the main entrance from Marco (Tony Amendola), which results in the elevator carrying Henry and Archie being lowered even further after the blast takes place. Inside the elevator, Henry asks Archie why he refuses to believe that he is Jiminy Cricket. Archie acknowledges that he might share Jiminy's personality and in a similar fashion to his alternative past, yearn to be free from being told what to do. Meanwhile, above ground, Emma finds the opening of the elevator shaft and volunteers to go down the shaft, where she succeeds in rescuing Henry and Archie. Archie tells Regina that he will continue to see Henry and that if she attempts to interfere he will take action against Regina and have her declared an unfit mother. Regina backs down after Archie's threat, she looks at the object she had in her pocket and throws it down the shaft, where it is revealed that it is a small shard of the infamous glass coffin of Snow White's (Ginnifer Goodwin). Concurrent with these events, Mary Margaret (Goodwin) continues to visit the amnesiac David (Joshua Dallas) at the hospital. At the same time, Kathryn (Anastasia Griffith) also continues to visit David, showing him pictures to jog his memory but later admits to Mary Margaret that he doesn't remember anything that he saw in the pictures, although he claimed otherwise when talking with Kathryn. As Mary Margaret notices David becoming more attracted to her, she still feels threatened by Kathryn's presence. This prompts Mary Margaret to submit her letter of resignation as a volunteer at the hospital."

        "content": "\"That Still Small Voice\" was the first Once Upon a Time episode written by consulting producer Jane Espenson. She was drawn to join the series because she believed a curse involving fairy tale characters was a \"fantastic concept\". She explained, \"What's the modern take on Jiminy Cricket and Rumpelstiltskin? What would their issues be in the real world? The beauty of the production, the care and the effort and, honestly, the expense that was put into it just made clear that was a project done with a lot of attention and love.\" The episode was directed by Lost veteran Paul Edwards. \"That Still Small Voice\", featuring Jiminy Cricket, was assigned to Espenson, and she was \"thrilled to get it,\" as she wanted to explore the character in his own story. She elaborated that Jiminy is Actor Raphael Sbarge became attracted to join the series because he would effectively be helping tell two stories, one in a fantasy world and the other in a modern setting. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Sbarge compared Once Upon a Time to the television series Lost \"in that they have a large ensemble and what they do is that they take a few characters and they kind of take them, effectively on a deep dive.\" When Sbarge read the script for \"That Still Small Voice\", he was worried about \"treading into people's imaginations,\" but ultimately decided that \"they cast me for a reason because there are some qualities in me that they obviously recognize for the story they want to tell.\" Believing that his character was \"sort of a surrogate father figure\" to Henry, Sbarge admitted that the script \"made me weep because what they came up with is so lovely and magical and delightful.\" Referring to his character's storyline as a hero's journey, Sbarge said the intention was to show that Jiminy Cricket did not just begin as a noble guy \u2013 \"what you get to see on this trip are the fire rings he had to walk through to get to a place where he could evolve to develop a sense of doing the right thing.\" The episode featured guest stars Harry Groener and Carolyn Hennesy as Jiminy's parents Martin and Myrna. Groener had previously worked with Espenson in the third season of the fantasy television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is their only appearances in the series. The episode contains several cultural references and allusions. The scenes in which Henry was carrying a couple of Apollo Chocolate Candy Bars in his back pack was also the same brand of candy bars made by the DHARMA Initiative on Lost, while Archie's pet Pongo is also the name of one of the dogs in the Disney film One Hundred and One Dalmatians. The episode's title, \"That Still Small Voice\", is an apparent allusion, or reference to a Biblical passage in the Books of Kings: \"but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.\""

        "content": "The episode was met with generally positive reviews. Writing for AOL TV, Laura Prudom noted that the episode \"proved to be an undeniably satisfying hour of television, deepening our understanding of Archie/Jiminy's character and giving us some welcome development in Mary Margaret and David's tragic romance. I don't know about you, but I really could watch a whole hour of those two playing hangman and innocently flirting and need nothing else from the show.\" Entertainment Weekly columnist Shaunna Murphy wrote that while she \"ragged on Robert Carlyle initially, his campy Rumpel is quickly becoming one of my favorite parts of this show.\" Tor.com's Teresa Jusino called Espenson's script \"so engaging\" because it deviated from the series' typical two-story format and \"incorporated a third, separate modern storyline\" that featured other characters in addition to Jiminy Cricket, in which \"each storyline got just enough attention.\" She added that the episode's best parts were its \"intimate character moments, particularly the scenes between Archie/Jiminy and the boys in his life,\" and attributed this to Espenson's strength as a writer. Jusino felt another highlight was Sbarge's performance, as he \"navigated both Archie and Jiminy\u2019s journeys from being pawns to being their own men with precision and warmth.\" Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club graded the episode with a C. He criticized Gilmore's performance in \"That Still Small Voice\" and earlier episodes, writing that \"Gilmore struggles to make a connection with his character, so it always looks like he\u2019s reading lines,\" which might have a negative effect on the Henry's character development. Sava felt that Espenson, based on her previous work, was good at balancing large casts and wrote \"this episode juggles the expansive character roster of this series better than its predecessors.\" Conversely, IGN's Amy Ratcliffe said she has \"never liked Henry as much as I did in this episode,\" especially his explanation to Archie on why he is Jiminy Cricket. Ratcliffe added that Jiminy had the \"most touching backstory\" of the season up to that point, opining that \"the transformation of Dr. Hopper was moving, and this episode maybe felt the most like a fairytale of the stories we've seen so far.\" She graded \"That Still Small Voice\" with 8 out of 10, an indication of a \"great\" episode."

        "content": "The Last of Us is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. Players control Joel, a smuggler tasked with escorting a teenage girl, Ellie, across a post-apocalyptic United States. The Last of Us is played from a third-person perspective. Players use firearms and improvised weapons, and can use stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated fungus in the genus Cordyceps. In the online multiplayer mode, up to eight players engage in cooperative and competitive gameplay. Development of The Last of Us began in 2009, soon after the release of Naughty Dog's previous game, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. For the first time in the company's history, Naughty Dog split into two teams; while one team developed Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, the other half developed The Last of Us. The relationship between Joel and Ellie became the focus, with all other elements developed around it. Actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson portrayed Joel and Ellie, respectively, through voice and motion capture, and assisted creative director Neil Druckmann with the development of the characters and story. The original score was composed and performed by Gustavo Santaolalla. Following its announcement in December 2011, The Last of Us was widely anticipated. It was released for the PlayStation 3 in June 2013; a remastered version was released for the PlayStation 4 in July 2014. It received critical acclaim, with praise going to narrative, gameplay, visuals, sound design, characterization, and depiction of female characters. The Last of Us became one of the best-selling video games, selling over 1.3 million units in its first week and 17 million by April 2018. The game won year-end accolades, including multiple Game of the Year awards, from several gaming publications, critics, and game award ceremonies. It has been cited as one of the greatest video games ever made. Naughty Dog released several downloadable content additions; The Last of Us: Left Behind adds a single-player campaign following Ellie and her best friend Riley. The Last of Us Part II, a sequel, was released in June 2020. A television adaptation is currently in production by HBO, written by Druckmann and Craig Mazin and starring Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie."

        "content": "The Last of Us is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective. The player traverses post-apocalyptic environments such as towns, buildings, forests, and sewers to advance the story. The player can use firearms, improvised weapons, and stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. For most of the game, the player takes control of Joel, a man tasked with escorting a young girl, Ellie, across the United States. The player also controls Ellie throughout the game's winter segment, and briefly controls Joel's daughter Sarah in the opening sequence. In combat, the player can use long-range weapons, such as a rifle, a shotgun, and a bow, and short-range weapons such as a handgun and a short-barreled shotgun. The player is able to scavenge limited-use melee weapons, such as pipes and baseball bats, and throw bottles and bricks to distract, stun, or attack enemies. The player can upgrade weapons at workbenches using collected items. Equipment such as health kits, shivs, and Molotov cocktails can be found or crafted using collected items. Attributes such as the health meter and crafting speed can be upgraded by collecting pills and medicinal plants. Health can be recharged by finding edible items or through the use of health kits. Though the player can attack enemies directly, they can also use stealth to attack undetected or sneak by them. \"Listen Mode\" allows the player to locate enemies through a heightened sense of hearing and spatial awareness, indicated as outlines visible through walls and objects. In the dynamic cover system, the player can crouch behind obstacles to gain a tactical advantage during combat. The game features periods without combat, often involving conversation between the characters. The player can solve simple puzzles, such as using floating pallets to move Ellie, who is unable to swim, across bodies of water, and using ladders or dumpsters to reach higher areas. Story collectibles, such as notes, maps and comics, can be scavenged and viewed in the backpack menu. The game features an artificial intelligence system by which hostile human enemies react to combat. If enemies discover the player, they may take cover or call for assistance, and can take advantage of the player when they are distracted, out of ammunition, or in a fight. Player companions, such as Ellie, can assist in combat by throwing objects at threats to stun them, announcing the location of unseen enemies, or using a knife and pistol to attack enemies."

        "content": "In 2013, an outbreak of a mutant Cordyceps fungus ravages the United States, transforming its human hosts into aggressive creatures known as the Infected. In the suburbs of Austin, Texas, Joel (Troy Baker) flees the chaos with his brother Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce) and daughter Sarah (Hana Hayes). As they flee, Sarah is shot by a soldier and dies in Joel's arms. Twenty years later, civilization has been decimated by the infection. Survivors live in totalitarian quarantine zones, independent settlements, and nomadic groups, leaving buildings and houses deserted. Joel works as a smuggler with his partner Tess (Annie Wersching) in the quarantine zone in the North End of Boston, Massachusetts. They hunt down Robert (Robin Atkin Downes), a black-market dealer, to recover a stolen weapons cache. Before Tess kills him, Robert reveals that he traded the cache with the Fireflies, a rebel militia opposing the quarantine zone authorities. The leader of the Fireflies, Marlene (Merle Dandridge), promises to double their cache in return for smuggling a teenage girl, Ellie (Ashley Johnson), to Fireflies hiding in the Massachusetts State House outside the quarantine zone. Joel, Tess, and Ellie sneak out in the night, but after an encounter with a government patrol, they discover Ellie is infected. Symptoms normally occur within two days, but Ellie claims she was infected three weeks earlier and that her immunity may lead to a cure. The trio make their way to their destination through hordes of the infected, but find that the Fireflies there have been killed. Tess reveals she has been bitten by an infected and, believing in Ellie's importance, sacrifices herself against pursuing soldiers so Joel and Ellie can escape. Joel decides to find Tommy, a former Firefly, in the hope that he can locate the remaining Fireflies. With the help of Bill (W. Earl Brown), a smuggler and survivalist who owes Joel a favor, they acquire a working vehicle from Bill's neighborhood. Driving into Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Joel and Ellie are ambushed by bandits, and their car is wrecked. They ally with two brothers, Henry (Brandon Scott) and Sam (Nadji Jeter). After they escape the city, Sam is bitten but hides it from the group. As his infection takes hold, Sam attacks Ellie, but Henry shoots him dead before taking his own life. In the fall, Joel and Ellie finally find Tommy in Jackson, Wyoming, where he has assembled a fortified settlement near a hydroelectric dam with his wife Maria (Ashley Scott). Joel decides to leave Ellie with Tommy, but after she confronts him about Sarah, he lets her stay with him. Tommy directs them to a Fireflies enclave at the University of Eastern Colorado. They find the university abandoned, but learn that the Fireflies have moved to a hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah. The two are attacked by bandits, and Joel is severely wounded while escaping. During the winter, Ellie and Joel shelter in the mountains. Joel is on the brink of death and relies on Ellie to care for him. Hunting for food, Ellie encounters David (Nolan North) and James (Reuben Langdon), scavengers willing to trade medicine for food. David turns hostile after revealing the university bandits were part of his group. Ellie manages to lead David's group away from Joel, but is captured; David intends to recruit her into his cannibal group. Refusing, she escapes after killing James, but David corners her in a burning restaurant. Meanwhile, Joel recovers from his wounds and sets out to find Ellie. He reaches her just as she kills David with a machete, an act that traumatizes her, and Joel comforts her before they flee. In the spring, Joel and Ellie arrive in Salt Lake City. Ellie is rendered unconscious after almost drowning before they are captured by a Firefly patrol. In the hospital, Marlene tells Joel that Ellie is being prepared for surgery: in hope of producing a vaccine for the infection, the Fireflies must remove the infected portion of Ellie's brain, which will kill her. Unwilling to let Ellie die, Joel battles his way to the operating room, kills the lead surgeon, and carries the unconscious Ellie to the parking garage. He is confronted by Marlene, whom he shoots and kills to prevent the Fireflies from pursuing them. On the drive out of the city, when Ellie wakes up, Joel claims that the Fireflies had found many other immune people, but were unable to create a cure and that they have stopped trying. On the outskirts of Tommy's settlement, Ellie expresses her survivor guilt. At her insistence, Joel swears his story about the Fireflies is true."

        "content": "Naughty Dog began developing The Last of Us in 2009, following the release of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. For the first time in the company's history, Naughty Dog split into two teams; while one team developed Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception (2011), the other began work on The Last of Us. Game director Bruce Straley and creative director Neil Druckmann led the team responsible for developing The Last of Us. While at university, Druckmann had an idea to merge the gameplay of Ico (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968), with a lead character similar to John Hartigan from Sin City (1991\u20132000). The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to the lead character's heart condition, players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles. Druckmann later developed it when creating the story of The Last of Us. Druckmann views The Last of Us as a coming of age story, in which Ellie adapts to survival after spending time with Joel, as well as an exploration of how willing a father is to save his child. A major motif of the game is that \"life goes on\"; this is presented in a scene in which Joel and Ellie discover a herd of giraffes, which concept artist John Sweeney explained was designed to \"reignite [Ellie's] lust for life\", after her suffering following her encounter with David. The Infected, a core concept of the game, were inspired by a segment of the BBC nature documentary Planet Earth (2006), which featured the Cordyceps fungi. Though the fungi mainly infect insects, taking control of their motor functions and forcing them to help cultivate the fungus, the game explores the concept of the fungus evolving and infecting humans, and the direct results of an outbreak of this infection. The relationship between Joel and Ellie was the focus of the game; all other elements were developed around it. Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson were cast as Joel and Ellie, respectively, and provided voice and motion capture performances. Baker and Johnson contributed to the development of the characters; for example, Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness, and Johnson convinced Druckmann that Ellie should be stronger and more defensive. Following comparisons to actor Elliot Page, Ellie's appearance was redesigned to better reflect Johnson's personality and make her younger. The game's other characters also underwent changes. The character Tess was originally intended to be the main antagonist, but the team found it difficult to believe her motives. The sexuality of the character Bill was originally left vague in the script, but later altered to further reflect his homosexuality. The Last of Us features an original score composed primarily by Gustavo Santaolalla, along with compositions by Andrew Buresh, Anthony Caruso, and Jonathan Mayer. Known for his minimalist compositions, Santaolalla was contacted early in development. He used various instruments to compose the score, including some that he was unfamiliar with, giving a sense of danger and innocence. This minimalist approach was also taken with the game's sound and art design. The sound of the Infected was one of the first tasks during development; the team experimented with the sound in order to achieve the best work possible. To achieve the sound of the Clicker, they hired voice actress Misty Lee, who provided a sound that audio lead Phillip Kovats described as originating in the \"back of the throat\". The art department took various pieces of work as inspiration, such as Robert Polidori's photographs following Hurricane Katrina, which were used as a reference point when designing the flooded areas of Pittsburgh. The art department were forced to negotiate for things that they wished to include, due to the strong differing opinions of the team during development. Ultimately, the team settled on a balance between simplicity and detail; while Straley and Druckmann preferred the former, the art team preferred the latter. The game's opening credits were produced by Sony's San Diego Studio. The Last of Us game designer Ricky Cambier cited the video games Ico and Resident Evil 4 as influences on the game design. He said the emotional weight of the relationship needed to be balanced with the tension of the world's issues, stating that they \"wanted to take the character building and interaction\" of Ico and \"blend it with the tension and action of Resident Evil 4.\" The team created new engines to satisfy their needs for the game. The artificial intelligence was created to coordinate with players; the addition of Ellie as artificial intelligence was a major contributor to the engine. The lighting engine was also re-created to incorporate soft light, in which the sunlight seeps in through spaces and reflects off surfaces. The gameplay introduced difficulty to the team, as they felt that every mechanic required thorough analysis. The game's user interface design also underwent various iterations throughout development. The Last of Us was announced on December 10, 2011, at the Spike Video Game Awards, alongside its debut trailer. The announcement ignited widespread anticipation within the gaming industry, which journalists ascribed to Naughty Dog's reputation. The game missed its original projected release date of May 7, 2013, and was pushed to June 14, 2013 worldwide for further polishing. To promote pre-order sales, Naughty Dog collaborated with several retailers to provide special editions of the game with extra content. According to Jason Schreier of Bloomberg News, a PlayStation 5 remake of the game, codenamed \"T1X\", is in development, having started at Sony's Visual Arts Support Group studio but eventually moving under Naughty Dog's budget after some staff joined the project in 2020."

        "content": "The Last of Us received \"universal acclaim\", according to review aggregator Metacritic, based on 98 reviews. It is the fifth-highest-rated PlayStation 3 game on Metacritic. Reviewers praised the character development, story and subtext, visual and sound design, and depiction of female and LGBT characters. It is considered one of the most significant seventh-generation video games, and has been included among the greatest video games of all time. Colin Moriarty of IGN called The Last of Us \"a masterpiece\" and \"PlayStation 3's best exclusive\", and Edge considered it \"the most riveting, emotionally resonant story-driven epic\" of the console generation. Oli Welsh of Eurogamer wrote that it is \"a beacon of hope\" for the survival horror genre; Andy Kelly of Computer and Video Games declared it \"Naughty Dog's finest moment\". Kelly of Computer and Video Games found the story memorable, and IGNs Moriarty named it one of the game's standout features. PlayStation Official Magazine's David Meikleham wrote that the pacing contributed to the improvement of the story, stating that there is \"a real sense of time elapsed and journey traveled along every step of the way\", and Destructoids Jim Sterling lauded the game's suspenseful moments. Richard Mitchell of Joystiq found that the narrative improved the character relationships. The characters\u2014particularly the relationship between Joel and Ellie\u2014received acclaim. Matt Helgeson of Game Informer wrote that the relationship felt identifiable, naming it \"poignant\" and \"well drawn\". Eurogamers Welsh wrote that the characters were developed with \"real patience and skill\", appreciating their emotional value, and Joystiq Mitchell found the relationship \"genuine\" and emotional. PlayStation Official Magazines Meikleham named Joel and Ellie the best characters of any PlayStation 3 game, while IGNs Moriarty identified it as a highlight of the game. Kelly of Computer and Video Games named the characters \"richly painted\", feeling invested in their stories. Philip Kollar of Polygon felt that Ellie was believable, making it easier to develop a connection to her, and that the relationship between the characters was assisted by the game's optional conversations. The performances also received praise, with Edge and Eurogamers Welsh noting that the script improved as a result. Many reviewers found the game's combat a refreshing difference from other games. Game Informers Helgeson appreciated the vulnerability during fights, while Kelly of Computer and Video Games enjoyed the variety in approaching the combat. IGNs Moriarty felt that the crafting system assisted the combat, and that the latter contributed to the narrative's emotional value, adding that enemies feel \"human\". Joystiqs Mitchell reiterated similar comments, stating that the combat \"piles death upon death on Joel's hands\". Welsh of Eurogamer found the suspenseful and threatening encounters added positively to the gameplay. Tom Mc Shea of GameSpot wrote that the artificial intelligence negatively affected the combat, with enemies often ignoring players' companions. Polygons Kollar also felt that the combat was unfair, especially when fighting the Infected, and noted some inconsistencies in the game's artificial intelligence that \"shatters the atmosphere\" of the characters. The game's visual features were commended by many reviewers. The art design was lauded as \"outstanding\" by Computer and Video Games Kelly, and \"jaw-dropping\" by Eurogamers Welsh. In contrast, Mc Shea of GameSpot identified the visual representation of the post-apocalyptic world was \"mundane\", having been portrayed various times previously. The game's graphics have been frequently named by critics as the best for a PlayStation 3 game, with Helgeson of Game Informer naming them \"unmatched in console gaming\" and Moriarty of IGN stating that they contribute to the realism. Destructoids Sterling wrote that the game was visually impressive but that technical issues, such as some \"muddy and basic\" textures found early in the game, left a negative impact on the visuals. The world and environments of the game drew acclaim from many reviewers. Kelly of Computer and Video Games stated that the environments are \"large, detailed, and littered with secrets\", adding that The Last of Us \"masks\" its linearity successfully. Edge repeated similar remarks, writing that the level design serves the story appropriately. Helgeson of Game Informer wrote that the world \"effectively and gorgeously [conveys] the loneliness\" of the story. IGNs Moriarty appreciated the added design elements placed around the game world, such as the hidden notes and letters. The plausibility of the infection was commended by Scientific Americans Kyle Hill. Reviewers praised the use of sound in The Last of Us. Eurogamers Welsh felt that the sound design was significantly better than in other games, while Game Informers Helgeson dubbed it \"amazing\". Mc Shea of GameSpot stated that the audio added to the effect of the gameplay, particularly when hiding from enemies. Kelly of Computer and Video Games found that the environmental audio positively impacted gameplay, and that Gustavo Santaolalla's score was \"sparse and delicate\". Both Game Informers Helgeson and Destructoid Sterling called the score \"haunting\", with the latter finding that it complements the gameplay. The graphic depiction of violence in The Last of Us generated substantial commentary from critics. Engadget writer Ben Gilbert found the game's persistent focus on combat was \"a necessary evil to lead the game's fragile protagonist duo to safety\", as opposed to being used as a method to achieve objectives. Kotakus Kirk Hamilton wrote that the violence was \"heavy, consequential and necessary\", as opposed to gratuitous. USgamers Anthony John Agnello wrote that the game consistently reinforces the negativity associated with violence, intentionally making players feel uncomfortable while in violent combat. He stated that the deaths within the game were not unnecessary or unjustified, making the story more powerful. Kelly of Computer and Video Games stated that, despite the \"incredibly brutal\" combat, the violence never felt gratuitous. Eurogamers Welsh echoed similar remarks, stating that the violence is not \"desensitized or mindless\". Matt Helgeson of Game Informer observed that the game's violence leads to players questioning the morality of their choices. Joystiqs Mitchell wrote that the violence is \"designed to be uncomfortable\", stating that it contributes to Joel's character. Prior to the release of the game, Keith Stuart of The Guardian wrote that the acceptability of the violence would depend on its context within the game. Many critics discussed the game's depiction of female characters. Jason Killingsworth of Edge praised its lack of sexualized female characters, writing that it \"offers a refreshing antidote to the sexism and regressive gender attitudes of most blockbuster videogames\". Eurogamers Ellie Gibson praised Ellie as \"sometimes strong, sometimes vulnerable, but never a clich\u00e9\". She felt that Ellie is initially established as a \"damsel in distress\", but that this concept is subverted. GameSpots Carolyn Petit praised the female characters as morally conflicted and sympathetic, but wrote that gender in video games should be evaluated \"based on their actual merits, not in relation to other games\". Chris Suellentrop of The New York Times acknowledged that Ellie was a likable and \"sometimes powerful\" character, but argued that The Last of Us is \"actually the story of Joel\", stating that it's \"another video game by men, for men and about men\". The Last of Us was also praised for its depiction of LGBT characters. Sam Einhorn of GayGamer.net felt that the revelation of Bill's sexuality \"added to his character ... without really tokenizing him\". American organization GLAAD named Bill one of the \"most intriguing new LGBT characters of 2013\", calling him \"deeply flawed but wholly unique\". A kiss between two female characters in Left Behind was met with positive reactions."

It is the third-highest-rated PlayStation 4 game on Metacritic, behind Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2. The game's enhanced graphics received positive reactions. Colin Moriarty of IGN felt that the graphical fidelity of Remastered was an improvement over The Last of Us, despite the latter being \"the most beautiful game [he'd] seen on any console\". GamesRadar's David Houghton echoed this statement, calling the visuals \"jaw-dropping\". VideoGamer.com reiterated the graphical improvement over the original game, particularly praising the increased draw distance and improved lighting technology. Liam Martin of Digital Spy also felt that the lighting system improves the gameplay and makes the game \"feel even more dangerous\". Game Informers Tim Turi stated that the game is \"even more breathtaking\" than The Last of Us. Matt Swider of TechRadar appreciated the minor detail changes and the technical improvements. The Independents Jack Fleming felt that the original game's visual flaws were enhanced in Remastered, but greatly complimented the updated graphics regardless. Many reviewers considered the technical enhancements, such as the increased frame rate, a welcome advancement from the original game. Turi of Game Informer felt that the frame rate \"dramatically elevate[s]\" the game above the original. Jim Sterling of The Escapist complimented the upgraded frame rate, commenting that the original frame rate is a \"noticeably inferior experience\". IGNs Moriarty stated that, though the change was initially \"jarring\", he appreciated it through further gameplay. Tom Hoggins of The Daily Telegraph echoed these statements, feeling as though the increased frame rate heightened the intensity of the gameplay. Philip Kollar of Polygon appreciated the game's improved textures and loading times. The addition of Photo Mode was well received. TechRadars Swider named the mode as a standout feature, while IGNs Moriarty complimented the availability to capture \"gorgeous\" images using the feature. The adjustment of the controls received praise, with Moriarty of IGN particularly approving the DualShock 4's triggers. Swider of TechRadar felt that the additional controls result in a better functioning game, while Digital Spy's Martin felt that it improves the game's combat, commenting that it \"increase[s] this sense of immersion\". Reviewers also appreciated the inclusion of the DLC and the audio commentary. These features led The Escapists Sterling to dub Remastered as \"the definitive version of the game\"."

By January 2015, Druckmann had written the script's second draft, and performed a read-through with some actors. Very little work occurred following this, as Druckmann stated in April 2016 that the film had entered development hell. In November 2016, Raimi stated that the film was at a standstill after Sony had a disagreement with Druckmann. Druckmann stated in a 2021 interview that the film fell apart as there was too much studio focus on making big action set-pieces, a concept that he felt did not work well for the nature of The Last of Us which he felt was better approached as a smaller indie film. Actress Maisie Williams expressed enthusiasm in playing Ellie, and was in talks with both Druckmann and Raimi to take the role. In January 2020, images surfaced of an animated short film adaptation of The Last of Us by production agency Oddfellows. The 20-minute film was intended to \"serve as a strong bridge\" between the game and its sequel and would \"reinterpret each of the chapters of the game with a unique visual treatment\", but was canceled by Sony."

The episode discusses the antics surrounding the surrogacy of Cam   (Eric Stonestreet) and Mitch's (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) second child. There are problems surrounding the issue of which father would be the child's biological child, so Claire (Julie Bowen) offers them her egg. This would mean that both fathers share genetics with the child, but it would mean that Mitchell's child would be the child of his sister as well. Another plot line within the episode entails Manny (Rico Rodriguez) getting hurt while Jay (Ed O'Neill) was trying to convince him to play football because he thinks his son is too similar to his mother. Overall, the episode received positive reviews, but was not viewed by as many people compared to the previous episode.

The couple has recently had a son via a surrogate mother and that is the main reason they want to buy a new house. The deal is done and Phil and Claire (Julie Bowen) want to take out for dinner Cam and Mitch as a way to thank them. At the dinner, Cam feels depressed because the process of their attempt to adopt a second baby is taking too long and the solution of surrogacy does not sound good because one of them would be left out since only one could be the biological father. All four of them are drinking while they are discussing and Claire ends up offering her egg to them so they can have a half-Pritchett and half-Tucker baby. Everyone seems ecstatic with her offer until next morning when they realized what they agreed to. Mitch tells Cam that they can't accept Claire's offer because it will be weird to have his sister's kid. Phil also tells Claire that they can not do that and Claire agrees with him but none of the four knows how to tell each other that they changed their minds. Meanwhile, Jay (Ed O'Neill) thinks that Manny (Rico Rodriguez) spends too much time with his mother Gloria (Sof\u00eda Vergara) and he tries to make him do more \"guy\" things and activities, like playing football instead of going to the theater or collecting lucky pennies. He tells Gloria that his friend did not find tickets for a theater play Manny wanted to go so he can take him to play football. Manny is injured at the football practice because he stops to pick up a penny. Gloria blames Jay for Manny's injury, especially after she finds out that his friend did find tickets for the play and Jay cancelled them so Manny can go to the football practice. At the end of the episode, the whole family gathers at Jay and Gloria's house where Claire, Phil, Cam and Mitch try to tell each other about the surrogate issue. Haley (Sarah Hyland), Alex (Ariel Winter) and Luke (Nolan Gould) hear their parents talking about it and they believe that what their mother offered to do is great. Mitch and Cam hear them and believe that Claire and Phil already told them about it because they really want to help them. Mitch and Cam ask for Jay's opinion about it and Jay says that it is not right to do something like that. Soon, everyone starts saying their opinion and Mitch and Claire get under the table to discuss alone in peace about what they should do. They end up saying that they should not do it even though they love each other very much."

Christine N. Ziemba from Paste Magazine gave the episode an 8.5/10. \"This week\u2019s Modern Family focused on the issue of surrogate mothers vs. adoption for gay parents. Thankfully, the episode didn\u2019t fall into the trappings of A Very Special Blossom\u2026 or an after-school special. It dealt with the issues in a very adult manner: by downing lots of alcohol.

We\u2019d like to see more of that, please.\" Shayelizatrotter of The Comedy Critic gave an A+ to the episode saying that Modern Family made an \"impressive comeback\" after last week's \"forgettable episode\". \"Overall, a fantastic episode with a number of hilarious, quotable scenes!\" JeffEightyOne of Ape Donkey said that this was a \"solid rebound episode\". \"One of the things I think Modern Family does well is even though each episode has to find a way to establish various storylines pretty efficiently and then follow through with them, they still find a way to include plenty of good throwaway lines/moments. The first 5 minutes of \u201cAunt Mommy\u201d demonstrated this quite well.\""

Chidambaram, appearing for the peasant Madasami, wins a case filed by an agent of a British proprietor. Chidambaram's father, who appeared for the agent, sends his son to Thoothukudi lest the British proprietor should give him any trouble. Madasami who accompanies Chidambaram, looks after the latter's salt-pan. At Thoothukudi, Chidambaram meets Subramaniya Siva, a freedom fighter and works for the Swadeshi movement. Chidambaram receives a complaint from some of the local merchants that the British Shipping Company had refused to load their goods. Against great odds, Chidambaram starts the National Shipping Company with Indian Capital to free Indian trade from dependence on foreign liners. The company prospers despite attempts by the British Company to sabotage the ship of the Indian firm. Chidambaram incurs the displeasure of the Government by organising a strike for getting the grievances of the local coral mill workers redressed and by organising public celebrations to mark the release of Bipin Chandra Pal in contravention of a prohibitory order. Chidambaram, along with Siva, is invited to Tirunelveli by the District Collector, Winch. The collector directs them not to engage in political activity and also orders them out of the District. They defy the orders and are arrested. In the trial which ensues, Chidambaram is sentenced to 20 years life imprisonment and Siva to 10 years. Chidambaram's sentence is reduced to six years on appeal. The imprisonment of these two leaders sparks off mass unrest which is put down ruthlessly. Some time later, the new District Collector Ashe is shot dead by a patriotic Vanchinathan, who commits suicide before the police can reach him. The news of the unrelenting struggle outside gives much consolation to Chidambaram and Siva who are treated barbarously in the prison. Chidambaram emerges from the prison a broken man only to witness a series of disappointments\u00a0\u2013 Chidambaram's brother has become insane, Siva is a victim of leprosy contracted during his term in prison, people have forgotten him and his role in the Indian independence movement, the National Shipping Company is bought by its British rival and leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Subramania Bharati die one after another. Chidambaram devotes the last years of his life to the study of literature and dies still dreaming of the day when India would be free."

The film is based on the 1944 book of the same name by M. P. Sivagnanam, a biography of Chidambaram Pillai. During a time when the DMK was gaining political ground in Tamil Nadu, a time when there was competition between parties, and films were pitched against each other, the opposition unleashed a malicious propaganda that since Chidambaram belonged to the Indian National Congress, Kappalottiya Thamizhan was a film for the Congress. Certain people did not want the masses to be \"stirred\" by the nationalist spirit. Sivaji Ganesan was hesitant to do the role of Chidambaram as he doubted whether he could perform the role flawlessly, but later accepted and studied various material to understand Chidambaram. S. V. Subbaiah was cast as the poet Subramania Bharati alias Bharathiyar, taking inspiration from his role as Kavi Anandar from the play Kaviyin Kanavu (1945). V. Nagaiah who was then in \"dire straits\", was signed up for a significant role, that of Ulaganathan Pillai, as Panthulu wanted to give him a \"break in films\". According to film historian S. Theodore Baskaran, there is no evidence of any research undertaken for making the film. He stated that the film had no props, apart from the character's costumes and the female characters' ear-lobes, which were done to create a \"period effect\". Though then known for his theatrical-style acting, Ganesan tried acting naturally during the prison sequences and his character's trauma of disillusionment. While primarily in black and white, the film was partly coloured using Gevacolor, and the colour sequences were processed at the Film Centre, Mumbai."

About the film's initial failure, Ganesan felt that since the Congress did not understand artistic sensitivities, Kappalottiya Tamizhan, which was a film made for the Congress, was a box office failure. He also stated that he was not upset for losing money making the film to kindle the national spirit, but rather happy that he could harness the medium to remind people of the Indian freedom fighters of the bygone era.

At the 51st Primetime Emmy Awards, this episode won awards for Direction for Paris Barclay and Guest Actress for Debra Monk as well as a nominations in Writing for Steven Bochco, David Milch, Bill Clark and Nicholas Wootton. Barclay also won a Directors Guild of America Award. The episode also won an Eddie Award and a Banff Rockie Award as well as a Cinema Audio Society Award nomination. This was Smits' last regular appearance as Simone, although he returned for one scene in an episode during the twelfth season.  The episode highlights his rapid and mysterious physical demise, which has culminated in his need for a heart transplant. Many emotional portrayals are included to represent the feelings of loved ones, friends and colleagues when someone that they care about is suddenly in dire medical need. In another storyline, the episode simultaneously highlights the stress that can be caused when alcoholism afflicts a family through a critically acclaimed guest appearance by Debra Monk as the ex-wife of Sipowicz."

        "content": "The episode begins with a special five-minute extended \"Previously on NYPD Blue\" segment that retraces Simone's (Jimmy Smits) whole character history. The final portion of the prologue  presents Lt. Arthur Fancy's (James McDaniel) prior episode persuasion of a police widow to directly donate her husband's heart to give Simone a chance to live.  The regular portion of the episode begins after the completed heart transplant. The episode focuses on whether Simone's heart transplant was successful.  It starts ten days after the heart transplant with his anticipated hospital release.  Simone's  recovery is hampered by an internal chest infection, which leaves him weakened.  The doctors attempt diagnosis of the infection and weakness, which appear to be minor, with tests. Tensions run high in the department from almost the beginning of the episode. Greg Medavoy (Gordon Clapp) has a scene where his verbal aggression with a citizen complainant provides a respite and represents the frustration and helplessness of Simone's friends and colleagues.  James Martinez' (Nicholas Turturro) generally good manners are also tested. Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) displays deep emotions to his wife ADA Sylvia Costas (Sharon Lawrence). The doctors differ in their opinions of which treatment to use. One advises Simone and wife Diane Russell (Kim Delaney) to pursue surgery, while another advises natural progression. Sipowicz's ex-wife Katie (Debra Monk) catches him offguard by appearing at the station drunk and asking for his help. She is preparing a pro se defense against DWI charges, but when Sipowicz is about to respond with assistance, she slips away. The personal turmoil drags him away from his compassionate watch. When he is distracted, Simone's health deteriorates to the point where his demise seems imminent. Dr. Carreras suggests ending the suffering, while Dr. Swan disagrees, but Carreras believes his sentiment is masking office politics that govern how statistics are attributed to various departments. Russell is conflicted on which doctor to take advice from. Sipowicz manages his ex-wife's crisis by negotiating agreed Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. After Simone receives his last rites, his colleagues say their goodbyes, while Simone dreams aloud of his mentor Patsy Ferrara. In Simone's waking dream, Patsy acts as a medium, helping Simone transition out of life. In the end, with his wife Russell, having removed his wedding ring, by his side, Simone, shedding a final tear, fades away, and the screen fades to white (as opposed to black)."

        "content": "After one season on NYPD Blue, David Caruso decided to leave his role as Detective John Kelly and pursue a movie career when he was unable to secure a salary increase from $80,000 (US$ in  dollars) per episode to $100,000 (US$). At the time, Caruso had a pending Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series nomination for the 46th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1994. Meanwhile, ABC was enduring the odd combination of high ratings, high critical praise and largescale network affiliate boycotts of its breakthrough use of nudity and profanity on public television that forced it to offer discounted advertising rates in spite of its success. Smits, who had left his Emmy Award-winning role as Victor Sifuentes on L.A. Law in 1991,  was signed as a replacement on August 18, 1994. Caruso would continue in his role for the first four episodes of the second season, and Smits replaced him in a new role in episode 5 in November. Smits originally hoped to sign with the show for three years, while ABC sought a more standard five-year contract. In April 1998, toward the end of the fifth season, Smits told Liz Smith that he would only perform in a handful of episodes in the sixth season in order to smoothly transition his character's departure. Smits declined interviews and made a written statement, but show creator Steven Bochco noted that Smits had come to the decision several weeks before he announced it. Smits earned five consecutive Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series nominations as well as three nominations for Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Drama for the Simone role. Smits, who earned the Golden Globe Award at the 53rd Golden Globe Awards in 1996 for the role, stated that \"I accomplished what I sought to do - to prove I can act - and now it's time to seek another course.\" In mid-June 1998, rumors surfaced that Rick Schroder would replace Smits.  The following week, Schroder was officially announced as the replacement. By late September, the buildup the Smits' departure was set to commence with the first episode of season 6, on October 20. On October 7, ABC announced that Smits would be stabbed in the opening episode of the season. The week before the season premiere, Mark Tinker revealed that Smits would be written out in the fifth episode of the season and Schroder would enter in the subsequent episode. Bochco revealed that National Enquirer and other gossip tabloids had offered to pay for details about the storyline. The five-week story arc was scheduled so that the final three weeks were in the November sweeps with Schroder's debut marking the final week of the sweeps.  When the network decided to pre-empt the show on Election Night (November 3), the final episode was moved back to the second last night of sweeps. The first week stabbing was regarded as similar to the murder of Jonathan Levin. ABC sent the media the first two episodes prior to the season 6 premiere. In the first episode, Smits is both stabbed and inadvertently cut by his dentist. Based on the first two episodes, Dave Matheny and Neal Justin of the Star Tribune determined that Simone would endure a worsening mysterious illness. In the third episode of the arc, Smits was hospitalized and in need of a heart transplant. The fourth episode was a buildup to impending heart surgery as he struggles with cardiomyopathy."

Law, Smits had returned to the show for critically acclaimed guest appearances during sweeps episodes after leaving his regular role. Whether Smits' character would overlap with Schroder's character on screen was undetermined when Schroder was announced in June, but at the time Season 6 production was scheduled to commence on August 10, 1998. As of mid-July, Smits' departing episode was not scheduled to film until September. On the eve of the season 6 premiere, NYPD Blue executives assured the public that Smits' storyline would not be irreversible. However, this led to doubt among critics who did not feel it was possible to have a sensible storyline that retained the services of Kim Delaney in the role of Simone's wife Detective Diane Russell. A humorous piece in Newsweek described the general consensus as \"He's gonna die. He looks like he's dying...If he dies, it's easy to keep his wife (played by Kim Delaney) on the show.\" In addition, his castmates noted that their characters would grieve. However, some sources, such as National Public Radio's Noah Adams and Robert Siegel, read into the fact that \"Network publicity speaks of Simone's departure, not his demise...\""

He explained to his hometown newspaper, The Buffalo News, that the five-story arc was chosen because a surprise event would not have worked in this media age with the audience's expectation of the character's departure. According to Kim Delaney, during the filming of this episode the cast was repeatedly breaking down emotionally as if they were experiencing a personal death in the family. The 90-minute special extended into the Sports Night time slot that preceded NYPD Blue during the 1998\u201399 United States network television season.

Such scenes are as common as headache relief commercials. However, Smits' compassionate portrayal is as realistic as weekly TV drama gets.\" He described Russell (Delaney) as \"...superb Tuesday night, displaying both helpless agony and feisty determination.\" Although he praised her role as a wife, he noted that as a detective her dealings with her partner Det. Jill Kurkendall (Andrea Thompson) were clich\u00e9d. He noted that Greg Medavoy's  (Gordon Clapp) \"...frustration epitomizes the concern of the precinct crew as it monitors Bobby's Simone's battle for life.\" He noted that Sipowicz' (Franz) storyline with his first wife, Katie (Monk) \"...provides a needed diversion from the hospital room drama.\"Seattle Post-Intelligencer Levesque claimed the finale had its ups and downs. He describes the Sipowicz subplot as the only \"viable\" one in the episode, stating that Monk's performance had \"a frantic loneliness that almost brings the show back to its dark, gritty-streets realism\". He claims this performance is tempered by the dramatic, but unrealistic \"overwrought behavior\" of Simone's fretful colleagues. He summarized the episode as \"well written (by Nicholas Wootton) and generally well acted, with several characters having to experience a range of emotions\", but was most disappointed in Delaney's performance as Russell. The Chicago Sun-Times Rosenthal described the episode as \"wrenching\" and a \"powerful piece\". He says the focus of the episode is whether Simone's transplant took and that the episode downplayed policework, while highlighting the interpersonal. He noted that the performance made Simone an Emmy Award favorite.  He notes that a lot of emotions are displayed by Simone's colleagues and that the episode also has a meaningful secondary storyline in which Sipowicz shows volatility in the face of \"Simone's uncertain health and the reappearance of his alcoholic ex-wife\". Kevin Newman of ABC's Good Morning America described the finale as \"very touching\" and noted that Smits, himself, claimed to have warned his own mother not to watch because it would be \"too emotional\".

And rather than developing a crime investigation subplot, the episode wisely keeps its focus on the medical themes of recent weeks, as Kim Delaney's Diane continues to cope with a rather cold medical establishment. Delaney is quite affecting, as she moves expertly among profound emotions that extend well beyond concern and fear. The episode also brings back Andy's first wife, Katie, who has become a prisoner of grief for their late son. Andy must help her out, even though he and the other cops at the 15th precinct are preoccupied with Bobby, who begins the episode with a new heart in place. But the episode belongs to Smits, who ends the Smits era of \"NYPD Blue\" with grace and power.}}</ref>The Buffalo News describes the finale as a \"heart-pounding resolution\", noting that the final moment between Sipowicz and Simone was \"also emotional despite its simplicity\".

Monica Collins of the Boston Herald'' said the episode \"lives up to the hype\" with \"high melodrama\" that offset \"graceful, gutsy storytelling\".

Sipowicz endured heartfelt suffering due to the friendship that had grown beyond his imagination, while his ex-wife needed his emotional support and connections regarding her legal situation.

        "content": "The origins of The Longest Daycare came about when The Simpsons executive producer James L. Brooks proposed the idea of making a short film and releasing it in cinemas in front of a feature film\u2014similar to how animation film studio Pixar creates shorts to play before their feature films. He wanted the short to be a fun gift for the fans of The Simpsons, and according to the series' showrunner Al Jean, \"We [the staff] just wanted to do this as a way of saying, 'We appreciate how much people have stayed with the show and watched it for 25 years.'\" Brooks picked David Silverman, long-time veteran of the series and director of The Simpsons Movie (2007) to oversee the film. Silverman gave credit to Richard Sakai for the idea to produce the film in stereoscopic 3-D. He considered the reasoning for employing 3-D \"hard to describe,\" noting that was largely an experiment and its genesis was born out of \"having fun.\" The group first gathered in March 2011\u2014consisting of Brooks, Silverman, Al Jean, David Mirkin, writers Joel Cohen and Michael Price, and Simpsons creator Matt Groening via phone\u2014to pitch ideas for a short. Early on, it was decided to keep it entirely silent and employ Maggie as the lead character, and the setting of a daycare was decided upon. Jean wrote the treatment for the film, and Silverman completed an animatic of early story reels in June 2011. By the following February, the team regrouped to structure the story and formulate more ideas. With the help of Brad Ableson, Erick Tran and Ben Lane, the storyboards and animatic for the short were approved and the film entered production. Silverman himself animated two shots present in the final film. Silverman and his crew began animation work on the short in March 2012, completing in May after just under ten weeks of production. He considered his crew \"very experienced\", noting that he worked with stereographer Eric Kurland for the 3-D shots. It was animated with The Simpsons usual production pipeline, which involved sending shots to AKOM in South Korea, but with an amplified focus on the 3-D.  The team would attempt to complete ten scenes to send to AKOM per week, which would be returned in a cleaned-up form after two weeks. Shots were then composited together at Film Roman out of necessity as the backgrounds relied on the 3-D. Most stereo elements for 3-D were picked out after shots were cleaned up, while others were manipulated in post-production with After Effects. The short was more costly than the average episode of the television show."

The Longest Daycare has been praised for being both humorous and emotional. Puig and Biancolli described the short as \"hilarious\". Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic stated that the film is \"terrific\u2014sweet, sad, funny, surprising,\" and Kristian Lin of Fort Worth Weekly said it is \"clever\" and \"surprisingly moving\".  Writing for Pioneer Press, Chris Hewitt noted that Maggie's interaction with Gerald \"is hilarious and, ultimately, poignant in an animated film that covers more territory, all without dialogue, than most full-length movies.\" He went on to call the short a \"triumph of storytelling, pacing and big-hearted humor.\" A. O. Scott of The New York Times called the short a \"charming 3-D cartoon\" that is \"witty and touching and marvelously concise\". He added that it \"cleverly blends the bright-colored flatness of the television show with the gimmickry of 3-D. It also upholds (more than the TV series itself) one of the golden rules of animation: no talking.\" Tim Martain of The Mercury has also described the short as \"touching\". The Boston Globes Tom Russo thought the short was \"a welcome throwback to the days when The Simpsons had more sentiment at its core, and wasn\u2019t so much about the latest batch of newbie Ivy League writers taking their cues from Family Guy.\" In a joint review of the episode \"Hardly Kirk-ing\", Teresa Lopez of TV fanatic said \"The Longest Daycare was a beautiful piece of animation showcasing a tender story of hope in an otherwise bleak environment. I feel like the only time The Simpsons can really exercise some creativity and depth is in these shorts and during the show's opening sequence.\""

Nude per l'assassino has been described as following \"the giallo formula almost to the letter\", demonstrating that \"the giallo conventions established by Bava and Argento and elaborated upon by a number of directors in the early 1970s had become well codified\" by the time the film was produced. The film has also been cited as being \"the perfect bridge to the American slasher film\", with its emphasis on \"violence and sex\" and a plot \"dumbed down to the barest minimum\"."

Martyn Auty of the Monthly Film Bulletin, stated that \"For all its clich\u00e9d direction (voyeuristic threateningly subjective camerawork) and perfunctory sexual diversions, this routine sex-ploiter is at least tolerably shot and unfussily plotted.\" Writing for AllMovie, Jason Buchanan rated the film two stars out of five, calling it \"unabashedly sadistic\". Budd Wilkins, writing for Slant magazine, rated the film three stars out of five, calling it \"one of the more sordid examples\" of the giallo genre. Wilkins noted that the film's violence \"isn't necessarily stronger than in contemporary giallo films like Argento's Deep Red\", but that it is \"more resolutely tied to aberrant sexuality than almost anywhere else in the genre\". Wilkins also compared the film's central premise\u2014that of revenge for a failed abortion\u2014to that of Massimo Dallamano's 1972 film What Have You Done to Solange?. DVD Talk's Adam Tyner also gave the film two stars out of five, summarising it as \"not much of a movie\". Tyner noted that Nude per l'assassino \"doesn't set out to be revered as an artistic triumph\", and described it as \"worth at least a rental\" for fans of the genre. Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray compared the film to Sergio Martino's 1972 film Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key (Il tuo vizio \u00e8 una stanza chiusa e solo io ne ho la chiave), noting that \"both take place among the idle European aristocracy, with vapid models, rugged motocross drivers, bigoted executives, and debauched artists wandering through a world of soft fabrics and bloody, gashed skin\". Bloody Disgusting's Mike Pereira rated Nude per l'assassino 0.5 out of 5, writing that it \"reeks of amateur hour\". Pereira felt that the film featured \"dead-on-arrival pacing\" and \"terrible filmmaking and acting A staff review for the Italian magazine Nocturno rated the film four out of five, describing it as \"one of the most daring\" giallo films of the 1970s. Previewing the film's Blu-ray release, IGN's David McCutcheon described Nude per l'assassino as an \"infamous shocker that packs more grisly violence and sexual depravity into each frame than just about any other film\"."

But I don't fly.\" When not broadly riffing about love, commitment, and Jay-Z and Kim Kardashian, Rafael heals everyone around him (all of them dull types, including the angry goth teen and misbehaving young son) with advice like \"When you learn to love someone without condition, you will be loved in return\"\u2014nauseating platitudes that turn the film into a comedy of corny homilies.\""

        "content": "The Grand Budapest Hotel is a 2014 comedy-drama film written and directed by Wes Anderson. Ralph Fiennes leads a seventeen-actor ensemble cast as Monsieur Gustave H., famed concierge of a twentieth-century mountainside resort in the fictional country of Zubrowka. When Gustave is framed for the murder of a wealthy dowager (Tilda Swinton), he and his recently befriended prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Zero (Tony Revolori) embark on a quest for fortune and a priceless Renaissance painting amidst the backdrop of an encroaching fascist regime. Anderson's American Empirical Pictures produced the film in association with Studio Babelsberg, Fox Searchlight Pictures, and Indian Paintbrush's Scott Rudin and Steven Rales. Fox Searchlight supervised the commercial distribution, and The Grand Budapest Hotel funding was sourced through Indian Paintbrush and German government-funded tax rebates. Anderson and longtime collaborator Hugo Guinness conceived The Grand Budapest Hotel as a fragmented tale following a character inspired by a common friend. They initially struggled in their brainstorming, but the experience touring Europe and researching the literature of Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig shaped their vision for the film. The Grand Budapest Hotel draws visually from Europe-set mid-century Hollywood films and the Library of Congress's photochrom print collection of alpine resorts. Principal photography took place in eastern Germany from January to March 2013. French composer Alexandre Desplat composed the symphonic, Russian folk-inspired score, which expanded on his early work with Anderson. The film explores themes of fascism, nostalgia, friendship, and loyalty, and further studies emphasize the function of color as an important storytelling device. The Grand Budapest Hotel premiered in competition at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival on February 6, 2014. The French theatrical release on February 26 preceded the film's global rollout, followed by releases in Germany, North America, and the United Kingdom on March 6\u20137. The Grand Budapest Hotel received widespread acclaim for its craftsmanship, acting, and comedy; occasional criticism centered on the film's approach to the subject matter, fragmented storytelling, and characterization. It earned US$172.9\u00a0million in box office revenue worldwide, Anderson's highest grossing feature to date. The film led the 87th Academy Awards season with nine nominations (winning four), and earned several other accolades, chiefly for writing and technical achievement."

The book, written in 1985, recounts his 1968 vacation at the once-grand, then-drab hotel. There, he meets its owner, Zero Moustafa, who at dinner tells his rags to riches story. In 1932, Zero is the newly hired lobby boy at the prestigious Grand Budapest Hotel. Monsieur Gustave H., the hotel's fastidious concierge, seduces old, wealthy clients, including the 84-year-old dowager Madame D., with whom he has had a nearly two-decade affair. Madame D mysteriously dies a month after her last hotel visit. Gustave and Zero visit Madame's Schloss Lutz estate, where they encounter surviving relatives for the reading of her will by her attorney Deputy Vilmos Kovacs. Kovacs announces a recent codicil to the will which bequeaths Boy with Apple, a priceless Renaissance painting, to Gustave. Madame's son, Dmitri, is outraged and demands Gustave's arrest. Gustave and Zero leave, absconding with the painting for safekeeping. Gustave is later arrested by Inspector Henckels under the suspicion of Madame\u2019s murder. He befriends a gang during his imprisonment and the men plot their escape: Gustave has Zero place digging tools inside pastries made by Agatha, an apprentice baker at Mendl's and Zero's fianc\u00e9e. Gustave and the others dig their way out and disperse. When Zero and Gustave are reunited, they set out to prove Gustave's innocence with the assistance of a fraternity of concierges: the Society of the Crossed Keys. They learn that Madame D had a missing second will which would only take effect should she be murdered. Dmitri's hired assassin J. G. Jopling trails their whereabouts, murdering Kovacs, Madame D.'s butler Serge X, and Serge X's sister in his pursuit to kill Gustave. Following a chase, Zero pushes Jopling off a cliff to save Gustave, and the two men continue their escape from swarming Zubrowkan troops led by Henckels. Gustave, Zero, and Agatha arrive back at the Grand Budapest to find it converted into a military headquarters. Agatha sneaks in to retrieve Boy with Apple to sell, but is spotted with the painting by Dmitri. Gustave and Zero rush to save Agatha from harm as she flees from Dmitri. He shoots at them, initiating a confusing shootout with Zubrowkan troops; Henckels stops the fight. Agatha's attempt to escape leaves her and Zero hanging from a balcony before safely falling into a van of pastries. Madame's second will, making Gustave the beneficiary of her fortune, is found attached to the back of Boy with Apple; he succeeds her as owner of the Grand Budapest Hotel, and becomes one of the wealthiest Zubrowkans. He travels by train with the now-wed Zero and Agatha to celebrate, before encountering hostile soldiers that destroy Zero's refugee documents. Gustave tries to fend off the soldiers but is shot dead. Zero inherits his fortune and maintains the Grand Budapest in memory of Agatha, who died of flu with their infant son."

        "content": "Drafting of The Grand Budapest Hotel story began in 2006, when Wes Anderson produced an 18-page script with longtime collaborator Hugo Guinness. They imagined a fragmented tale of a character inspired by a mutual friend, based in modern France and the United Kingdom. Though their prototype led to a roughly 12-minute-long cut, the Anderson\u2013Guinness collaboration stalled when the two men were unable to coalesce a uniform sequence of events to advance their story. By this time, Anderson had begun researching the work of Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig, with which he was vaguely familiar. He became fascinated with Zweig, gravitating to Beware of Pity (1939), The World of Yesterday (1942), and The Post Office Girl (1982) for their fatalist mythos and Zweig's portrait of early twentieth-century Vienna. Anderson also referenced period images and urbane Europe-set mid-century Hollywood comedies. He ultimately pursued a historical pastiche with an alternate timeline, disillusioned with popular media's romanticism of pre-World War II European history. Once The Grand Budapest Hotel took definite form, Anderson resumed the scriptwriting, finishing the screenplay in six weeks. The producers tapped Jay Clarke to supervise production of the film's animatics, with voiceovers by Anderson. Anderson's sightseeing in Europe was another source of inspiration for The Grand Budapest Hotel visual motifs. The writer-director visited Vienna, Munich, and other major cities before the project's conception, but most location scouting began after the Cannes premiere of his coming-of-age drama Moonrise Kingdom (2012). He and the producers toured Budapest, small Italian spa towns, and the Czech resort Karlovy Vary before a final stop in Germany, consulting hotel staff to develop an accurate idea of a real-life concierge's work."

Norton and Murray immediately signed when sent the script. The Grand Budapest Hotel ensemble comprised mostly bit cameos. Because of the limitations of such roles, Brody said that the most significant challenge was balancing the film's comedy with the otherwise solemn subject matter. All were the filmmakers' first casting choices save for Swinton, whom they pursued for Madame D. when Angela Lansbury dropped out as a result of a prior commitment to a Driving Miss Daisy theater production. Once hired, actors were encouraged to study the source material to prepare. Dafoe and Fiennes in particular found the animatics helpful in conceptualizing The Grand Budapest Hotel from Anderson's perspective, though Fiennes did not refer to them too often because he wanted his performance to be spontaneous. Anderson desired an English actor to play Gustave, and Fiennes was an actor he sought to work with for several years. Fiennes, surprised by the offer, was eager to depart from his famously villainous roles and found Gustave's panache compelling. Fiennes said he was initially unsure how to approach his character because the extent of Anderson's oversight meant actors could not improvise on set, constraining his usually instinctive performing style. The direction of Gustave's persona then became another question of tone, whether the portrayal be hyper-camp or understated. Fiennes drew on several sources to shape his character's persona, among them his triple role as Hungarian-Jewish men escaping fascist persecution in the Istv\u00e1n Szab\u00f3-directed drama Sunshine (1999), his brief stint as a young porter at Brown's Hotel in London, and the experience reading The World of Yesterday. Johnny Depp was reported as an early candidate in the press, claims which Anderson denied, despite later reports that scheduling conflicts had halted negotiations. Casting director Douglas Aibel was responsible for hiring a suitable actor to play young Zero. Aibel's months-long search for prospective actors proved troublesome as he was unable to fulfill the specifications for an unknown teenage actor of Arabic descent. \"We were just trying to leave no stone unturned in the process.\" Filmmakers held auditions in Egypt, Lebanon, Israel, France, England, and the United States before revising the role's ethnic criterion. Eventually the filmmakers narrowed their search to Tony Revolori and his older brother Mario, novices of Guatemalan descent, and Tony landed the part after one taped audition. He and Anderson rehearsed together for over four months before the start of filming to build a rapport. Abraham spent about a week on set filming his scenes as the elderly Zero. Saoirse Ronan joined The Grand Budapest Hotel in November 2012. Though a longtime Anderson fan, Ronan feared the deadpan, theatrical acting style characteristic of Anderson-directed films would be too difficult to master. She was reassured by the writer-director's conviction, \"He guides everyone extremely well. He is very secure in his vision and he is very comfortable with everything he does. He knows it is going to work.\" The decision to play Agatha with Ronan's native Irish accent was Anderson's idea, after experimenting with German, English, and American accents; they felt an Irish accent projected a warm, feisty spirit into Agatha."

        "content": "The project was director of photography Robert Yeoman's eighth film with Anderson. Yeoman participated in an early scouting session with Anderson, recording footage with stand-in film crew to assess how certain scenes would unfold. Yeoman drew on Vittorio Storaro's dramatic lighting techniques in the romantic musical One From the Heart (1982). Filmmakers shot The Grand Budapest Hotel in ten weeks, from January to March 2013 in eastern Germany, where it qualified for a tax rebate financed by the German government's Federal Film Fund and Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg. They also found Germany attractive because the production base was geographically confined, facilitating efficient logistics, but the frigid weather and reduced daylight of early winter disrupted the shooting schedule, compounded by the slow film stock used for the camerawork. To rectify the issue, the producers used artificial lighting, accelerated the daily work schedule, and filmed night scenes at dusk. Principal photography took place at the Babelsberg Studio in suburban Berlin and in G\u00f6rlitz, a mid-sized border town on the Lusatian Neisse on Germany's eastern frontier. The filmmakers staged their largest interior sets at the vacant twentieth-century G\u00f6rlitzer Warenhaus, whose atrium doubled for the Grand Budapest Hotel lobby. The top two floors housed production offices and storage space for cameras and wardrobe. Anderson at one point considered buying the Warenhaus to save it from demolition. He and the producers eyed vacant buildings because they could exercise full artistic control, and scouting active hotels that often enforce heavy shooting restrictions would call into question The Grand Budapest Hotel integrity. Exterior shots of the eighteenth-century estate Hainewalde Manor and interior shots of Schloss Waldenburg stood in for the Schloss Lutz estate. Elsewhere in Saxony, production moved to Zwickau\u2014shooting at the Osterstein Castle\u2014and the state capital Dresden, where scenes were filmed at the Zwinger and the Pfunds Molkerei creamery."

        "content": "Yeoman shot The Grand Budapest Hotel on 35\u00a0mm film using Kodak Vision3 200T 5213 film stock from a single Arricam Studio camera provided by Arri's Berlin office. His approach entailed the use of a Chapman-Leonard Hybrid III camera dolly for tracking shots and a geared head to achieve most of the film's rapid whip pans. For whip pans greater than 90 degrees, the filmmakers installed a fluid head from Mitchell Camera Corporation's OConnor Ultimate product line for greater fidelity. Anderson requested Yeoman and project key grip Sanjay Sami focus on new methods for shooting the scenes. Thus they used the Mad About Technology Towercam Twin Peek, a telescoping camera platform, to traverse between floors, sometimes in lieu of a camera crane. For example, when a lantern drops to the basement from a hole in the cell floor in the Checkpoint Nineteen jailbreak scene, the filmmakers suspended the towercam upside-down, a setup which allowed the camera to descend to the ground. The Grand Budapest Hotel uses three aspect ratios as framing devices which streamline the film's story, evoking the aesthetic of the corresponding periods. The multifarious structure of The Grand Budapest Hotel emerged from Anderson's desire to shoot in 1.37:1 format, also known as Academy ratio. Production used Academy ratio for scenes set in 1932, which, according to Yeoman, provided the filmmakers with greater-than-routine headroom. He and the producers referred to the work of Ernst Lubitsch and other directors of the period to acclimate to the compositions produced from said format. Filmmakers formatted modern scenes in standard 1.85:1 ratio, and the 1968 scenes were captured in widescreen 2.40:1 ratio with Technovision Cooke anamorphic lenses. These lenses produced a certain texture, one that lacked the sharpness of Panavision's Primo anamorphic lenses. Yeoman lit interior shots with tungsten incandescent fixtures and DMX-dimmer-controlled lighting. The crew made the Warenhaus ceiling from stretched muslin rigged with twenty 4K HMI lamps, an arrangement wherein the reflected light penetrated the skylight, accentuating the set's daylighting. Yeoman preferred the lighting choice because the warm tungsten fixtures contrasted with the coolish daylight. When shooting deliberately less inviting hotel sets, such as Zero and Gustave's small bedrooms and the Grand Budapest's servants' quarters, the filmmakers combined fluorescent lighting, paper lanterns, and bare incandescent lights for historical accuracy. The Stuttgart-based LUXX Studios and Look Effects' German branch (also in Stuttgart) managed most of The Grand Budapest Hotel visual effects, under the supervision of Gabriel Sanchez. Their work for the film comprised 300 shots, created by a small cadre of specialized artists. The development of the film's effects was swift, but at times difficult. Sanchez did not work on set with Anderson as Look Effects opened their Stuttgart headquarters after The Grand Budapest Hotel filming wrapped, and therefore was only able to reference his prior experience with the director. The California-based artist also became homesick working his first international assignment. Only four artists from the newly assembled team had experience working on a multi-million dollar studio set. Creation of the effects was daunting because of their technical demands. The filmmakers camouflaged some of the stop-motion and matte effects in the forest-set chase scene to convey the desired intensity, and enhancing the snowscape with particle effects posed another challenge. Sanchez cites the observatory and hotel shots as work that best demonstrate his special effects team's ingenuity. To achieve the aging brutalist design of the 1968 Grand Budapest, they generated computer models supplemented with detailed lighting, matte effects and shadowy expanses. The crew used a similar technique in developing digital shots of the observatory; unlike the hotel, the observatory's base miniature was presented in pieces. They rendered the observatory with 20 different elements, data furthermore enhanced at Anderson's request. It took about one hour per shot to complete the final digital rendering."

        "content": "Adam Stockhausen\u2014another Anderson associate\u2014was responsible for The Grand Budapest Hotel production design. He and Anderson collaborated previously on The Darjeeling Limited (2007) and Moonrise Kingdom. Stockhausen researched the Library of Congress's photochrom print collection of alpine resorts to source ideas for the film's visual palette. These images showcased little of recognizable Europe, instead cataloging obscure historical landmarks unknown to the general public. The resulting stylistic choice is a warm, bright visual palette pronounced by soft pastel tonalities. Some of The Grand Budapest Hotel interior sets contrast this look in interior shots, primarily Schloss Lutz and the Checkpoint Nineteen prison: the imposing hardwoods, intense greens and golds of the Schloss Lutz evoke oppressive wealth, and the derelict Checkpoint Nineteen decays in a cool bluish-gray tint. The filmmakers relied on matte paintings and miniature effect techniques to play on perspective for elaborate scenes, creating the illusion of size and grandeur. Under the leadership of Simon Weisse, scale models of structures were constructed by a Berlin-based propmaking team at Studio Babelsberg in tandem with the G\u00f6rlitz shoot. Weisse joined The Grand Budapest Hotel design staff after coming to the attention of production manager Miki Emmrich, with whom he worked on Cloud Atlas (2012). Anderson liked the novelty of miniatures, having used them in The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004) and more extensively in Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009). Weisse and his propmakers built three major miniature models: the -scale forest set, the -scale observatory, and the -scale Grand Budapest Hotel set, based on art director Carl Sprague's conceptual renderings. The Grand Budapest Hotel set comprised the hotel building atop a wooded ledge with a funicular, bound by a Friedrichian landscape painting superimposed with green-screen technology. Designers sculpted the 3-meter-high (9.8\u00a0ft) hotel with silicone resin molds and etched brass embellishment. Photos of the Warenhaus set were then glued in boxes installed to each window to convey the illusion of light. The funicular's 35-degree slope required a separate, lateral model. Timber, soldered brass, fine powdered sugar, and styrofoam were used to construct the observatory set, and polyester fiberfill was the forest model's snow. The creation of Boy with Apple was a four-month-long process by English painter Michael Taylor, who was inspired by Renaissance portraiture. Taylor had been approached by one of the producers before receiving the script and source material, and the film's artistic direction piqued his interest. The painter originally worked alone before deferring to Anderson for input when certain aspects of the painting did not match the writer-director's vision. Taylor found the initial process difficult, struggling to be true to Boy with Apple eclectic sources. He said that while he had been unfamiliar with Anderson's work, that unfamiliarity enabled him to imbue the painting with a unique identity. The producers' casting choice for Boy with Apple subject was contingent on the character description of a blond-haired boy with the slender, athletic frame of a ballet dancer. They signed Ed Munro, an actor with a theater background, the day after his audition. The filmmakers staged the painting sessions at a Jacobean boarding school, then empty for summer holiday, near Taylor's home in Dorset. Filmmakers dressed Munro in about 50 ornate costumes with velvet cloaks, codpieces and furs, photographed each one, and submitted them to Anderson for approval. Munro, who maintained the same posture and facial expression for several hours, found the costuming uncomfortable. Ann Atkins was The Grand Budapest Hotel lead graphic designer. She devised Zubrowkan objects\u2014newspapers, banknotes, police reports and passports\u2014from reference material gathered from the location scouting. Atkins was a novice in film but had valuable expertise in advertising design to reference, producing 20 sketches of a single artifact per day when the on-set shooting peaked. She used an antique typewriter for the mock documents with a dip pen for the embellished handwriting. Among her early tasks was the creation of weathered, worn props for fidelity to the film's timeline. To achieve the appearance of prolonged exposure to air, Atkins blow dried paper dipped in tea. She said, \"The beautiful thing about period filmmaking is that you\u2019re creating graphic design for a time before graphic designers existed, per se. It was really the craftsmen who were the designers: the blacksmith designed the lettering in the cast iron gates; the glazier sculpted the lettering in the stained glass; the sign-painter drew the lettering for the shopfronts; the printer chose the type blocks for the stationery.\" Pastries are an important motif in The Grand Budapest Hotel story. The signature courtesan au chocolat from Mendl's mirrors the French dessert religieuse, a choux-based pastry with a mocha (or chocolate) glaze and vanilla custard filling. A G\u00f6rlitz pastry chef crafted the courtesan before working with Anderson on the final design."

        "content": "Veteran costume designer Milena Canonero endeavored to capture the essence of the film's characters. Canonero researched 1930s uniform design and period artwork by photographers George Hurrell and Man Ray and painters Kees van Dongen, Gustav Klimt, George Grosz and Tamara de Lempicka. Canonero was also influenced by non-period literature and art. Specialized artists then realized her designs in Photoshop, allowing them to work closely to the actors' likenesses. The filmmakers assembled most of the basic costumes in their G\u00f6rlitz workshop, others from the Berlin-based Theaterkunst, and the uniforms came from a Polish workshop. They rented vintagewear for extras in crowd shots. Canonero used dense mauve and deep-purple AW Hainsworth facecloth for the Grand Budapest uniforms instead of the more subdued colors typical of hospitality uniforms. She researched diverse ideas for the gray-and-black military uniforms, in accordance with script specifications that they not be green or too historically identifiable. Anderson did most of the insignia, occasionally approving designs from Canonero's workshop in Rome. The filmmakers gave the characters distinct looks. They distinguished men with facial hair to complement their sharp style. Gustave's wardrobe was intended to evoke \"a sense of perfection and control\" even in his collapsing livelihood. Anderson and Canonero visualized Agatha with a Mexico-shaped facial birthmark and a wheat blade in her hair, costumed to reflect her working-class stature and the brightness of her pastries. Madame was dressed in a silk velvet coat-and-gown-ensemble with Klimtesque handprint patterns and mink trim by Fendi, from a previous professional relationship with Anderson and Canonero. Fendi developed the gray astrakhan fur overcoat for Norton's Albert, and loaned other furs to assist the needs of the shoot. To age Swinton, makeup artist Mark Coulier applied soft silicone rubber prosthetics encapsulated in dissolvable plastic molding on her face. Dafoe's Jopling wore a Prada leather coat inspired by outerwear for military dispatch riders, adorned with custom silver knuckle pieces from jeweler Waris Ahluwalia (a close friend of Anderson's). Canonero modified the coat with fine red-wool stitching and a weapons compartment inside the front lapel."

The instrument gave Anderson and music supervisor Randall Poster a chance to immerse themselves in an unfamiliar genre, and they spent about six months consulting experts to hone their vision. Its score's classical roots make The Grand Budapest Hotel unique among Anderson-directed projects, forgoing the writer-director's usual practice of employing a selection of contemporary pop music. Desplat felt his exposure to Anderson's idiosyncrasies was integral to articulating an Eastern European musical approach for the film's score. His direction expanded on some of the sounds and instrumentation of Fantastic Mr. Fox and Moonrise Kingdom. As well, the scope of Desplat's responsibilities entailed differentiating The Grand Budapest Hotel sprawling cast of characters with distinctive melodic themes and motifs. ABKCO Records released the 32-track score digitally on March 4, 2014. It featured sampled recordings and contributions from orchestras such as the Osipov State Russian Folk Orchestra and a 50-person ensemble of French and Russian balalaika players."

        "title": "The Grand Budapest Hotel_Nostalgia and fascism",
        "content": "Nostalgia is a major theme in Anderson's repertoire. The Grand Budapest Hotel universe is envisioned with nostalgic yearning, where characters perpetuate the \"illusion of a time where they don't belong\", the consequence of not so much the recapture of a vanished era than a romanticizing of the past. One theory among critics suggests \"profound\" subtext of the science of human memory within the film's nonlinear narrative structure, whereas others saw The Grand Budapest Hotel as an introspection of Anderson's sensibilities both as a writer and as a director. According to the academic Donna Kornhaber, The Grand Budapest Hotel reinforces the increasingly dark subtext of collectivism defining late period Anderson films. The Grand Budapest Hotel does not directly refer to historical events, rather oblique references contextualize the real time history. The most deliberate of these references allude specifically to Nazism. In perhaps the film's most dramatic display of corrupt power, the Zubrowkan military invasion of the Grand Budapest, and the fascist emblems of the hotel lobby's newly adorned tapestry, mirror scenes from Leni Riefenstahl's propaganda film Triumph of the Will (1935). Gustave's black-and-white stripes evoke the uniforms of the concentration camp prisoners, and his steadfast commitment to his job becomes an act of defiance that threatens to jeopardize his life. The Atlantic Norman L. Eisen, who is among the people listed in \"Special Thanks\" at the end of the film, called The Grand Budapest Hotel a cautionary tale of the consequences of the Holocaust, a story that examines Nazi motivations while traversing postwar European history through comedy. He contends that certain main characters symbolize both the oppressed\u2014the openly bisexual Gustave represents the LGBT community, the refugee Zero represents nonwhite immigrants, and Kovacs represents ethnic Jews\u2014and the oppressor in Dmitri, overseer of a fascist, SS-like organization. Film critic Daniel Garrett argues Gustave defies fascist notions of human perfection because he embraces the flaws of his peers, despite his own expertise: \"Gustave is not surprised by feelings of anxiety or desire, or contemptuous of a scarred or crippled body; and he shares his values with his staff, with Zero. Gustave sees the heart and the effort, the spirit, despite his regard for excellence, ritual, and style.\""

        "title": "The Grand Budapest Hotel_Friendship and loyalty",
        "content": "Another principal topic of discussion among critics has been The Grand Budapest Hotel exploration of friendship and loyalty. Indeed, Zero appears to be Gustave's only true friend, and his unwavering devotion (at first, a mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship) establishes the film's strongest bond. Gustave is underwhelmed by Zero but is increasingly empathetic to his newly hired mentee's plight in their subsequent exploits, united by their shared enthusiasm for the hotel\u2014so much that he defends Zero against police thuggery and rewards his loyalty with his inheritance. Zero's less-central romance with Agatha is as constant a presence as his friendship with Gustave; he continues operating the hotel in his dead lover's memory, despite the slain Gustave representing the Grand Budapest's spirit. The subject matter's emphasis of love, friendship, and the intertwining tales of nobility, dignity, and self-control, The New Yorker Richard Brody argues, forms the \"very soul of a moral politics that transcends accidents of circumstance and particular historical incidents\". Kornhaber contends the focus on the dynamic of a mismatched pairing forms the crux of The Grand Budapest Hotel central theme. The unusual circumstance of the Gustave\u2013Zero friendship seems to reflect an attachment to \"an idea of historical and cultural belonging that they find ultimately to be best expressed through one another\", and by proxy, the two men discover a fundamental kinship through their shared esteem of the Grand Budapest."

The composition fades as the timeline forebodes impending war, sometimes in complete black-and-white in scenes exploring Zero's memory of wartime, underscoring the gradual tonal shift. Subdued beiges, orange, and pale blue characterize the visual palette of postwar Grand Budapest scenes, manifesting the hotel's diminished prestige."

It headlined the 10th Glasgow Film Festival as the event's opening film, held February 20 \u2013 March 2, 2014, before hosting its North American premiere on February 27 at the Film at Lincoln Center in New York City. Fox Searchlight spearheaded the marketing campaign. Their strategy involved merchandise releases, a global publicity tour, the creation of mock websites about Zubrowkan culture, and trailers highlighting the cast's star power. One of their most significant marketing tactics, instructional videos detailing the creation of desserts mirroring Mendl's baked goods, used fan footage submitted to the producers for TV-commercial spots on cooking networks. In conjunction with their collaboration with Anderson, Prada showcased its capsule collection of custom luggage from in-store displays at the Berlin flagship store.

General release expanded to Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, the United States (March 7), and two other international markets the second week. The Grand Budapest Hotel opened to a few US theaters as part of a month-long limited platform release, initially screening from four arthouse theaters in New York and Los Angeles. After the 87th Academy Awards' nominations announcement, Fox re-expanded the film's theater presence for a brief, multi-city re-release campaign. Fox Searchlight released The Grand Budapest Hotel on DVD and Blu-ray on June 17, 2014.

The film's performance plateaued in North America after a strong start, but finished the theatrical run as Anderson's highest-grossing film in the market. It performed strongest in key European and Asian markets. Germany was the most lucrative market, and the film's link to that country boosted the box office performance. South Korea, Australia, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom represented some of the film's largest takings. The Grand Budapest Hotel earned $59.3\u00a0million (34.3 percent of its earnings) in the United States and Canada and $113.6\u00a0million (65.7 percent) overseas, for a worldwide total of $172.9\u00a0million, making it the 46th-highest-grossing film of 2014, and Anderson's highest-grossing film to date. The film posted $2.8\u00a0million from 172 theaters during its opening week in France, trailing Supercondriaque and Non-Stop. In Paris, The Grand Budapest Hotel screenings were the weekend's biggest numbers. The film's $16,220 per-theater average was the best opening for any Anderson-directed project in France to date. In its second week the number of theaters grew to 192, and The Grand Budapest Hotel grossed another $1.64\u00a0million at the French box office. Earnings dropped by just 30 percent the following weekend, for a total gross of $1.1\u00a0million. By March 24, the box office posted five percent increase, and The Grand Budapest Hotel French release had taken $8.2\u00a0million overall. The week of March 6 saw The Grand Budapest Hotel take $6.2\u00a0million from 727 theaters internationally, yielding the strongest figures in Belgium ($156,000, from 12 theaters), Austria ($162,000, from 29 theaters), Germany ($1.138\u00a0million, from 163 theaters), and the United Kingdom (top-three debut, with \u00a31.53\u00a0million or $1.85\u00a0million from 284 theaters). It increased 11 percent in Germany the following weekend to $1.1\u00a0million, and The Grand Budapest Hotel yielded $5.2\u00a0million from German cinemas by the week of March 31. It sustained the box office momentum into the second week of UK general release with improved sales from an expanded theater presence, and by the third week, the film topped the national top ten with \u00a31.27\u00a0million ($1.55\u00a0million) from 458 screens, buoyed by positive reviews in the media. After a month it had earned $13.2 million in the UK. The Grand Budapest Hotel expansion to other overseas markets continued toward the end of March, marked by significant releases in Sweden (first place, with $498,108), Spain (third, with $1\u00a0million), and South Korea (the country's biggest specialty film opening ever, with $622,109 from 162 cinemas). During its second week of release in South Korea, the film's box office ballooned by 70 percent to $996,000. On its opening week elsewhere, The Grand Budapest Hotel earned $1.8\u00a0million in Australia, $382,000 in Brazil, and $1\u00a0million in Italy. By May 27, the film's international gross exceeded $100\u00a0million. In the United States, The Grand Budapest Hotel opened to a $202,792-per theater average from a four-theater $811,166 overall gross, breaking the record for most robust live-action limited release previously held by Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master (2012). The return, exceeding Fox's expectations for the weekend, was the best US opening for an Anderson-directed project to date. The Grand Budapest Hotel also eclipsed Moonrise Kingdom $130,749 per-theater average, Anderson's highest-opening limited release until then. Fading interest in films hoping to capitalize on Academy Awards prestige and its crossover appeal to younger, casual moviegoers were crucial to The Grand Budapest Hotel early box office success. The film sustained the box office momentum as large suburban cineplexes were added to its limited run, racking $3.6\u00a0million the second week and $6.7\u00a0million the following weekend. The film officially entered wide release the week of March 30 by screening in 977 theaters across North America. New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Toronto, Washington, and Montreal were The Grand Budapest Hotel most successful North American cities. Its theater count peaked at 1,467 in mid-April before a gradual decline. By the end of the month, the film's domestic gross topped $50\u00a0million.

It appeared on professional rankings from BBC and IndieWire, based on retrospective appraisal, as one of the greatest films of the twenty-first century. Many of the reviews complimented The Grand Budapest Hotel for its craftsmanship, often singling out the film's zany sensibility and Anderson's expertise for further praise, the latter for the creation of a fanciful onscreen world which does not take itself too seriously. Occasionally The Grand Budapest Hotel drew criticism for evading some of the harsh realities of the subject matter; according to a Vanity Fair reviewer, the film's devotion to a \"kitschy adventure story that feels curiously weightless, at times even arbitrary\" undermined any thoughtful moral. The comic treatment of a madcap adventure was cited among the strengths of the film, though sometimes the fragmented storytelling approach was considered a flaw by some critics, such as The New Yorker David Denby, for following a sequence of events that seemed to lack emotional continuity. The actors' performances were routinely mentioned in the reviews. Journalists felt the ensemble brought The Grand Budapest Hotel ethos to life in comedic and dramatic moments, particularly Ralph Fiennes, whose performance was called \"transformative\" and \"total perfection\". San Francisco Chronicle Mick LaSalle felt Fiennes's casting was the study of a reserved actor exhibiting the fullest extent of his emotional range, and Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan believed he exuded an \"unbounded but carefully calibrated zeal\", the only such actor capable of realizing Anderson's vision of a \"will-o'-the-wisp world heft and reality while still being faithful to the singular spirit that underlies it\". On the other hand, characterization in The Grand Budapest Hotel drew varying responses from reviewers; Gustave, for example, was described as a man \"of convincing feelings\", \"sweetly wistful\", but a protagonist lacking the depth of other prolific heroes in the Anderson canon, emblematic of a film that doesn't quite appear to fully flesh out the core cast of characters. The Grand Budapest Hotel has an approval rating of  based on  professional reviews on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of . Its critical consensus reads, \"Typically stylish but deceptively thoughtful, The Grand Budapest Hotel finds Wes Anderson once again using ornate visual environments to explore deeply emotional ideas.\" Metacritic (which uses a weighted average) assigned The Grand Budapest Hotel a score of 88 out of 100 based on 48 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\"."

        "content": "The Grand Budapest Hotel was not an immediate favorite to dominate the 87th Academy Awards season. The film's early March opening was thought to deter any chance of Oscar recognition, since the usual industry practice to better position feature films for awards attention is to schedule a fall release. The last spring season releases to achieve Best Picture success until then were Erin Brockovich (2000) and The Silence of the Lambs (1991). As the Academy Award nominations approached, a frontrunner had not emerged, partly as a result of a critical backlash against the season's biggest contenders, such as American Sniper, Selma and The Imitation Game. But US critics spread their honors for The Grand Budapest Hotel when compiling their end-of-year lists, and the film soon gained momentum thanks to a significant presence in the award circuit. Fox Searchlight president Nancy Utley attributed the film's ascendancy to its months-long presence on multi-media home entertainment platforms, which provided greater viewing opportunity for Academy voters. It led the Academy Award season with nine nominations (including Best Picture and Best Director), tied with Birdman. The film received four Oscars: Best Original Score, Best Production Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and Best Costume Design. The Grand Budapest Hotel was a candidate for other awards for excellence in writing, acting, directing, and technical achievement. It received nominations such as the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture and the C\u00e9sar Award for Best Foreign Film. Among the film's other wins include three Critics' Choice Awards, five British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs), and a Golden Globe in the category of Best Motion Picture\u2014Musical or Comedy."

        "content": "Mr. Fischoeder, who needs a new attraction at Wonder Wharf, arrives at Bob's Burgers to seek guidance from the Belchers. Bob remembers that the town served as the filming location of a shark-themed \u201880s B movie, The Deepening. The family discovers that the original prop shark from the movie is up for sale and convinces Fischoeder to buy it. However, Teddy ominously objects. At the unveiling of the shark, the Belchers find out Fischoeder has filled it with diesel. The shark, which is now able to move, nearly causes an accident by ripping off a woman\u2019s prosthetic arm. Early the next morning, the Belcher kids sneak off to Wonder Wharf to steal the shark\u2019s fin for \"mechanical shark fin soup.\" Gene mounts the shark with a knife to cut off its fin, but he accidentally knocks the shark off its perch: the kids leave, and Louise tells her siblings to act like they were \"never there.\" That same morning, Bob notices people panicking outside and goes to investigate. He arrives at Wonder Wharf to find the mechanical shark flopping around on the ground. Fischoeder reveals there is no way to stop the shark until it runs out of gas; furthermore, he is reluctant to stop it, as it is now drawing larger crowds than ever. Bob worries the shark will leave the wharf and pleads with Fischoeder, but it is already too late: the shark smashes through the gates of Wonder Wharf and runs amok in traffic. Bob, as \u201cBlock Captain,\u201d rallies the local business owners to figure out what to do about the shark. Tina, who empathized with the shark after watching The Deepening, tries to dissuade the townspeople from stopping its progress. After she impulsively confesses that she and the kids knocked over the shark, the townspeople begin to turn on the Belchers. But Teddy encourages the townspeople to work together, and they begin brainstorming how to stop the shark, which is now heading towards Bob's restaurant. Each of the townspeople's ideas goes horribly wrong and only serves to make the shark more dangerous: a spike strip becomes attached to the shark, an oil slick intended to \u201cslow its momentum\u201d ends up making it faster, and after it hits a telephone pole, it becomes electrified. Finally, the shark falls into a hole in the ground that the townspeople dug to catch it. This seems to work until subterranean noises indicate the shark has eaten its way into Bob\u2019s basement. Bob, Teddy, and Mort enter the restaurant to try and stop the shark. Teddy reveals the reason for his hatred of the shark: he acted as a lifeguard in The Deepening. While talking to a girl on set, the prop operator startled him with the shark, causing him to spill his drink on the girl and embarrass himself. Bob asks Teddy why he resents the shark instead of the operator; Teddy stops to consider this logic briefly before deciding he still hates the shark. The shark emerges from the ground, knocking Mort into the basement. Teddy falls into the shark\u2019s mouth, though his \"boydle\" prevents him from being crushed by its teeth. Tina gets the idea to fill the shark with ice cream from their soft serve machine, which has fallen inside the shark\u2019s body. Bob is able to plug in the machine, and the shark, now filled with ice cream, finally ends its rampage. On a news report, Hugo, the health inspector and \"Quadrant Captain,\" takes credit for stopping the shark."

Meanwhile, the monster-movie parody works in large part because, as everyone plays it straight, there\u2019s Tina in the corner, defending a mechanical shark on the grounds that it was used in a movie to depict a confused shark. Bob tries to tell her that she\u2019s wrong by comparing it to a toaster, but Tina\u2019s empathy knows no bounds: 'Our toaster is also confused. It doesn\u2019t know why we put bagels in it.'\" Ross Bonaime of Paste gave the episode 8.3 out of 10, saying \"The Deepening\u201d is one of the more fulfilling episodes of Bob\u2019s Burgers\u2019 third season, making the family one singular unit against the shark (even though Tina\u2019s allegiances are split), and having the family forced against the town is a familiar scenario, but it still works well. \u201cThe Deepening\u201d has one focused storyline instead of splitting the family into several that don\u2019t feel fully fleshed out, and that makes for one of the funniest episodes so far this year.\" The episode received a 2.0 rating and was watched by a total of 4.66 million people. This made it the fourth most watched show on Animation Domination that night, beating The Cleveland Show but losing to The Simpsons with 7.46 million."

        "content": "The episode begins with Cobra forces led by Destro (Isaac Singleton Jr.) attacking the Taj Mahal. They are intercepted by G.I. Joe troops led by Flint (Bill Ratner). Among the force is the (rather dysfunctional) study group; Annie (Alison Brie), codenamed \"Tight Ship\", who questions their orders, Britta (Gillian Jacobs), codenamed \"Buzzkill\", who comments on her suggestive outfit with inappropriate language. Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown), codenamed \"Three Kids\", who is too busy talking to her kids on the phone to focus on the battle, and Jeff (Joel McHale), codenamed \u201cWingman\u201d. Jeff shoots down Destro's plane, but takes things too far when he shoots out Destro's parachute. A surprised Destro falls to his death, causing Flint and the rest of the Joes to stare in horror. Wingman, Three Kids, Buzzkill, and Tight Ship are charged with violence, suggestive language, and mature situations unbecoming of G.I. Joe at a court-martial presided over by Duke (Michael Bell), Flint, and Scarlett (Mary McDonald-Lewis). Wingman defends the first killing in G.I. Joe history by countering it should be their duty to eliminate Cobra because it is a ruthless terrorist organization, but the four are sent to jail. In the jail, the Group meets \"Fourth Wall\", played by Abed (Danny Pudi), in the adjacent cell. Fourth Wall explains that they are in a cartoon and that he has infiltrated a Cobra dig site called \"Greendale\". Wingman loses consciousness, sending him to a live-action, mock G.I. Joe commercial featuring three young boys playing with G.I. Joes and their accessories. Wingman regains consciousness in the G.I. Joe cartoon where he hears beeps resembling hospital equipment and Annie's and Britta's voice calling him Jeff. Wingman dismisses this, saying he belongs in G.I. Joe. Meanwhile, at Cobra Headquarters, Cobra Commander (Rob Schrab) delivers a eulogy at Destro's funeral. He is interrupted by \"Vice Cobra Assistant Commander\", played by Dean Pelton (Jim Rash), who delivers news of an energy surge at the Greendale site. Cobra then initiates an attack of the G.I. Joe base to avenge Destro's death. Cobra bombs a hole in Wingman's jail cell, allowing the Group to escape. Wingman tries to help out in the battle, but he just ends up killing more Cobra soldiers and accidentally setting Lifeline on fire, causing him to burn to death. The Squad leaves in a \u201cSubmachopter\u201d tiltrotor and Fourth Wall suggests going to the site at Greendale. The mention of the word causes Wingman to lose consciousness again, sending him into another live-action G.I. Joe action figure commercial where the Squad is now called \u201cThe Mutineers\u201d because of Wingman's fatal sharpshooting skills. Wingman regains consciousness and the Mutineers arrive at the Greendale site. The Mutineers easily defeat opposition and enter Study Room F, where Wingman realizes that he works at Greendale as a teacher named Jeff Winger, and that this cartoon reality is in his imagination. Jeff leaves to go to his office and realizes why he is unconscious \u2013 because he drank the bottle of Scotch whiskey and took anti-aging pills from Koreatown. He returns to the group and explains that he took them because he has been lying about his age. Fourth Wall informs him of the different layers of existence, where he is currently in the 1980s cartoon layer. He explains that Jeff sees visions of the next layer, the toy commercial plane, which separates him from the real world where Jeff must go to confront the reason for the hallucination. Jeff says he doesn't want to go back because he doesn't want to be a middle-aged community college teacher; he wants to be in G.I. Joe because he is immortal in this cartoon world. Just then, Cobra and G.I. Joe forces intervene to reveal they have joined forces to become \"Jo-Bra\" and capture Wingman, as his ability to kill means that he is the biggest threat to both of them. Cobra Commander and Duke ask Jeff questions about real life that make Jeff realize he cannot live in this cartoon universe forever. Jeff tricks them and uses his jet pack to escape the cartoon reality. Jeff leaves the toy commercial layer and enters reality where he is on a hospital bed, surrounded by the members of the Save Greendale committee. Jeff reveals that he's 40 years old, to no surprise of the group; as they were aware that he wasn't around his early 30s. It is revealed that Jeff took Korean anti-aging pills to appear younger which land him in the hospital. They nevertheless support him and say he should not have been embarrassed to reveal his age. The group gives him a present of a coffee mug they bought at the hospital gift shop that says \"It's an Old Boy\", with the \"Old\" written in. He tells them to bring it in for a hug and they all laugh while the camera fades to black. The animated end scene shows Buzzkill catching two kids spray-painting their names onto a park structure. She botches a Public Service Announcement and gives a cynically complex message before Fourth Wall intervenes to give a short message: \"Graffiti is bad. Go play sports.\""

Joe's Duke, though with inverted colors for his costume; Annie, as \"Tight Ship,\" was an analogue to Shipwreck; Abed's \"Fourth Wall\" was an homage to the Native American G.I. Joe, Spirit; Shirley, as \"Three Kids,\" wore Stalker's costume; Professor Duncan, as \"Xim-Xam\" (and his twin \"Mix-Max\"), was an homage to the Crimson Guard Twins; Professor Hickey as \"Major Dick,\" with an eye-patch and costume to that of Major Bludd; Chang, as \"Overkill\" wore Quick Kick's costume; and Dean Pelton, as \"Vice Cobra Assistant Commander\", served as a foil to Cobra Commander.

        "content": "Series creator and co-showrunner Dan Harmon initially announced that there would be an animated episode during the cast and crew's visit to the San Diego Comic-Con in July 2013.  Series writer and co-showrunner Chris McKenna said the idea for the concept of the episode came about in a simple way: \"I think Harmon said, 'Let's do a G.I. Joe episode!'\" McKenna said that the show wanted to pay tribute to the 1980s animated series: \"[G.I. Joe] was something from our childhood that was very important to us and we had fond memories of it, and we thought it would be a cool way to do another animated episode. Like all Community episodes, it takes on a certain style. This one has a very specific story reason for it. I don\u2019t want to give too much away, but our characters find themselves on a Wizard of Oz-type journey through the world of G.I. Joe. \u2026 There\u2019s a mystery that Jeff in particular has to get to the bottom of.\" McKenna added that the Community team had been working overtime to craft \"a loving homage to the G.I. Joe series.\" Though production for the live-action episodes had been completed in December 2013, the cast recorded their voices in late March 2014.  McKenna said the delay was due to the fact that they broke and re-broke the story several times in order to utilize all the regulars and guest stars in the Community universe, as well as to find a proper justification for using the animated medium to tell their story.  McKenna said that Rob Schrab (Scud: The Disposable Assassin) was the \"perfect person\" to direct the episode and \"he's absolutely a maniac trying to get it together.\" McKenna explained that this episode is not simply a sketch, but that the characters take on this style to carry out a story that takes place in the real world, which Harmon stated was a story was about \"age and dying.\" The episode was animated by Harmon's animation studio, Starburns Industries, which had previously animated the claymation episode, \"Abed's Uncontrollable Christmas\". The episode was animated with the permission of the G.I. Joe's toy manufacturer, Hasbro. Harmon had this to say about Hasbro's willingness to lend its iconic style: \"The weird thing was how cooperative they were. Not that we maligned their product in any way, but their product is a syndicated, children's cartoon with a different rating than ours, so it's like part of the point of the episode is that there's a different sensibility within this world. So I thought they'd have more problems than they did with the idea of Jeff Winger's G.I. Joe character accidentally killing people. But they were cool with that! More power to them, because they were very, very gracious with their product. That's really cool too, because you're accustomed in TV that if someone pulls out a Snickers bar, it always says 'Snookers.' So the weird thing is that when you see actual branding like that, it hits your brain like it's kind of revolutionary. Which is dumb, because why should that be? But you see the G.I. Joe logo and we have G.I. Joe characters talking to our characters\u2026\""

        "content": "Critics gave the episode generally positive reviews, with many remarking on the authentic feel of the 1980s cartoon G.I. Joe. The episode drew criticism, however, due to unfamiliarity of many in the audience with the cartoon to which the episode paid homage. Brian Collins of Badass Digest praised the episode's use of the animated medium to tell an essential story in the Community mythology. He said this episode proved \"once again that in Community, there's (almost) no such thing as a throwaway episode.\" Collins enjoyed how the episode immediately distinguished itself from the 1980s cartoon by questioning the lack of deaths when firing multiple weapons while fighting a terrorist organization like Cobra. He commended the episode for being frank with the viewer from the beginning with the idea that the episode took place in Jeff's mind, unlike the fourth season's finale. Collins noted how this episode compared to the second season's stop-motion episode where Abed had a mental breakdown. The ultimate reveal, however, in this episode that Jeff is in a coma (due to alcohol poisoning mixed with suspect anti-aging pills) made the episode much darker, Collins said. Collins also praised the episode for delivering a grounded piece of canon about Jeff turning 40 years old despite making him a \u201cbit too old\u201d for the 23/24-year-old Annie: \u201cIt's a daring move, and the fact that he's been \u2018lying\u2019 about his age doesn't quite land since he's never revealed it in an episode, but it's one of the many things that helps keep the show grounded in more of a reality than we're used to on a sitcom.\u201d The reveal is especially poignant, Collins wrote, because Jeff was now the one with the crisis, where previous episodes saw dramatic stories such as Troy leaving (Abed's crisis), Pierce dying (the Group's crisis), and Britta seeing her activist friends move on. Collins ended by saying \u201cit\u2019s a goddamn hilarious episode. Rob Schrab (the director of the episode) plays Cobra Commander, and had me laughing out loud nearly every time he spoke - particularly during Destro's eulogy, which he botches because he's never had to give one before now.\u201d Joe Matar from Den of Geek rated the episode \u201c2 out of 5 stars,\u201d though qualifying his rating by confessing he \u201ccan\u2019t even remember watching a single G.I. Joe [episode] and I certainly didn\u2019t own any of the action figures.\u201d  This mirrored the rating given by Dave Bunting (Vulture), who also qualified his rating by saying he \u201cnever watched that mid-\u201980s animated series, and the line of action figures that inspired the cartoon also didn't mean much to me.\u201d Similar to Bunting's reason for the lack of connection with the episode, Matar explained that though this episode is a loving homage to the old G.I. Joe action figures, he couldn't \u201cimagine this episode holding that much appeal for you. It certainly didn\u2019t for me.\u201d Matar criticized the episode's heavy dependence upon \u201cnostalgia and recognition of a bygone era of budget animation and cheesy toy commercials,\u201d adding that \u201ceither your familiarity with this old junk will be triggered from frame one and you\u2019ll be grinning the whole episode or you\u2019ll sit there, stony-faced, at times bewildered, like yours truly.\u201d Despite his harsh criticism, Matar explained that he understood the irony that the characters were \u201cupset when someone actually dies.\u201d Matar resented this \u201cin-joke\u201d as much of the story hinged upon this concept. Unlike Collins, Matar did not appreciate Jeff imagining the entire episode like in the fourth-season finale: \u201cSomething continually upsetting to me is the way Season 5 at its worst reminds me of Season 4, a period in Community\u2019s life that I don\u2019t even consider to be the same show. But remember the abysmal Season 4 finale where Jeff kind of had a psychotic break and imagined the Darkest Timeline was real and then it turned out it was all a dream? Well, this one makes a lot more sense and it doesn\u2019t cheaply hide the \u2018dream\u2019 aspect so as to use it as a twist at the end, but still, it feels lazier than I expect Community to be.\u201d Emily VanDerWerff's (The A.V. Club) unfamiliarity with the 1980s cartoon did not negatively affect her rating, however, as she gave the episode an \u201cA-.\u201d   VanDerWerff said that though she was too young to have knowledge of the cartoon, she enjoyed this spiritual sequel to season two's stop-motion episode, \"Abed's Uncontrollable Christmas\". She said that she enjoyed the episode turning into a \u201cweird, Inception-inspired attempt to break out of Jeff\u2019s subconscious.\u201d She also enjoyed the episode \u201ckept getting more and more ridiculous as Jeff struggled to wrangle everything together into a coherent narrative funny.\u201d Like Collins, VanDerWerff enjoyed that the stakes were established early on and that it was revealed that the episode took place in Jeff's head \u2013 similar to Abed's Uncontrollable Christmas taking place in Abed's head. She praised the episode for being able to handle darker topics, explaining that Jeff wasn't actively trying to commit suicide, but taking pills thinking it will bring him youth: \u201cThe episode also doesn\u2019t shy away from how that act of self-destruction might as well be subconscious suicide anyway. Jeff\u2019s horribly depressed about being 40 and having only made it as far as a community college instructor. Even if he\u2019s surrounded with friends, he\u2019s not in the place he thought he would be when he was a little boy and imagined greater things for himself. Adulthood might carry with it pleasures that childhood doesn\u2019t\u2014from naked breasts and Scotch all the way up to deeper emotional connections with other human beings\u2014but childhood carries with it the pleasure of not really knowing how much sorrow and despair the world can hold. That\u2019s why nostalgia for the things we loved as children is such a powerful opiate: It takes us back to a place where we knew we were loved, as Don Draper would have it. I\u2019m not saying this episode doubles as a subtle critique of all of those Buzzfeed articles about how great it was to be a kid in the \u201890s, but I\u2019m not not saying that either. We all get older and have to put away childish things. Getting lost in them can be a danger in and of itself.\u201d VanDerWerff also praised director Rob Schrab's ability to \u201cbeautifully [capture] the animation limitations of \u201880s afternoon cartoons\u2026[and] the flat lighting of \u201880s toy commercials.\u201d VanDerWerff requested to give Shirley more material in future episodes, while appreciating her name \u201cThree Kids\u201d as a joke to how rarely the show gives her more than a catchphrase. Though she found the episode to be \u201cvery enjoyable\u201d and \u201cvery funny,\u201d VanDerWerff lodged a minor complaint at the final scene in the hospital: \u201cI think works a little too hard to put a cap on everything that doesn\u2019t leave the audience contemplating their own mortality\u2026But I still thought the episode built nicely to a place of genuine existential despair and then sort of\u2026 shoved it right back down so we could have the standard group hug\u2026It\u2019s not a huge flaw\u2014Community has been walking right up to the edge of the howling void and then walking right back with a hug since 2009\u2014but it\u2019s one that nonetheless kept me from completely embracing everything that was going on in the end.\u201d"

        "content": "At night, while the Moomin family and residents of Moominvalley enjoy a party around a bonfire atop a cliffside, a pirate ship mistaking the blaze for a lighthouse crash into rocks at sea, forcing the crew to abandon ship and their hostages, Mymble and Little My. The next morning, Moomin is stuck between deciding to help Moominmamma with washing, going fishing with Snufkin and acting out a scene with Snorkmaiden, wishing he knew how to say no to others. While acting out the scene, Moomin spots Mymble struggling to swim ashore and dives into the ocean to save her from drowning. Spotting the shipwreck, the Moomins decide to go and salvage what they can, taking a mirror, books, a chest of tropical seeds and several crates of fireworks, but leaving the chest of gold. Little My (who stayed in the ship's crows nest) eventually follows the family home from the ship on the back of a shark. The pirates follow the family back to Moominhouse upon spotting them with their cargo, but leave after discovering their gold is still on the ship, which has begun to sink. At night, Snorkmaiden suggests going to the Riviera after reading a magazine with her idol, Audrey Glamour. The Moomins, Snorkmaiden and Little My set sail, but get lost in a storm and wind up on a deserted island. A box floats ashore containing thousands of bugs uttering insults and bad language, which the group gathers into a bag to take with them. At night, Snorkmaiden notices the lights of the Riviera not too far away from their location, and the family arrive on the shores the next morning. While exploring the town, the family arrive at The Grand, the Riviera's resort hotel. Moominpappa introduces the family as \"DeMoomin of Moominvalley\", and are offered the Royal Suite to stay in. The family struggles to fit in among the affluent residents, however Moominpappa soon becomes friends with Marquis Mongaga, an artist who admires his bohemian eccentricity, and Snorkmaiden begins to spend her time with Audrey Glamour, and playboy Clark Tresco, much to Moomin's displeasure. Moomin and Moominmamma, both feeling that they don't fit into the rich lifestyle, decide to go and live under their boat on the beach. Mongaga invites Moominpappa to his mansion where he shows him his art, consisting of walking elephant sculptures, and admits to him that he would gladly give up his rich lifestyle to live a bohemian lifestyle like Moominpappa. After pushing the statue of the town governor into the river and replacing it with one of the elephant statues, Mongaga comes to temporarily live with the Moomin family at the beach, where he carves more of his sculptures, and inspires Moomin to create a sculpture of his own. After sleeping rough and being attacked by a resident's dogs, Mongaga decides to depart back to his home, thanking the Moomins' for their hospitality and leaving his statues as a parting gift. Moomin, fed up with seeing Clark with Snorkmaiden, challenges him to a duel for Snorkmaiden's love the next morning.  While not adept with the sword, Moomin ultimately triumphs after bashing Clark on the head with the hilt. The directors of the hotel decide to evict the Moomin family as their eccentricity has made the reputation of the hotel suffer. Ordered to pay for their stay with a hefty bill, the family try to pay with Mongaga's elephant statues, which are deemed worthless because so many of them exist. Snork Maiden decides to use her stashed casino winnings in order to pay their bill. Her money greatly exceeds the amount of the bill, but she allows the hotel to keep the money. That evening, Snorkmaiden finds Moomin's statue, a sculpture of her as a mermaid, and the two embrace. Moominpappa decides to give homes to Mongaga's elephant statues, and Moominmamma opens her tropical rock garden to the public. Upon arriving at the town hall with a statue, the Mayor realises that Moominpappa was responsible for pushing the Governor's statue into the river and orders his arrest. After being chased through the town by the police, Moominpappa and the rest of the family quickly set sail. Moominmamma releases the bugs from the bag to halt the officers, which quickly swarm over the town with a plague of insults and bad language, causing fights among the residents. The Moomin family get caught in a storm on their way back to Moominvalley, and decide to jettison some of their pots of tropical plants to lighten the load, inadvertently including Moomin's statue. Lost in the fog, with the plants still on board having overgrown into full trees, the family are eventually found and brought back to land by Snufkin. The family go back to their peaceful lives in Moominvalley, and Moomin and Snorkmaiden embrace on the cliffside while flying kites with Mymble and Little My."

        "content": "According to Sophia Jansson of the Moomin Characters, the company had been careful with giving the rights to new film adaptions about the Moomins for years. When the participation rights with the Telescreen expired, Sophia Jansson became interested in the idea of animated film based on the Moomin comic strip story. Producer Hanna Hemil\u00e4, who is Sophia's close friend, told Sophia about French animation director Xavier Picard, who was interested to adapt comic strips to the big screen. They contacted Picard and the film started production in France in 2010. The film is animated traditionally, hand drawn animation with a reduced color scale for the backgrounds in order to maintain continuity with the black-and-white comic strips. Pictak Cie worked on developing the visuals of the film. Chinese Sandman Animation Studio did 120,000 drawings for animation and Handle Productions produced the film. The film marks the feature film directorial debut of Xavier Picard. Picard was not aware of the Moomin characters before he discovered them 20 years ago in Japan, but he has been particularly fascinated by comic strips and has stated to want translate the art of Tove Jansson into animation. The Finnish voice cast of the film was confirmed in August 2014 featuring Maria Sid as Moominmamma, while the English voice cast was confirmed in a September 2014 press announcement. The film's score was composed by many Finnish and French composers, including Jean de Aguiar, Panu Aaltio, Timo Lassy, Milla Viljamaa and Anna-Karin Korhonen. The film stays faithful to Tove Jansson's original story in the original comic strip, with the addition of a few characters and story lines: Little My and Snufkin, have been added to the film, in addition to some other characters from the Moomin comic strip. While the production crew felt that the Riviera is fun and dramatic setting, they have also add a side story at the beginning of the film, that takes place in Moominvalley, and where Moomins got their idea for the sea voyage. The reason for this was to introduce the dwelling place of the Moomins for the international audience. Sophia Jansson herself approved the change."

Sergeant Bill Thatcher (Bill Boyd) is left in charge of a small rear guard of four men to cover the battalion's retreat before it is cut off. During heavy shelling, Bill tries to comfort his men after each is wounded. The first, \"Bud\" (Russell Gleason), relates his story of how he joined the military, leaving the family farm to enlist, despite his mother's pleas for him not to become involved in foreign conflicts. As he finishes his story, he dies. The second doughboy, Lew Cavanaugh (Lew Cody), is a New York playboy who used enlistment as a way to have a final night of pleasure with one of his conquests, never realizing that he would die on a French battlefield. The third American, the unsoldierly Jim Mobley (James Gleason), is not as badly wounded as the other two soldiers and tells his story of his wife's displeasure after he announces his intention to enlist and his own consternation at his inability explain to her why. Thatcher then relates his own story, where he was engaged to a German immigrant back in the United States but did not wed her due to their differences over the \"Great War\". Shortly after, the Germans attack again, during which Bill and Jim defend their position and blow up a bridge to cover the retreat of their battalion, but are badly wounded. A German soldier tries to bayonet the unconscious Bill but is stopped by another soldier. Both are captured and sent to a German hospital, where Bill is discovered by his erstwhile fianc\u00e9, Katherine (Lissi Arna). She saves his life by persuading the German doctor to allow Bill, slowly bleeding to death but not allowed a transfusion because too many German patients are in need of one, to be transfused with her blood. After the armistice, with Bill recovered and decorated along with Jim for the defense of Nevremont, they celebrate the end of the fighting with Katherine."

        "content": "The film was announced as part of Path\u00e9's 30-picture schedule for 1930\u201331 in February 1930. It was considered the premier film of Path\u00e9's schedule for the season. Boyd was attached to the project by the end of February, as part of his new deal with Path\u00e9, in which he would only appear in Path\u00e9 \"specials\". Beyond Victory was to be the first film of that new deal. James Gleason was added to the cast in a featured role in March 1930. It was the first film for Gleason under his new exclusive long-term contract with Path\u00e9. At the same time, it was revealed that John Robinson would be helming the film. Robert Armstrong was attached to the picture in early April. Also in early April, it was announced that Mauri Grashin had been signed as screenwriter to a long-term contract by Path\u00e9, and Beyond Victory would be his first project. In June 1930, it was reported that Dorothy Burgess had been signed for a featured role in the film, and Zasu Pitts involvement with the picture as a knife-throwing entertainer was revealed, along with James Gleason's participation. In mid-June, Charles O'Loughlin was announced as the sound engineer on the project, although the final version included work from four sound engineers. The Film Daily reported that the film's producer, E.B. Derr, in conjunction with the director, John Robertson, took an unusual step and had each sequence in the film written by a different screenwriter. The writers included James Seymour, James Gleason, Lynn Riggs, Thomas Lennon, Mauri Grashin, and Garret Fort. The concept was to have five independent stories intertwined around a central theme. In Glason's adaptation, he wrote a role into the final version of the script for himself. By early May pre-production on the film was almost completed.  And production on the film had begun by the middle of May. Also in May, the film was scheduled to be released on July 13, 1930. In early June, Robert Armstrong was replaced by Lew Cody. Armstrong was delayed on the production of Railroad Man. By June 15, 1930, the cast had grown to include William Boyd, Fred Scott, James Gleason, Russell Gleason, June Collyer, Helen Twelvetrees, Zasu Pitts, Purnell Pratt, and Bert Roach. The following week, Richard Tucker was added to the cast. Production on the film was almost complete by the end of June. On June 26, the final cast list was reported. Additions to the cast were: William Holden, E.H. Calvert, Fred Walton, Wade Boteler, Rockliffe Fellowes, Helen Baxter, George Stone, Elinor Millard, Ed Deering, Bert Sprotte, Conrad Seidemann, Paul Weigle, and Charles Giblyn. Millard was a stage actress, and this movie was her film debut. In addition to the unusual script development strategy used by Path\u00e9, they also employed a U.S. Army Colonel, Frank S. Long, as a technical advisor on the film. A new type of silencer for the camera was employed on the picture, allowing a close-up of Boyd's hand signing a document to pick up the pen's scratching noise on the paper. The film included actual war footage from Path\u00e9's film library, which at the time had one of the most extensive collections of World War I footage. While the film's main cinematography was done by Norbert Brodine, William Dietz was hired to do some special trick photography. By July 11, 1930, production on the film was completed. By the end of the month, the picture was in the editing room. However, on July 23 it was announced that the film was being shelved for the time being, with portions to be re-shot. By August 21, the film was being advertised in major industry journals. In the released version of the film, scenes with Helen Twelvetrees and June Collyer were completely cut. In October it was announced that the film was scheduled for release on November 30, with the film undergoing some large re-shoots under the direction of E.H. Griffith. However, the film went back into the editing room in early December. The film's release date was eventually pushed back to be included in the 1931 release schedule. Path\u00e9 cut its planned 20 films for the 1930\u201331 schedule to 9, with Beyond Victory scheduled as the last of the nine. The reason cited was Path\u00e9's acquisition by RKO Pictures. Beyond Victory was one of three Path\u00e9 films which were purchased outright by RKO."

Unknown to Smeed, there was a witness to the murder (Nachez). While the investigation unfolds, Smeed tries to cover up the evidence and eliminate people who can implicate him. Another deputy (Gentry), who has always admired Smeed, defends him to his girlfriend (Alvarado) but is astonished when Alvarado translates the written eyewitness account (from the Spanish) by Nachez. Smeed kidnaps Nachez, taking him to a mine, where he kills him and hides the body. Gentry shows up at the mine but is over-powered by Smeed, tied up, and left to be buried in a cave-in caused by Smeed setting a charge. The marshal arrives with his posse and hunts down Smeed inside the mine, using an alternate entry. In the meantime, Gentry, who survives the cave-in, unties himself and joins the hunt. The posse corners Smeed, who draws first, and is killed by Gentry. In the closing scene, Gentry (with his new bride, Alvarado), is presented with a new badge by Forrester and congratulated for being appointed to the position of marshal of Arizona's Northern Territory."

His circle of acquaintances includes Winslow Smith, a motorcycle-riding, leather-jacketed, self-styled rebel, whose image is undermined by the fact that at 24 he is still a virgin; Oliver, a homosexual interior decorator who stages elaborate parties and tries, unsuccessfully, to seduce his male guests; and Jennifer, a 21-year-old tenant in Jonathan's building, whose sojourn in New York City to \"find herself\" is being subsidized by her parents. While attending one of Oliver's wild soirees, Jonathan is accosted by a nymphomaniacal former bedmate, Naomi, who drags him into the bathroom, strips off her clothes, and invites him to join her in the fur-lined tub. Instead, he returns to his apartment, visits Jennifer, and explains why he must maintain emotional detachment. Jennifer, however, is such an understanding listener that she and Jonathan are soon making love. At Christmas, Jonathan takes Jennifer to spend the holidays in Darien, Connecticut, with his suburbanite parents\u2014a possessive and petulant mother and a potentially alcoholic stepfather. But his mother angrily discovers Jonathan and Jennifer nude in the bed, and after a seasonal party leads to further generation gap warfare Jonathan and Jennifer abruptly return to the city. Although drawn to Jennifer, Jonathan is soured by the prospects of married life and is even becoming increasingly apathetic toward his friends. One night, attempting to explain his disenchantment to Jennifer, he enters her apartment and finds her in bed with Winslow. Shattered, Jonathan dazedly drives his cab through the city until finally, in a rage, he plunges off the docks into the river. Recovering in the intensive care unit of a hospital, Jonathan is visited by his friends as well as by Jennifer, who pleads for a second chance to demonstrate her love. Instead Jonathan slips out of the hospital, packs his bags, and boards a train for Des Moines, Iowa.

They studied medicine in the same college and wanted to marry, but her father arranged an alliance with an entrepreneur named Karthik. In the present, Rishi, who still loves Swetha, leaves for India on the pretense of attending a relative's marriage. He hires a car from Babu Khan, a travel agent, takes a SIM card on his sister's address and stays at Hotel Marriott. Rishi meets Shweta at a restaurant and learns her five-year-old daughter Ria is missing. She laments that no one else, including Karthik, believes that Ria actually exists. Rishi also learns about Karthik's brother Bobby, a drug addict who regularly visits her home. Rishi begins an informal investigation which fails many times, also inviting the ire of two African-American gangsters in the city. Babu, who helps them in transporting drugs, saves Rishi on humanitarian grounds. Posing as Vasanth Khanna, a police officer, Rishi meets Karthik and learns that the couple was childless. Karthik recalls Shweta being attacked by two masked men before a school to steal her car. He added that Shweta went into a coma and post-recovery started claiming that she had a five-year-old daughter named Ria. Perplexed, Rishi later watches a closed-circuit television video footage of the masked men attacking Shweta on the day when Ria went missing. Unfortunately, Ria is seen nowhere in the footage, which makes Rishi doubt Shweta's mental condition. He confronts Shweta, who refuses to acknowledge that Ria is imaginary. Rishi sees height markings of a child on a wall, and before he could react, Shweta commits suicide in his presence. ACP Jaya and Inspector Ravi Chowdary investigate the suicide case. Khanna is killed in Marriott, and Babu confesses to Rishi that he saw Bobby kidnapping Ria. They meet Jaya and Chowdary and get Bobby arrested. In custody, Bobby is killed by Jaya in an act of self-defense. That same night, Khanna's murderers attack Babu and Rishi, and Babu is killed in the process of shooting the murderers to death. Rishi watches a MMS in the murderers' phone sent by Jaya instructing to kill him. Rishi meets Jaya at her farmhouse, where Ria is hidden. Jaya reveals that Karthik wanted to kill Ria and arranged the attack on Shwetha, after which Jaya found Ria in Bobby's custody. After meeting Ria, Jaya conspires to raise the girl as her daughter because she had lost her own husband and unborn daughter in a car accident. Jaya wanted to name her daughter Ria, so when she saw Shwetha's daughter, she convinced herself that her daughter has come back. Thus, Jaya made a deal with Karthik; Karthik wanted Shweta to suffer so according to Jaya's plan, he convinced his friends and family to pretend that Ria never existed, saying Shweta cannot bear the shock of her daughter's death. Before Jaya can kill Rishi, Chowdary shoots her after listening to the conversation on his way to the farmhouse with his subordinates. Karthik is arrested and reveals that Ria is not his daughter, as a medical report confirmed him sterile in the past. Then, Rishi remembers his last meeting with Shweta; she visited him to invite him to her wedding, and they made love. Rishi now realises Ria is his biological child. As he approaches Ria, he sees a reflection of Shweta smiling at him."

Sesh wanted to make a thriller film with the missing of a three-year-old being the backdrop. Prasad V Potluri of PVP Cinema agreed to bankroll the film and Sesh's friend Ravikanth Perepu was chosen to direct the film; it marked the latter's debut in Telugu cinema. Sesh and Perepu worked on the screenplay for ten months. Pre-production phase began three months after the scripting work commenced. Sesh and Perepu chose to work with a low budget to make the project a feasible one, considering the genre's appeal. The film's crew consisted of 20 members; two of Perepu's twelfth grade friends were the associate directors. While writing the script, Sesh and Perepu discussed possibilities for every situation and discarded the first one as it would be a predictable one. Shaneil Deo was the film's director of photography. Sricharan Pakala composed the film's soundtrack and score. Perepu edited the film with Arjun Shastri; Sesh and the associate directors did get involved in the process. Sesh played Rishi, an investment banker who searches for his ex-girlfriend's missing child on her request.

To purchase a unique pop-up book of London in Samuel Gruber's antique shop for his aunt Lucy's 100th birthday, Paddington performs several odd jobs and saves his wages, but the book is stolen. Paddington gives chase, but the thief escapes, and Paddington is framed. The thief returns home and is revealed to be Phoenix Buchanan, an egotistical actor who lives near the Browns. Paddington appears in court, and although Gruber states that he does not believe that Paddington stole the book, with no evidence of the thief's existence, Paddington is convicted and sent to prison. While in prison, Paddington befriends many of the inmates, including the short-tempered chef Knuckles, who recruits Paddington, impressed by his marmalade sandwich recipe. The Browns work to clear Paddington's name, putting up sketches of the thief. Buchanan uses the book to locate a series of clues within London's landmarks, which he believes will unveil the location of a secret treasure. During their efforts to prove Paddington's innocence, the Browns encounter a fortune teller who informs them that the book leads to the hidden fortune of the original author. With Paddington inside, the prison is a much livelier place, but Paddington struggles to remain positive when the Browns are unable to prove his innocence, but keep hunting. Knuckles, Phibs and Spoon later tell Paddington that although the Browns mean well, they will eventually forget about him. Becoming convinced that Buchanan is the culprit, the Browns look for the stolen book inside his house. They find a secret attic where Buchanan's various costumes are stashed, including the costume of the thief. Buchanan returns home and they are forced to leave. Meanwhile, the Browns' investigation causes them to miss visiting Paddington in prison. Paddington, thinking that the Browns have in fact forgotten him, joins Knuckles, Phibs and Spoon in a prison break. They promise to aid in proving his innocence, but after escaping, they promptly abandon the idea in order to leave the country, inviting Paddington to join them. Paddington refuses and, while avoiding the police, uses a public telephone to contact the Browns, who assert that Buchanan is the real culprit. To catch him, they arrange to meet at Paddington Station, where a carnival train carrying the supposed location of the hidden fortune is due to leave. Paddington reaches the station, disguising himself as a litter bin to avoid the police, and boards the train just as it leaves. The Browns pursue on a LNER Peppercorn Class A1, at the opposite platform. Buchanan finds the hidden fortune but is thwarted by Paddington who takes back the book. Henry, Judy and Mrs. Bird catch up and board the other train to confront Buchanan, who overwhelms them and escapes. He severs the coupling of the train's rear carriage (with Paddington locked inside), but is photographed by Judy while holding the book, before Henry knocks him out. Paddington is left stranded in the rear carriage, which crashes into a nearby river. Mary tries to rescue Paddington but struggles to open the locked carriage; she is soon assisted by Knuckles and the other inmates, who had a change of heart and decide to help Paddington as promised. Paddington becomes very ill and falls into a coma, but wakes up on Lucy's birthday. He learns that he has been exonerated, and that Buchanan has been arrested and the book with the hidden fortune on the train are being kept by authorities. He is disappointed that he cannot give Lucy the book, which was taken in as evidence, but soon discovers the Browns, with the help of various other people in the neighbourhood, made sure Lucy could come to London and see it for herself. When answering the door to her, Paddington rushes up and hugs her, wishing her a happy birthday. During the credits, Knuckles, Phibs, and Spoon are pardoned, and Knuckles opens a sandwich business. Buchanan is sentenced to 10 years in prison; six months later, he is shown to be putting his experience as a performer to further use by hosting shows for the inmates and providing entertainment throughout the building."

The film was originally set to be distributed by The Weinstein Company and Dimension Films in the United States through their sub-label, TWC-Dimension, as the last film was. Following the sexual abuse allegations against Weinstein Company founder Harvey Weinstein, Heyday Films and StudioCanal looked for another American distributor for Paddington 2, because they believed that a film for children should not be associated with the Weinstein scandal. In mid-November 2017, Warner Bros. Pictures, which distributed Heyday's Harry Potter films and was already distributing the Paddington films in Spain, acquired the film's North American distribution rights for $32 million (\u00a324 million), making it the first film in the series to do so. Warner Bros. also has the right of first refusal to distribute future Paddington films in North America."

The website's critical consensus reads, \"Paddington 2 honours its star's rich legacy with a sweet-natured sequel whose adorable visuals are matched by a story perfectly balanced between heartwarming family fare and purely enjoyable all-ages adventure.\" On 18 January 2018, it became the most-reviewed film ever to remain at 100% on the site, with 164 positive reviews, beating Toy Story 2, which had 163 positive reviews at the time. Lady Bird had previously beaten the record the past November, but registered a negative review at 196. In 2021, the 100% score for Citizen Kane (1941), often regarded as the greatest film ever made, was changed to 99% following the inclusion of an 80-year-old negative review; some publications satirically labelled Paddington 2 as a better film than Citizen Kane due to their respective scores. In May 2021, Paddington 2 score dropped to 99% after a negative review from 2017 was registered on the site. On Metacritic, another review aggregator, the film has a weighted average score of 88 out of 100 based on 38 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". On French entertainment information publisher AlloCin\u00e9, the film has an average grade of 4.0/5 based on 22 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, the same score earned by its predecessor. Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter wrote,\u00a0\"Paddington 2 won't save the world, sadly, but its existence makes everything just that tiny bit better and more, well, bearable.\" Guy Lodge of Variety wrote, \"Another near pawfect family entertainment, honouring the cosy, can-do spirit of Michael Bond's stories while bringing them smoothly into a bustling, diverse 21st century London\u00a0\u2014 with space for some light anti-Brexit subtext to boot.\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote, \"The film is pitched with insouciant ease and a lightness of touch at both children and adults without any self-conscious shifts in irony or tone: it's humour with the citrus tang of top quality thick-cut marmalade.\" In 2019, The Guardian ranked Paddington 2 the 69th best film of the 21st century."

The Secretary-General of the United Nations recruits the Twelfth Doctor, as President of Earth, to help. The Doctor is still blind (\"Oxygen\"), a secret he is keeping from Bill. The Monks who occupy the pyramid cause every clock in the world to display a time counting down to midnight in the manner of the Doomsday Clock. The Doctor has the military leaders use coordinated attacks on the Monks, as a show of strength, but the Monks easily deflect them. The Doctor, Bill, and Nardole soon join the leaders as they negotiate with the Monks. Using the computer running their simulations (\"Extremis\"), the Monks show that the Earth will become lifeless within a year. They offer humanity their help to stop a pending cataclysmic disaster, but only if they \"consent\". The Doctor warns that this consent would have unknown but everlasting consequences. The Secretary-General offers his consent, but the Monks disintegrate him, saying he gave it out of fear, not \"love\". The Doctor realises the Monks are misdirecting them to believe a military disaster is imminent, and instead suspects the threat is biological. He and Nardole find several laboratories performing bacterial work and briefly override their internal camera systems to determine which one the Monks are watching. Bill stays behind as the Doctor and Nardole travel in the TARDIS to the lab. Through a series of inconsequential events, two scientists have accidentally created a super-bacterium capable of breaking down all living organisms, and it is about to be vented into the atmosphere. The TARDIS arrives, but the Doctor sends Nardole back for his safety, unaware that he has been contaminated. Inside the TARDIS, Nardole collapses unconscious. Meanwhile, Bill, in communication with the Doctor, joins the military leaders as they offer to surrender. The Monks still disintegrate them, considering it a strategic move. The Doctor, with the help of Erica, one of the scientists, crafts a makeshift bomb to sterilise the bacteria and destroy the lab. However, he becomes trapped inside, unable to see a combination lock to free himself, use his sonic screwdriver on it, or get Nardole's assistance. He is forced to admit to Bill he is blind. Bill, representing the Doctor's authority, offers her consent to the Monks, insisting they restore the Doctor's sight. The Monks accept, as this consent came from her love for the Doctor. The Doctor regains his vision and escapes the lab, while the Monks assert their control of Earth."

However, he went on to praise the ending of the episode and how it saved the episode itself, finding the similarities with the second part of the Tenth Doctor serial \"The End of Time\" and how the Doctor managed to save the world, but at a cost. Wilkins commenting on the unexpected ending, stating that it is \"probably what I'm going to remember from \"The Pyramid At The End Of The World,\" especially when thinking of it as the middle entry between the brilliant \"Extremis\" and the seriously intriguing-looking \"The Lie Of The Land.\"\" Kathleen Wiedel of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5 star rating, noting the ambiguous nature of some parts of the episode, and the issues concerning certain elements, such as the promotion of the Doctor to \"President of Earth\" and how this was mostly ignored, and how the necessity for \"consent\" from the Monks was not explained. She went on to praise the number of continuity references in the episode, and Rachel Denning's role as the scientist Erica. Ross Ruediger of the New York Magazine gave the episode a perfect score of 5 out of 5 stars, complimenting the work and scripts of Peter Harness yet again and his repeated themes of \"monumental life and death decisions for humankind\", and also director the Daniel Nettheim and how he \"took two great scripts and made utterly compelling yet very different end products out of each\". Ruediger also commented on how \"politically charged\" the episode was. He also commented on his reservations about how the initial references to terrorism had been removed from the episode due to the Manchester Arena bombing, and while it was \"understandable\", he stated how the sequence posed questions that were relevant to the story. Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times gave the episode a rating of 4 out of 5 stars, describing it as \"a peculiar blend of the deadly serious and hilariously hokum\". He stated that the best part of the episode was the story line of the two researchers and the slow reveal towards deadly disease as the climax of the episode, and how it was reminiscent of Terry Nation's 1970s serial Survivors."

In June 2017, many of the original cast confirmed their involvement, with James being cast in the role of Young Donna that July. Filming took place from August to December 2017 in Croatia (most prominently Vis), Bordeaux, Stockholm, Oxford, Hampton and at Shepperton Studios.

        "content": "In a flashback to 1979, a young Donna Sheridan graduates from Oxford's New College with Rosie and Tanya (\"When I Kissed the Teacher\"), and dreams of a Greek island named Kalokairi. Donna's mother, Ruby, is a famous singer; but she has a strained relationship with her daughter and is consistently away on tour, and does not attend the graduation. Fed up with her mother's constant negligence and determined to spend her life making memories, Donna decided to travel to Kalokairi to find her destiny. In the present, five years after the events of the first film, Sophie is in Kalokairi preparing for the grand reopening of the Hotel Bella Donna, in honour of her recently deceased mother. Harry and Bill are unable to attend due to overseas business ventures and Sophie also feels estranged from her husband, Sky, who's been offered a permanent job in New York (\"One of Us\"). In Paris, Donna meets the sweet but awkward Harry Bright, who instantly falls in love with her (\"Waterloo\"). They spend the night together, but Donna leaves soon after for Greece. She misses her boat to Kalokairi but is offered a ride by Bill Anderson in his yacht, and the two dance and flirt (\"Why Did It Have To Be Me\"). On the way, they help a stranded fisherman, Alexio, back to shore in time to save the love of his life from having to marry another. Unbeknownst to Donna, Harry has followed her to Greece; however, he arrives too late and sadly watches the boat sailing off in the distance. In the present, Rosie and Tanya arrive to support Sophie, and she shows them the new hotel (\"I Have a Dream\"). This mirrors the past, in which Donna explores an abandoned farmhouse that would eventually become the hotel. A heavy storm then breaks out and Donna discovers a trapped horse and soothes it with the assistance of Sam Carmichael. In the present, a heavy storm destroys the decorations and prevents transportation to Kalokairi, much to Sophie's dismay. Sam, who has been living in a cabin on the island, reassures Sophie that she can never let her mother down, telling her the story of how he once let Donna down. Years ago, before Sophie was born, Donna and Sam were enjoying a whirlwind romance (\"The Name of the Game\"), but it ended badly when Donna found out Sam was engaged to another woman, Lorraine. Heartbroken, Donna breaks up with him and tearfully watches him leave the island (\"Knowing Me Knowing You\"), while the present Sam reassures Sophie of her mother's value for her. Following Sam's departure, Donna is visited by Tanya and Rosie, who cheer her up by singing with her as Donna and the Dynamos (\"Mamma Mia\"). Bill returns to the island, and Donna joins him on his boat, much to the chagrin of Rosie who falls for Bill. While they are gone, Sam returns, having ended his engagement for Donna, but is saddened to hear that she is with another man. Donna discovers she is pregnant but has no idea which one of her three recent lovers is the father. Bill's great-aunt Sofia overhears Donna's wish to stay on the island and reveals she owns the abandoned farmhouse Donna has been staying in. Donna happily accepts her offer to stay there, where she eventually gives birth to Sophie. In the present, Sophie opens up to Rosie and Tanya about her conflict with Sky and Rosie explains to Sophie how she and Bill broke up (\"Angel Eyes\"). Meanwhile, Bill, Harry, and Sky leave their ventures abroad to support Sophie but are told there are no boats to Kalokairi. However, a  much older Alexio recognises Bill and offers the trio safe boat passage to the island as gratitude for saving his relationship. Bill convinces the others to join them for a party on Kalokairi. When the guests arrive (\"Dancing Queen\"), Bill and Rosie quickly reunite over their mutual grief over Donna's death, and Sophie reveals to Sky that she is pregnant, and she has never felt closer to her mother. The celebration is suddenly disrupted when Ruby arrives, despite Sophie having decided to not invite her. Ruby explains that Sky tracked her down in New York, and she wants to build a true relationship with her granddaughter. Sophie then performs with the Dynamos in honor of Donna (\"I've Been Waiting for You\"), much to the pride of Ruby, who expresses slight but sincere grief over her daughter's death. It is then revealed that the hotel manager, Se\u00f1or Fernando Cienfuegos, is actually Ruby's long-lost lover from 1959, and the two are joyously reunited (\"Fernando\"). Nine months later, Sophie has given birth to a baby boy, named Donny. At the christening, Donna's spirit proudly watches over her daughter as the two of them have one final moment before Donna fully passes on (\"My Love, My Life\"). The end credits show all the characters, including Donna and the younger cast, at a huge party at Hotel Bella Donna (\"Super Trouper\")."

Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian termed the sequel as \"weirdly irresistible\" and gave it three out of five stars. He described his reaction to the first film as \"a combination of hives and bubonic plague,\" but concedes that this time, the relentlessness and greater self-aware comedy made him smile. He concludes: \"More enjoyable than I thought. But please. Enough now.\" Mark Kermode of The Observer gave the film five stars and commented, \"This slick sequel delivers sharp one-liners, joyously contrived plot twists and an emotional punch that left our critic reeling.\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone awarded the film two and a half stars out of five, noting the absence of Streep for the majority of the film hindered his enjoyment, and saying, \"her absence is deeply felt since the three-time Oscar winner sang and danced her heart out as Donna Sheridan\". Lindsay Bahr of Associated Press awarded the film three out of four stars, calling it \"wholly ridiculous\", but complimenting its self-awareness. She also praised James' performance and singing talent. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the sequel a mixed review, awarding it two stars out of four, criticizing the reprises of \"Dancing Queen\" and \"Super Trouper\" as uninspired, and feeling that some of the musical numbers dragged the pacing. He considered the younger counterparts to the main characters \"energetic\" and \"likeable.\" Stephanie Zacharek of Time gave the film a mixed review, writing \"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again is atrocious. And wonderful. It's all the reasons you should never go to the movies. And all the reasons you should race to get a ticket.\""

Later that evening, Kai insists that Winter and Ally modify the ice cream truck to avoid detection. Winter asks Ally about the circumstances of Ivy's death and wonders if Kai had something to do with it. The incumbent senator whom Kai is challenging in the midterm elections dismisses Kai's campaign on television and Kai resolves to orchestrate a \u201cnight of a thousand Tates\u201d, referring to the infamous Tate murders. He tells the militiamen that on August 9, 1969, Charles Manson's \"family\", including Tex Watson, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Linda Kasabian, killed Sharon Tate and four of her friends at her home in Beverly Hills. Atkins stabbed Tate, who was eight months pregnant, multiple times and wrote the word \u201cpig\u201d in blood on the door to the house. Gary and a few of Kai's followers break into a local Planned Parenthood office. Once inside, Gary is surrounded by Kai and his followers wearing their clown attire and he is stabbed to death. The next morning, a woman who works at the office stumbles across Gary's corpse lying at the front door next to a sign written in his blood that reads \"stop the slaughter\". Beverly reports on the murder while interviewing Kai. Kai suggests in the interview that the incumbent senator is responsible for Gary's murder. When the camera stops filming, Kai chastises Beverly's monotone delivery. At the Butchery, Winter approaches Beverly and apologizes for framing her for Samuels' murder. She then gives Beverly a train ticket to Montana where Winter says she can start a new life and escape from the cult. Beverly tells Winter that she will always be loyal to Kai. Kai begins to suspect that there is a mole in the cult. He runs up to his parents\u2019 bedroom trying to identify the source of a perpetual buzzing sound. He hallucinates Dr. Vincent coming back to life and giving him advice. He then hallucinates Charles Manson stabbing Vincent. Manson tells Kai that he can't trust women. Ally tells Kai that she has found a listening device. The doorbell rings and Kai instructs Ally to stay where she is. Kai answers the door and finds Bebe standing there. They both go to the basement where Bebe tells Kai that he isn't keeping his end of the deal they made a year ago. Bebe pulls a gun on Kai and Ally shoots her in the back of the head. That evening, Winter shaves Kai's head in the bathroom. Kai tells Winter that he feels as though she's slipping away and she tells Kai that every follower of his will leave him one day except for her. Kai tells Winter that he is planning on having her by his side when he is in the White House and they briefly hug each other. Kai then suggests that Winter run away to Montana and pulls out the train ticket she gave to Beverly earlier. In the basement, Kai, convinced that Winter is the mole, demands her to confess. When she denies that she is the mole and refuses to confess, Kai tearfully strangles her to death. Speedwagon runs  to his car afterwards and destroys a wire.

Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5, saying \"While Kai's subversion and Ally's apparent conversion are unexpected, American Horror Story: Cult doesn't quite pull the rug out from under us this week. The recreation of the murders is expertly done, fulfilling the anticipation of the promised gore, but the American horror at the center of the episode is more sad than frightening. If nothing else, this episode convinced me that Butte, Montana, is the scariest place on earth.\" Kat Rosenfield from Entertainment Weekly gave the episode an A-. She particularly praised the scenes with Charles Manson, calling them \"horrifying even by AHS standards\". She also enjoyed Billie Lourd's performance in this episode. However, she noticed that some plot points, like Gary's death, could only be explained by Kai's madness, \"because it otherwise makes absolutely no sense\". Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a 6 out of 10, with a mixed review. He said \"A week out from the finale, Cult revealed that Kai was never the person we'd come to know, even in flashbacks. Instead, he was a bitter woman hater who was most definitely not pretending to be a woman hater for the sake of a twist that could have flipped the show on its ear. With increasing paranoia and drug use, Kai went from a man leading an ambitious and lethal social experiment to... just another unremarkable trolling bigot.\""

Jaffe and his shaman Baba reveal to a baffled Akeem that he had sired a son during his first visit in Queens, New York, after his aide Semmi had enticed two women into spending the night with them while Akeem was still searching for his future queen. One of them inadvertently drugged Akeem, resulting in a tryst he did not remember. As Zamundian tradition demands that only a male successor can inherit the throne, and Akeem has fathered only daughters, Akeem is forced to travel back to Queens to retrieve his son. If not, Zamunda could face a hostile takeover by Zamunda's militaristic neighbor nation Nexdoria, whose dictator, General Izzi (the brother of Imani, Akeem's original arranged bride-to-be), has been pushing for Akeem's eldest daughter Meeka into marrying his foppish son, Idi. Following King Jaffe's funeral and Akeem's ascension to king, he and Semmi travel back to Queens to find his illegitimate son. During a lighthearted reunion with the barbershop gang they bonded with, head barber Mr. Clarence informs them that the son in question is Lavelle Junson, a ticket scalper who hustles outside of Madison Square Garden. After an awkward reunion with Lavelle's mother Mary, Akeem takes them back to Zamunda, much to his family's displeasure. When General Izzi learns of this, he drops by to introduce his daughter Bopoto to Lavelle as a last shot at laying claim to the throne of Zamunda, but in order to qualify as a royal prince, Lavelle first has to pass a series of traditional - and hazardous - tests. Lavelle is at first highly reluctant to place himself in danger, but then bonds with Mirembe, a royal groomer, who tells him of Akeem's quest to find his queen and encourages him to follow his own path. Lavelle then invites his uncle Reem, Mary's streetwise brother, to Zamunda who coaches him on how to blend his urban upbringing with his new royal status. Lavelle gradually develops an understanding with Akeem's family and, using his wits and some forced courage, he passes and is made Prince of Zamunda. However, at his accession party, Lavelle overhears a conversation between Akeem and Izzi which makes him believe that Akeem is just exploiting him, and he, Mirembe, Mary and Reem go back to New York. Upset at losing Mary, whom she has befriended, Lisa locks Akeem out of their bedroom. After a pep talk from his father-in-law Cleo, who reminds him of late Queen Aoleon's progressive mind, Akeem flies back to the States, while Semmi is left to stall Izzi, who intends to return the next day to either see Bopoto marry Lavelle or declare war. Returning to Queens, Akeem finds that Lavelle and Mirembe are about to get married. Confronted by Lavelle and reminded of his own life story, he gives them his blessing and releases Lavelle from his marriage to Bopoto. When Mirembe expresses reluctance in the couple cutting all of their ties to Zamunda, Akeem offers to fly Mary's family back for a proper wedding. In the meantime, Semmi and the princesses, all trained staff fighters, fight off and subdue General Izzi when he invades the palace, forcing him to try a more diplomatic approach. Upon his return home, Akeem changes the royal succession by allowing his daughter Meeka to ascend to the throne upon his death, while Lavelle is made an ambassador to the United States, and General Izzi has opened Nexdoria for a peaceful political and trading relationship. The film concludes with a grand party at the royal palace to celebrate Lavelle and Mirembe's marriage, including the barbers from Queens as special guests and a performance of the song \"We Are Family\" from Sexual Chocolate."

The website's critics consensus reads, \"Decades after its predecessor joked about the fine line between love and nausea, Coming 2 America reminds audiences that there's an equally fine line between sequel and retread.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100 based on 47 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Cassie Da Costa of Vanity Fair reviewed the film unfavorably, writing that it is \"startling in its utter incompetence\" and \"uses half-baked internet-era discourse as a substitute for meaningful or even entertaining cultural commentary\". Writing for The Guardian, critic Peter Bradshaw stated that \"the movie is as tired and middle-aged as Akeem [the leading character] himself\". Peter Debruge of Variety said \"For the most part, Coming 2 America falls back on familiar punchlines, serving up nearly word-for-word repeats of amusing bits from the original, but they don't necessarily play the same in this context.\" Melanie McFarland of Salon gave the film a favorable review, writing that it \"honors its predecessor\" and overcomes some of the original film's datedness, by utilizing \"more equitable comedy that skewers outdated patriarchal traditions.\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised Eddie Murphy's performance, saying, \"When he brings his dramatic capacities to comic roles, he's really at his best and most original. It's strange, these movies that create a warm feeling. It's hard to say why or how it feels like the summation of the three decades of virtuosic silliness that Murphy has brought to the screen, and of all that has meant to us.\" The film garnered controversy due to a scene that depicted a date rape towards an unconscious male in a humorous fashion with many viewers taking to Twitter to protest it."

Seven of those children were adopted by eccentric billionaire Sir Reginald Hargreeves, and turned into a superhero team known as \"The Umbrella Academy\". In the present, five of these children, now grown-up, live separate lives. Luther \"Number 1\" lives on the moon, Diego \"Number 2\" stops a home invasion, Allison \"Number 3\" walks on the red carpet at a film premiere, Klaus \"Number 4\" leaves rehab and immediately begins to use drugs, and Vanya \"Number 7\" plays the violin. After watching the news, they all learn about Sir Reginald Hargreeves's death. The children decide to reunite in their old home, the Academy, to talk about their father's death. Visiting his father's bedroom, Luther begins to suspect that his father was murdered by one of the others, as his monocle is missing. Diego reassures Luther that the coroner stated that Sir Reginald died of heart failure but Luther remains suspicious. In a flashback to the Umbrella Academy's first public appearance, the Academy successfully stop a bank robbery. Sir Reginald and Vanya watch the action from a rooftop, and Vanya asks why she can't help. Sir Reginald tells Vanya that she just isn't special, and later in an interview, he tells the public that he adopted six children, instead of seven. Back in the present, a lightning storm causes the group to go outside. Once there, they watch as a young Five \"Number 5\", one of the siblings, arrives at the Academy through a strange ball of blue energy. Five explains that he traveled to the future, came back, and became stuck in his 13-year-old body, though he's actually a 58-year-old man. Later, the group holds a funeral for Sir Reginald. In a flashback, Sir Reginald trains and monitors all the children. He also gives all of them a tattoo of an umbrella on their wrists, except Vanya, who draws her own umbrella tattoo using a pen. In the present, the group . Five visits a coffee shop, where he kills several men who try to kidnap him. At a river, Diego is revealed to have taken Sir Reginald's monocle, which he dumps in a river. Klaus, who has the ability to talk to dead people, begins to talk with his dead sibling, Ben \"Number 6\". The episode ends with Five visiting Vanya, where he tells her that in eight days the human race will come to an end, but he doesn't know why or how."
