This film is telling a story of a young, village girl who bravely resists old-dated customs and searches for freedom. It was the directorial debut for Chen Kaige. The film's notable cinematography is by Zhang Yimou.  At the 24th Hong Kong Film Awards ceremony on 27 March 2005, a list of 100 Best Chinese Motion Pictures was tallied, and Yellow Earth came in fourth. The film was produced by Guangxi Film Studio (simplified Chinese: \u5e7f\u897f\u7535\u5f71\u5236\u7247\u5382; traditional Chinese: \u5ee3\u897f\u96fb\u5f71\u88fd\u7247\u5ee0; pinyin: Gu\u01cengx\u012b Di\u00e0ny\u01d0ngzh\u00ecpi\u00e0n Ch\u01ceng).\nZhang Yimou, a colleague of Chen, photographed the film. Richard James Havis, author of Changing the Face of Chinese Cinema: An Interview with Chen Kaige, said that the film was the first Chinese film \"at least since the 1949 Communist Liberation, to tell a story through images rather than dialog.\" Therefore, the film attracted controversy in China. Havis added that the film \"was also equivocal about the Communist Party's ability to help the peasants during the Communist revolution\", a position which differed from that espoused by the propaganda films that were produced after 1949.\""

        "content": "Gu Qing, a soldier from the propaganda department of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) Eighth Route Army in CCP-controlled Shaanxi, travels alone from Yan'an to the northern KMT-controlled area of Shaanxi, Shanbei, in the early spring of 1939, with the task of collecting the peasants' folk songs in order to re-write them with communist lyrics in order to boost the morale of the Eighth Route Army soldiers.\nAccording to the academic article Color, Character, and Culture: On \"Yellow Earth, Black Cannon Incident\", and \"Red Sorghum\" by H. C. Li, Yellow Earth begins with a scene depicting a communist soldier walking several miles. He reaches a small village where he is assigned to live with a poor as well as illiterate family with the task of recording local folk songs for use in the propagandized communist cause. The father in the family, an old widower, dislikes Gu's re-telling of social reforms about women receiving education and choosing who they will marry on their own terms within the communist domain in the province's south, but Cuiqiao, his hard-working daughter, happily listens to his tales and is joyful when her younger brother, Hanhan, becomes friends with Gu. Gu learns the hardships of peasant life and especially that of Cuiqiao. The story then focuses on the girl, who at only age 14, is told that she must marry a significantly older man in only a few months' time as her wedding dowry was used to pay for her mother's funeral and brother's engagement. She is even more miserable when Gu informs them that he must return to Yan'an. The next morning, Hanhan accompanies Gu as he leaves and they part ways. However, Cuiqiao is waiting for Gu along the way and she pleads to go along with him. Gu does not know of her forced marriage so he convinces her to go back as she cannot follow without his army's permission, but he will come back for her one day. The wedding day comes and Cuiqiao is taken away in a bridal sedan. On the other hand, Gu has reached Yan'an and is now watching a drum-dance for new recruits fighting for the anti-Japanese war. Cuiqiao informs Hanhan that she wants to run away to join the army and she tells him to take care of their father and give Gu some hand-sewn insoles whenever he comes back. At night, she tries to cross the turbulent Yellow River while singing a song taught by Gu Qing, but whether she makes it across remains unclear.\nFast forward to another summer, Gu returns as he once promised Cuiqiao. But there is no one in the peasant family's home, so he goes into their village and sees countless peasants led by Cuiqiao's father praying and dancing for rain because the land has dried up and peoples' crops have died: \"Dragon King of the Sea, let the good rains fall. Send cool wind and gentle rain to save us all!\" Hanhan spots Gu and tries to go over to him, but a crowd of peasants obstructs his way. The film ends with the sound of Cuiqiao's song: \"The piebald cock flies over the wall. The Communist Party shall save us all!\" (96-97)"

After the two graduated in 1982, they went to work at the same film studio, Guangxi Film Studio. While working at the Guangxi Film Studio, Chen Kaige was the director and Zhang Yimou was the cameraman. The two collaborated on a film called Yellow Earth for artistic pursuits. It is also their only co-production.\nYellow Earth is Chen Kaige's first film, who is an important figure in the Chinese fifth generation cinema history. Together with Zhang Yimou, who is also an icon in the fifth generation, they created a film that \"changed the face of filmmaking in the country\". The chemistry between Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou is well presented in this film because it is marked as a signature work that initiated the fifth generation Chinese cinema. Fifth generation directors create distinctive works because they add political allegories into their films that make them different from conventional and social-realist filmmaking. Unlike other state products, \"their films contain sophisticated reflections on the country's history, culture and its evolution\"."

        "content": "The screenplay for Yellow Earth is based on a novel by Ke Lan, \"Echoes in the Deep Valley\" (Shengu huiyin). The inspiration of the protagonist's, Guqing's, portrayal comes from Ke Lan himself, who was once a young cultural worker from Yan'an on a folksong collection mission. The original novel, cited from an journal, \"reads more like a piece of  adolescent fantasy, is about a unlikely but probable romance between Guqing and Cuiqiao, who committed suicide to defy an arranged marriage.\" However, in the cinematic remake of the novel, there is hardly any inkling of romantic aspiration. The author claims that \"Chen Kaige managed to de-sexualize Ke Lan's original text by casting Gu Qing in his thirties and Cuiqiao as a fourteen-year-old teenager\". Furthermore, Chen Kaige also gives a more positive ending to Cuiqiao, who has managed to defy her fate and escape from the constraints of feudalism."

        "content": "Yellow Earth is a contentious film that put forward some intriguing issues among censors and the local audience upon release. The relationship between this aesthetic work and political discourse is critical because of the film's story background and its release year, where major historical events took place (wars and revolutions). According to scholar Esther Yau, author of \"Yellow Earth\": Western Analysis and a non-Western Text, the film ironically showcases the soldier's failure to bring about any changes, both in material and ideological levels, \"in the face of invincible feudalism and superstition among the masses transgresses socialist literacy standards\". It is thus reflected in this film as a criticism of the patriarchal and feudal ideologies of that Chinese culture. According to Yau, it is a fact that the censors were highly dissatisfied with the film's \"indulgence with poverty and backwardness\", which inserts negative and poor images to the country. Although no official banning takes place, it is still considered sensitive with respect to China's censorship.\nAs a modernist critique of Chinese culture and history, Yellow Earth is a pioneering work made among other Chinese films during the same period, that inspires international intellectuals as well as other Chinese fifth generation filmmakers.  According to Tian Zhuang Zhaung said in 1986,\"If it wasn't for Yellow Earth, then there wouldn't have been the whole debate about film aesthetics...[the film] represents the future of Chinese cinema now.\". It is also true that the addition of Daoist aesthetics added extra layers of meaning to the films that differentiate it from other Communist products during that period, according to scholar Mary Farquhar, author of The \"Hidden\" Gender in Yellow Earth. Another scholar, Stephanie Donald, author of Landscape and Agency Yellow Earth and the Demon Lover, points out that the shots of landscapes in the film play an important role. According to Donald, the landscape provides not just a backdrop for the drama of history, but also a process to rewrite or reinscribe history. He claims that the landscape has a specific meaning to reassert the meaning of China and its history across 50 years of revolutionary control. The depiction of the landscape, ethnic traditions and village lives reveals human conditions. In addition, as stated by Chen Kaige in an interview, Yellow Earth is a symbolic work that highlights the lives of peasants and hints at a \"voice of reform\"."

        "content": "Esther C. M. Yau from Film Quarterly described the film as being a \"significant instance of a non-western alternative in recent narrative film-making\". He compared the cinematography of the film to classical Chinese art, using a limited amount of colors, natural lighting, and a non-perspectival use of filmic space. He also expressed how the film was a radical departure from mainstream styles and narrative filmmaking in China. The film was proposed as an \"avant-gardist\" attempt by young Chinese filmmakers, from the Fifth Generation, taking inspiration from the abstractionist qualities of classical Chinese art. However, the initial reception of it in China was mixed. Although there was no full-scale ban of this film, the censor was dissatisfied with the film's \"indulgence with poverty and backwardness projecting a negative image of the country\". Critics also called the film being opaque and flat, in comparison to other melodramas in China at the time, particularly highlighting the scene when Cui Cao is forced to marry an old stranger. The film was also scrutinized for being ironic in its depiction of revolutionary ideals in comparison to the reality of how the soldiers failed to bring out any material or ideological changes within the story.\nNevertheless, reception of this film outside China was mostly positive, where during its premiere at the 1985 Hong Kong International Festival, it was touted as \"an outstanding breakthrough\", \"expressing deep sentiments poured onto one's national roots\", and \"a bold exploration of film languages\". Richard James Havis, the author of Changing the Face of Chinese Cinema: An Interview with Chen Kaige, said that the film \"immediately brought attention to\" the \"Fifth Generation\" of Chinese filmmakers\". Havis said that the film \"proved a sensation\" at the Hong Kong International Festival. The positive reception of this film outside of China had changed attitudes towards even within China, prompting many locals to support this film through the box office."

        "content": "Pareh (Sundanese for \"rice\"), released internationally as Pareh, Song of the Rice, is a 1936 film from the Dutch East Indies (modern day Indonesia). Directed by the Dutchmen Albert Balink and Mannus Franken, it featured an amateur native cast and starred Raden Mochtar and Soekarsih. The story follows the forbidden love between a fisherman and a farmer's daughter.\nBalink began work on the film in 1934, working with the Wong brothers, who served as cinematographers. They gathered a budget of 75,000 gulden \u2013 several times the budget of other local productions \u2013 and brought Franken from the Netherlands to assist in production. The film was edited in the Netherlands after being shot in the Indies. The film was a commercial and critical success with European audiences, but disliked by native ones; despite this success, Pareh bankrupted its producers.\nPareh resulted in a change in the cinema of Dutch East Indies, which had been Chinese-oriented for several years; films began to make more effort at targeting local audiences.  Balink later found commercial success with Terang Boelan (1937). The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider considers Pareh and Terang Boelan the two most important cinematic works from the Dutch East Indies during the 1930s."

        "content": "During 1934 and early 1935, all feature films released in the Dutch East Indies had been produced by The Teng Chun, based on Chinese mythology or martial arts, and targeted at low-class audiences, generally ethnic Chinese. This situation was created by the Great Depression, which had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes, advertisers asking for more money, and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices; this ensured that there was a very low profit margin for local films. During this period cinemas in the country mainly showed Hollywood productions.\nAlbert Balink, a Dutch journalist, began work on what was to become Pareh in 1934. Unlike The Teng Chun, the inexperienced Balink chose to target his film at Dutch audiences. He brought in two of the Wong brothers, Chinese filmmakers who had been inactive since making Zuster Theresia (Sister Theresa) in 1932. The Wongs donated their studio \u2013 an old tapioca flour factory \u2013 as well as filmmaking equipment. Meanwhile, much of the funding came from other backers. According to the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran, the money came from the cinema mogul Buse, while EYE Film Institute records indicate that the film was backed by the Centrale Commissie voor Emigratie en Kolonisatie van Inheemschen and meant to promote migration from Java to Sumatra.Balink and the Wongs spent most of two years compiling the necessary funds, with Balink in charge of general operations as the head of Java Pacific Film, a joint operation. Balink insisted on perfection and had a clear idea what kind of actor he wanted in the film. Unlike earlier filmmakers in the country, Balink invested time and money in searching for the best locations and actors possible, without considering whether a person was already a celebrity. Ultimately, most of those cast for Pareh had not acted before, including stars Mochtar and Soekarsih.The role of Mahmud was filled when Balink was out with coffee with Joshua and Othniel Wong and saw a young man, tall, strong, and handsome \u2013 as he expected for the role \u2013 driving by. Balink called the Wongs and they got into their car, then chased and caught the young man. The man, Mochtar, a Javanese of noble descent, was told to use the title Raden for the film, which he and his family had already abandoned. According to the Indonesian anthropologist Albertus Budi Susanto, the emphasis on Mochtar's title was meant as a way to draw a higher-class audience.Artistic direction and some of the screenwriting was handled by Mannus Franken, an avant-garde documentary filmmaker from the Netherlands, whom Balink had brought to the Indies. Franken insisted on including ethnographic shots to better present the local culture to international audiences. Franken took an interest in the documentary and ethnographic aspects of the film, directing the shots for these portions, while the Wongs handled the general shots. According to Biran, this was reflected in the camera angles used.Pareh, which had been recorded on 35 mm film using single-system devices, was brought to the Netherlands for editing. There the original voices of the cast were dubbed by actors in the Netherlands, resulting in stilted language use and heavy Dutch accents. Though initially the filmmakers had planned on using gamelan music, the poor quality of the recording equipment in the Indies led to the soundtrack being redone, using European-style music, in the Netherlands. From start to finish the production of Pareh cost 75,000 gulden (approximately US$ 51,000), 20 times as much as a regular local production. After editing there were 2,061 metres of film, equivalent to 92 minutes of runtime."

        "content": "Pareh was screened in the Netherlands as Pareh, een Rijstlied van Java (also noted as Het Lied van de Rijst) beginning on 20 November 1936. The film was also shown in the Indies. It was unable to recoup its costs and bankrupted the producers. The film was critically acclaimed in the Netherlands, partially owing to the emphasis of Franken's involvement. Although it was a commercial success amongst the intelligentsia in the Indies, Pareh was a failure with lower-class native audiences. Mochtar never viewed the film in full.Historical reception of Pareh has generally been positive. Writing in 1955, the Indonesian author and cultural critic Armijn Pane opined that Pareh was technically unparalleled in contemporary Indies cinema, with careful continuity and dynamic cuts. He was critical, however, of the film's tendency to see the Indies' native population through European eyes and depict them as \"primitive\". The American film historian John Lent, writing in 1990, described Pareh as a \"meticulously detailed and costly\" film which attempted to not only earn money, but show the local culture. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider considers Pareh one of the two most important cinematic works from the Dutch East Indies during the 1930s; Balink's later work Terang Boelan (Full Moon; 1937) was the other. Heider, John H. McGlynn, and Salim Said note that the film was of acceptable technical quality but is best remembered for changing the path of cinematic developments in the country."

The Teng Chun, who \u2013 together with Balink \u2013 continued to be the only active filmmaker in the country until 1937, began focusing on more modern stories and those which would be popular with native audiences. Biran suggests that this was influenced by Pareh. Other filmmakers in the late 1930s, partially inspired by Pareh, began to improve the quality of the audio in their films. Pane notes that, following Pareh, films produced domestically no longer centred around ethnic European casts.Mochtar and Soekarsih, who first met on the set of Pareh, married after appearing together in Terang Boelan. This later production included much of the same cast and was highly successful, leading to a renewed interest in filmmaking in the Indies. Terang Boelan proved to be the most successful local production until 1953's Krisis (Crisis), released after Indonesia had become independent."

Kaufman also appears as the eponymous Man of the film.\nVertov's feature film, produced by the film studio All-Ukrainian Photo Cinema Administration (VUFKU), presents urban life in Moscow, Kyiv and Odesa during the late-1920s. It has no actors. From dawn to dusk Soviet citizens are shown at work and at play, and interacting with the machinery of modern life. To the extent that it can be said to have \"characters\", they are the cameramen of the title, the film editor, and the modern Soviet Union they discover and present in the film.\nMan with a Movie Camera is famous for the range of cinematic techniques Vertov invented, employed or developed, such as multiple exposure, fast motion, slow motion, freeze frames, match cuts, jump cuts, split screens, Dutch angles, extreme close-ups, tracking shots, reversed footage, stop motion animations and self-reflexive visuals (at one point it features a split-screen tracking shot; the sides have opposite Dutch angles).\nMan with a Movie Camera was largely dismissed upon its initial release; the work's fast cutting, self-reflexivity, and emphasis on form over content were all subjects of criticism. In the British Film Institute's 2012 Sight & Sound poll, however, film critics voted it the 8th greatest film ever made, the 9th greatest in the 2022 poll, and in 2014 it was named the best documentary of all time in the same magazine. The National Oleksandr Dovzhenko Film Centre placed it in 2021 at number three of their list of the 100 best films in the history of Ukrainian cinema.In 2015, the film received a restoration using a 35mm print of the only known complete cut of the film. Restoration efforts were conducted by the EYE Film Institute in Amsterdam, with additional digital work by Lobster Films. While the film is in the public domain, this restored version was licensed to Flicker Alley for release on Blu-ray."

Each part begins with a number appearing on screen and falling down flat. The film makes use of many editing techniques, such as superimposition, slow motion, fast motion, rapid cross-cutting, and montage.\nThe film has an unabashedly avant-garde style, and the subject matter varies greatly. The titular man with the movie camera (Mikhail Kaufman, Vertov's brother) travels to diverse locations to capture a variety of shots. He appears in artistic images such as a superimposed shot of the cameraman setting up his camera atop a second, mountainous camera, and another superimposed shot of the cameraman inside a beer glass. General images include laborers at work, sporting events, couples getting married and divorced, a woman giving birth, and a funeral procession. Much of the film is concerned with people of varying economic classes navigating urban environments. On occasion, the film's editor (Svilova) is shown working with strips of film and various pieces of editing equipment.\nDespite claiming to be without actors, the film features a few staged situations. This includes some of the cameraman's actions, the scene of a woman getting dressed, and chess pieces being swept to the center of the board (a shot spliced in backwards so the pieces expand outward and stand in position). Stop-motion is used for several shots, including an unmanned camera on a tripod standing up, showing off its mechanical parts, and then walking off screen."

        "content": "Vertov was an early pioneer in documentary film-making during the late 1920s. He belonged to a movement of filmmakers known as the kinoks, or kino-oki (kino-eyes). Vertov, along with other kino artists declared it their mission to abolish all non-documentary styles of film-making, a radical approach to movie making. Most of Vertov's films were highly controversial, and the kinok movement was despised by many filmmakers.\nVertov's crowning achievement, Man with a Movie Camera, was his response to critics who rejected his previous film, A Sixth Part of the World. Critics had declared that Vertov's overuse of \"intertitles\" was inconsistent with the film-making style to which the \"kinoks\" subscribed. Working within that context, Vertov dealt with a lot of fear in anticipation of the film's release. He requested a warning to be printed in the Soviet central Communist newspaper Pravda, which spoke directly of the film's experimental, controversial nature. Vertov was worried that the film would be either destroyed or ignored by the public. Upon the official release of Man with a Movie Camera, Vertov issued a statement at the beginning of the film, which read:\n\nThe film Man with a Movie Camera represents\nAN EXPERIMENTATION IN THE CINEMATIC COMMUNICATION\nOf visual phenomena\nWITHOUT THE USE OF INTERTITLES\n(a film without intertitles)\nWITHOUT THE HELP OF A SCENARIO\n(a film without a scenario)\nWITHOUT THE HELP OF THEATRE\n(a film without actors, without sets, etc.)\nThis new experimentation work by Kino-Eye is directed towards the creation of an authentically international absolute language of cinema on the basis of its complete separation from the language of theatre and literature.\n\nThis manifesto echoes an earlier one that Vertov wrote in 1922, in which he disavowed popular films he felt were indebted to literature and theater."

        "content": "Working within a Marxist ideology, Vertov strove to create a futuristic city that would serve as a commentary on existing ideals in the Soviet world. This artificial city's purpose was to awaken the Soviet citizen through truth and to ultimately bring about understanding and action. The kino's aesthetic shone through in his portrayal of electrification, industrialization, and the achievements of workers through hard labor. This film is in keeping with modernist thoughts in how it challenges art both conceptually and in practice, incorporating industrial life and technology as featured subjects of the film and implementing new editing techniques. In utilizing these techniques, the artist creates a modern interpretation of city life. Some have mistakenly stated that many visual ideas, such as the quick editing, the close-ups of machinery, the store window displays, even the shots of a typewriter keyboard are borrowed from Walter Ruttmann's Berlin: Symphony of a Great City (1927), which predates Man with a Movie Camera by two years, but as Vertov wrote to the German press in 1929, these techniques and images had been developed and employed by him in his Kino-Pravda newsreels and documentaries during the previous ten years, all of which predate Berlin. Vertov's pioneering cinematic concepts actually inspired other abstract films by Ruttmann and others, including writer, translator, filmmaker and critic Liu Na'ou (1905\u20131940), whose The Man Who Has a Camera (1933) pays explicit homage to Vertov's Man with a Movie Camera.Man with a Movie Camera's usage of double exposure and seemingly \"hidden\" cameras made the movie come across as a surreal montage rather than a linear motion picture. Many of the scenes in the film contain people, which change size or appear underneath other objects (double exposure). Because of these aspects, the movie is fast-moving. The sequences and close-ups capture emotional qualities that could not be fully portrayed through the use of words. The film's lack of \"actors\" and \"sets\" makes for a unique view of the everyday world; one that, according to a title card, is directed toward the creation of a new cinematic language that is \"[separated] from the language of theatre and literature\"."

The surgeon intends to amputate Dunbar's leg; choosing death in battle instead, he takes a horse and rides up to and along the Confederate lines. Confederate forces fire repeatedly at him and miss, and the Union Army takes advantage of the distraction to mount a successful attack. Dunbar receives both a citation for bravery and medical care that allows him to keep his leg. He is subsequently awarded Cisco, the horse that carried him during his suicide attempt, and his choice of posting. Dunbar requests a transfer to the western frontier, so he can see it before it disappears.\nDunbar is transferred to Fort Hays, a large fort commanded by Major Fambrough, who appears to despise Dunbar's enthusiasm.  Making sardonic references to Dunbar as a knight-errant, he assigns Dunbar to the furthest outpost under Fambrough's jurisdiction, Fort Sedgwick. With cryptic utterances, the major raises a glass to Dunbar's befuddled exit. Unbeknownst to Dunbar, Fambrough, who is mentally ill and has been issuing arbitrary orders with no records kept, kills himself as Dunbar is departing the fort. Dunbar travels with Timmons, a mule-wagon provisioner. They arrive to find the fort deserted. Despite the threat of nearby native tribes, Dunbar elects to stay and man the post himself.\nHe begins rebuilding and restocking the fort, preferring the solitude, recording many of his observations in his diary. Timmons is killed by Pawnee on the journey back to Fort Hays. The deaths of both Timmons and Fambrough leave the army unaware of Dunbar's assignment, and no other soldiers arrive to reinforce the post.\nDunbar encounters his Sioux neighbors when they attempt to steal his horse and intimidate him. Deciding that being a target is a poor prospect, he seeks out the Sioux camp and attempts dialogue. On his way, he comes across Stands with a Fist. Captured from her white family, she was adopted and assimilated as the daughter of the tribe's medicine man, Kicking Bird. She is ritually mutilating herself in mourning for her late Sioux husband. Dunbar brings her back to the Sioux to recover. Though the tribe is initially hostile, some of the members soon begin to respect him.\nDunbar gradually establishes a rapport with Kicking Bird, the warrior Wind in His Hair, and the youth Smiles a Lot, initially visiting each other's camps. The language barrier frustrates them, and Stands with a Fist acts as an interpreter, although with difficulty. She only remembers a little English from her early childhood before the rest of her family was killed during a Pawnee raid.\nDunbar discovers that the stories he had heard about the tribe were untrue, and he develops a growing respect and appreciation for their lifestyle and culture. Learning their language, he is accepted as an honored guest by the Sioux after he tells them of a migrating herd of buffalo and participates in the hunt. When at Fort Sedgwick, Dunbar befriends a wolf he dubs \"Two Socks\" for its white forepaws. Observing Dunbar and Two Socks chasing each other, the Sioux give him the name \"Dances with Wolves\". During this time, Dunbar also forges a romantic relationship with Stands with a Fist and supplies the tribe with firearms to help defend the village from an attack by the rival Pawnee tribe. Dunbar eventually wins Kicking Bird's approval to marry Stands with a Fist and abandons Fort Sedgwick.\nBecause of the growing threat from the Pawnee and the U.S., Chief Ten Bears decides to move the tribe to its winter camp. Dunbar decides to accompany them, but must first retrieve his diary from Fort Sedgwick, as he realizes that it would provide the army with the means to find the tribe. When he arrives, he finds the fort reoccupied by the U.S. Army. Because of his Sioux clothing, the soldiers open fire, killing Cisco and capturing Dunbar, arresting him as a traitor.\nTwo officers interrogate him, but Dunbar cannot prove his story, as an illiterate corporal has found his diary and kept it to use as toilet paper. Having refused to serve as an interpreter to the tribes, Dunbar is charged with desertion and transported back east as a prisoner. Soldiers of the escort shoot Two Socks when the wolf attempts to follow Dunbar, despite Dunbar's attempts to intervene.\nEventually, the Sioux track the convoy, killing the soldiers and freeing Dunbar. They assert that they do not see him as a white man, but as a Sioux warrior called Dances with Wolves. At the winter camp, Dunbar decides to leave with Stands with a Fist because his continuing presence would endanger the tribe. As they leave, Smiles a Lot returns the diary, which he recovered during Dunbar's liberation, and Wind in His Hair shouts to Dunbar, reminding him that he is Dunbar's friend, a contrast to their original meeting where he shouted at Dunbar in hostility.\nU.S. troops are seen searching the mountains, but cannot locate Dunbar or the tribe. The epilogue reads: \"Thirteen years later\u2014their homes destroyed, their buffalo gone\u2014the last band of free Sioux submitted to white authority at Fort Robinson, Nebraska. The great horse culture of the plains was gone, and the American frontier was soon to pass into history.\""

        "content": "Originally written as a speculative script by Michael Blake, it went unsold in the mid-1980s. However, Kevin Costner had starred in Blake's only previous film, Stacy's Knights (1983) and encouraged Blake in early 1986 to turn the Western screenplay into a novel to improve its chances of being produced. The novel was rejected by numerous publishers, but finally was published in paperback in 1988. The rights were purchased by Costner, with an eye on directing it.Costner and his producing partner, Jim Wilson, had difficulty in raising money for the film. The project was turned down by several studios due to the Western genre no longer being popular, following the disastrous box office of Heaven's Gate (1980), as well as the length of the script. After the project languished at both Nelson Entertainment and Island Pictures due to budget reasons, Costner and Wilson enlisted producer Jake Eberts to manage foreign rights in several countries for Costner to retain final cut rights. The two then made a deal with Orion Pictures, in which the studio would distribute the film in North America.Actual production lasted from July 17 or 18 to November 21 or 23, 1989. Most of the movie was filmed on location in South Dakota, mainly on private ranches near Pierre and Rapid City, with a few scenes filmed in Wyoming. Specific locations included the Badlands National Park, the Black Hills, the Sage Creek Wilderness Area, and the Belle Fourche River area. The bison hunt scenes were filmed at the Triple U Buffalo Ranch outside Fort Pierre, South Dakota, as were the Fort Sedgewick scenes on a custom set."

As of 7 December 2023, the film holds an approval rating of 87% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 131 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"Dances with Wolves suffers from a simplistic view of the culture it attempts to honor, but the end result remains a stirring western whose noble intentions are often matched by its epic grandeur.\" Metacritic gave the film a score of 72 out of 100 based on 20 critical reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade.Dances with Wolves was named one of the top ten films of 1990 by over 115 critics and was named the best film of the year by 19 critics.Because of the film's popularity and lasting impact on the image of Native Americans, members of the Lakota Sioux Nation held a ceremony in Washington, D.C., \"to honor Kevin [Costner] and Mary [McDonnell] and Jim [Wilson] on behalf of the Indian Lakota nation\", explained Floyd Westerman (who plays Chief Ten Bears in the movie). Albert Whitehat, a Lakota elder who served as a cultural adviser on the film, adopted Costner into his family, and two other families adopted McDonnell and Wilson. Westerman continued, that this is so \"They will all become part of one family.\" At the 63rd Academy Awards ceremony in 1991, Dances with Wolves earned 12 Academy Award nominations and won seven, including Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay (Michael Blake), Best Director (Costner), and Best Picture. In 2007, the Library of Congress selected Dances with Wolves for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.Some of the criticism of the film centered on the lack of authenticity of the Lakota language used in the film, as only one of the actors was a native speaker of the language. Oglala Lakota activist and actor Russell Means was critical of the film's lack of accuracy. In 2009, he said, \"Remember Lawrence of Arabia? That was Lawrence of the Plains. The odd thing about making that movie is that they had a woman teaching the actors the Lakota language, but Lakota has a male-gendered language and a female-gendered language. Some of the Natives and Kevin Costner were speaking in the feminine way. When I went to see it with a bunch of Lakota guys, we were laughing.\"Michael Smith (Sioux), the director of San Francisco's long-running annual American Indian Film Festival, said that despite criticisms, \"There's a lot of good feeling about the film in the Native community, especially among the tribes. I think it's going to be very hard to top this one.\" However, Blackfeet filmmaker George Budreau countered, \"I want to say, 'how nice',... But no matter how sensitive and wonderful this movie is, you have to ask who's telling the story. It's certainly not an Indian.\"Though promoted as a breakthrough in its use of an indigenous language, earlier English-language films, such as Eskimo (1933), Wagon Master (1950), and The White Dawn (1974) also have native dialogue.David Sirota of Salon referred to Dances with Wolves as a \"white savior\" film, as Dunbar \"fully embeds himself in the Sioux tribe and quickly becomes its primary protector\". He argued that its use of the \"noble savage\" character type \"preemptively blunts criticism of the underlying White Savior story\"."

        "content": "Judith A. Boughter wrote: \"The problem with Costner's approach is that all of the Sioux are heroic, while the Pawnees are portrayed as stereotypical villains. Most accounts of Sioux\u2013Pawnee relations see the Pawnees, numbering only 4,000 at that time, as victims of the more powerful Sioux.\"The history and context of Fort Hays is radically different from that portrayed in the movie.  Historic Fort Hays was founded in 1867, with the iconic stone blockhouse being built immediately. Its predecessor, Fort Fletcher (1865\u20131868), was abandoned for a few months and then relocated a short distance away in 1866. Fort Hays was founded in Cheyenne territory rather than Sioux. Rather than a desolate site, the fort was host to thousands of soldiers, railroad workers, and settlers from the start. The Kansas Pacific Railway and the settlements of Rome and Hays City were built next to the fort in 1867; each was a perceived violation of Cheyenne and Arapaho territory, resulting in immediate warfare with the Dog Soldiers. The fort was Sheridan's headquarters at the center of the 1867\u20131868 conflict. A historic seasonal Pawnee tipi village had been located only 9 miles (14 km) from Fort Hays, but the Pawnee had been excluded from it by other dominant tribes for some time by the 1860s.A Christian missionary named John Dunbar worked among the Pawnee in the 1830s and 1840s, and sided with the Native Americans in a dispute with government farmers and a local Indian agent. According to screenwriter Michael Blake, the film character's name was chosen at random from lists of Civil War veterans and was merely coincidence.The fictional Lieutenant John Dunbar of 1863 is correctly shown in the film wearing a gold bar on his officer shoulder straps, indicating his rank as a first lieutenant. From 1836 to 1872, the rank of first lieutenant was indicated by a gold bar; after 1872, the rank was indicated by a silver bar. Similarly, Captain Cargill is correctly depicted wearing a pair of gold bars, indicating the rank of captain at that time.Author and screenwriter Michael Blake said that Stands with a Fist was actually based upon Cynthia Ann Parker, the white girl captured by Comanches and mother of Quanah Parker."

        "content": "One year after the original theatrical release of Dances with Wolves, a four-hour version of the film opened at select theaters in London. This longer cut was titled Dances with Wolves: The Special Edition, and it restored nearly an hour's worth of scenes that had been removed to keep the original film's running time under three hours. In a letter to British film reviewers, Kevin Costner and producer Jim Wilson addressed their reasons for presenting a longer version of the film:\n\nWhy add another hour to a film that by most standards pushes the time limit of conventional movie making? The 52 additional minutes that represent this \"new\" version were difficult to cut in the first place, and ... the opportunity to introduce them to audiences is compelling.\nWe have received countless letters from people worldwide asking when or if a sequel would be made, so it seemed like a logical step to enhance our film with existing footage ... making an extended version is by no means to imply that the original Dances with Wolves was unfinished or incomplete; rather, it creates an opportunity for those who fell in love with the characters and the spectacle of the film to experience more of both.\nThe genesis of the four-hour version of the film was further explained in an article for Entertainment Weekly that appeared ten months after the premiere of the original film. \"While the small screen has come to serve as a second chance for filmmakers who can't seem to let their babies go, Kevin Costner and his producing partner, Jim Wilson, hope that their newly completed version will hit theater screens first.\"\n\n\"I spent seven months working on it\", Wilson says of the expanded Wolves. He's quick to defend the Oscar-winning version as \"the best picture we had in us at the time\", yet Wilson also says he's \"ecstatic\" over the recut. \"It's a brand-new picture\", he insists. \"There's now more of a relationship between Kevin and Stands with a Fist, more with the wolf, more with the Indians\u2014stuff that's integral all through the story.\"\nOf course, exhibitors may not want a longer version of an already widely seen movie, but Wilson remains optimistic. \"I don't think the time is now\", he acknowledges, \"but ideally, there is a point at which it would come out with an intermission, booked into the very best venues in America.\"\nCostner later stated that he did not work on the creation of the Special Edition at all."

During a chance meeting with Bittu, Ravi reveals his intention of making quick money by betting on an IPL match and discloses the location of the betting ring. However, the police raid the location, and Ravi is apprehended. During interrogation, Ravi deduces that Bittu has tipped off the cops to commit a crime and convinces ACP Raja Manikyam.

It is an adaptation of Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's 1929 Bengali novel of the same name and features  Subir Banerjee, Kanu Banerjee, Karuna Banerjee, Uma Dasgupta, Pinaki Sengupta and Chunibala Devi in major roles. The first film in The Apu Trilogy, Pather Panchali depicts the childhood travails of the protagonist Apu and his elder sister Durga  amidst the harsh village life of their poor family.\nThe film was shot mainly on location, had a limited budget, featured mostly amateur actors, and was made by an inexperienced crew. Lack of funds led to frequent interruptions in production which took nearly three years. The sitar player Ravi Shankar composed the film's soundtrack and score using classical Indian ragas. Subrata Mitra was in charge of the cinematography while editing was handled by Dulal Dutta. Following its premiere on 3 May 1955 during an exhibition at New York's Museum of Modern Art, Pather Panchali was released in Calcutta the same year to an enthusiastic reception. A special screening was attended by the Chief Minister of West Bengal and the Prime Minister of India. \nCritics have praised its realism, humanity, and soul-stirring qualities, while others have called its slow pace a drawback, and some have condemned it for romanticising poverty. Scholars have commented on the film's lyrical quality and realism (influenced by Italian neorealism), its portrayal of the poverty and small delights of daily life, and the use of what the author Darius Cooper has termed the \"epiphany of wonder\", among other themes.\nThe tale of Apu's life is continued in the two subsequent installments of Ray's trilogy: Aparajito (The Unvanquished, 1956) and Apur Sansar (The World of Apu, 1959). Pather Panchali is described as a turning point in Indian cinema, as it was among the films that pioneered the Parallel cinema movement, which espoused authenticity and social realism. The first film from independent India to attract major international critical attention, it won India's National Film Award for Best Feature Film in 1955, the Best Human Document award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival, and several other awards, establishing Ray as one of the country's most distinguished filmmakers. It is often featured in lists of the greatest films ever made."

His wife Sarbajaya cares for their children, Durga and Apu, and Harihar's elderly cousin, Indir Thakrun. Because of their limited resources, Sarbajaya resents having to share her home with the old Indir, who often steals food from their already bare kitchen. Durga is fond of Indir and often gives her fruit stolen from a wealthy neighbour's orchard. One day, the neighbour's wife accuses Durga of stealing a bead necklace (which Durga denies) and blames Sarbajaya for encouraging her tendency to steal.\nAs the elder sibling, Durga cares for Apu with motherly affection but spares no opportunity to tease him. Together, they share life's simple joys: sitting quietly under a tree, viewing pictures in a travelling vendor's bioscope, running after the candy man who passes through, and watching a jatra (folk theatre) performed by an acting troupe. Every evening, they are delighted by the sound of a distant train's whistle.\nSarbajaya's grows increasingly resentful of Indir and becomes more openly hostile, which causes Indir to take temporary refuge in the home of another relative. One day, while Durga and Apu run to catch a glimpse of the train, Indir\u2014who is feeling unwell\u2014goes back home, and the children find she has passed away upon their return.\nWith prospects drying up in the village, Harihar travels to the city to seek a better job. He promises that he will return with money to repair their dilapidated house, but is gone longer than expected. During his absence, the family sinks deeper into poverty, and Sarbajaya grows increasingly desperate and anxious. One day during the monsoon season, Durga plays in the downpour, catches a cold and develops a high fever. Her condition worsens as a thunderstorm batters the crumbling house with rain and wind, and she dies the next morning.\nHarihar returns home and starts to show Sarbajaya the merchandise he has brought from the city. A silent Sarbajaya breaks down at her husband's feet, and Harihar cries out in grief as he discovers that Durga has died. The family decide to leave their ancestral home for Benaras. As they pack, Apu finds the necklace Durga had earlier denied stealing; he throws it into a pond. Apu and his parents leave the village on an ox-cart, while a snake is seen slithering into their, now barren, house."

        "content": "The realist narrative style of Pather Panchali was influenced by Italian neorealism and the works of French director Jean Renoir. In 1949 Renoir came to Calcutta to shoot his film The River (1951). Ray, a founding member of the Calcutta Film Society (established in 1947), helped him scout for locations in the countryside. When Ray told him about his longstanding wish to film Pather Panchali, Renoir encouraged him to proceed. In 1950 Ray was sent to London by his employer, the advertising agency D.J. Keymer, to work at their headquarters. During his six months in London, he watched about 100 films. Among these, Vittorio De Sica's neorealist film Bicycle Thieves (1948) had a profound impact on him. In a 1982 lecture, Ray said that he had come out of the theatre determined to become a filmmaker. The film made him believe that it was possible to make realistic cinema that was shot on location with an amateur cast.The international success of Akira Kurosawa's Japanese film Rashomon (1950) and Bimal Roy's 1953 Hindi film Do Bigha Zamin (which was shot partly on location and was about a peasant family) led Ray to believe that Pather Panchali would find an international audience. Ray also had more indigenous influences, such as Bengali literature and the native Indian theatrical tradition, particularly the rasa theory of classical Sanskrit drama. Darius Cooper describes the complicated doctrine of rasa as \"center[ed] predominantly on feelings experienced not only by the characters but also conveyed in a certain artistic way to the spectator\"."

        "content": "The soundtrack of the film was composed by the sitar player Ravi Shankar, who was at an early stage of his career, having debuted in 1939. The background scores feature pieces based on several ragas of Indian classical music, played mostly on the sitar. The soundtrack, described in a 1995 issue of The Village Voice as \"at once plaintive and exhilarating\", is featured in The Guardian's 2007 list of 50 greatest film soundtracks. It has also been cited as an influence on The Beatles, specifically George Harrison.Shankar saw about half the film in a roughly edited version before composing the background score, but he was already familiar with the story. According to Robinson, when Ray met Shankar the latter hummed a tune that was folk-based but had \"a certain sophistication\". This tune, usually played on a bamboo flute, became the main theme for the film. The majority of the score was composed within the duration of a single night, in a session that lasted for about eleven hours. Shankar also composed two solo sitar pieces\u2014one based on the raga Desh (traditionally associated with rain), and one sombre piece based on the raga Todi. He created a piece based on the raga Patdeep, played on the tar shehnai, by Dakshina Mohan Tagore to accompany the scene in which Harihar learns of Durga's death. The film's cinematographer, Subrata Mitra, performed on the sitar for parts of the soundtrack."

The film, billed as The Story of Apu and Durga, lacked subtitles. It was one of a series of six evening performances at MoMA, including the US debut of sarod player Ali Akbar Khan and the classical dancer Shanta Rao. Pather Panchali's MoMA opening on 3 May was well received. A film still of Apu having his hair brushed by his sister Durga and mother Sarbojaya was featured in The Family of Man, a 1955 MoMA exhibition.\nPather Panchali had its domestic premiere at the annual meeting of the Advertising Club of Calcutta; the response there was not positive, and Ray felt \"extremely discouraged\". Before its theatrical release in Calcutta, Ray designed large posters, including a neon sign showing Apu and Durga running, which was strategically placed in a busy location in the city. Pather Panchali was released in Basusree, a Calcutta cinema on 26 August 1955 and received a poor initial response. The screenings started filling up within a week or two, buoyed by word of mouth. It opened again at another cinema, where it ran for seven weeks. A delay in subtitling led to the postponement of the UK release until December 1957. It went on to achieve great success in the US in 1958, running for eight months at the Fifth Avenue Playhouse in New York. It was a record run for the Fifth Avenue cinema. The Bengali government earned a profit of $50,000 from its initial US release, and decades later the film grossed $402,723 from its 2015 limited release. The film reportedly grossed an estimated total of \u20b9100 million ($21 million) at the worldwide box office, as of 2017.In India the film's reception was enthusiastic. The Times of India wrote: \"It is absurd to compare it with any other Indian cinema... Pather Panchali is pure cinema\". Chief Minister Roy arranged a special screening in Calcutta for Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who came out of the theatre impressed. Despite opposition from some within the governments of West Bengal and India because of its depiction of poverty, Pather Panchali was sent to the 1956 Cannes Film Festival with Nehru's personal approval. It was screened towards the end of the festival, coinciding with a party given by the Japanese delegation, and only a small number of critics attended. Although some were initially unenthusiastic at the prospect of yet another Indian melodrama, the film critic Arturo Lanocita found \"the magic horse of poetry... invading the screen\". Pather Panchali was subsequently named Best Human Document at the festival.Lindsay Anderson commented after the Cannes screening that Pather Panchali had \"the quality of ultimate unforgettable experience\". In subsequent years, critics have given positive reviews. A 1958 review in Time described Pather Panchali as \"perhaps the finest piece of filmed folklore since Robert Flaherty's Nanook of the North\". In her 1982 book 5001 Nights at the Movies, Pauline Kael wrote: \"Beautiful, sometimes funny, and full of love, it brought a new vision of India to the screen\". Basil Wright considered it \"a new and incontrovertible work of art\". James Berardinelli wrote in 1996 that the film \"touches the souls and minds of viewers, transcending cultural and linguistic barriers\". In 2006 Philip French of The Observer called it \"one of the greatest pictures ever made\". Twenty years after the release of Pather Panchali, Akira Kurosawa summarised the effect of the film as overwhelming and lauded its ability \"to stir up deep passions\".The reaction was not uniformly positive. On seeing the film, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut is reported to have said: \"I don't want to see a movie of peasants eating with their hands\". Bosley Crowther, the most influential critic of The New York Times, wrote in 1958, \"any picture as loose in structure or as listless in tempo as this one is would barely pass as a 'rough cut' with the editors in Hollywood\", even though he praised its gradually emerging poignancy and poetic quality. The Harvard Crimson argued in 1959 that its fragmentary nature \"contributes to the film's great weakness: its general diffuseness, its inability to command sustained attention. For Pather Panchali, remarkable as it may be, is something of a chore to sit through\". Early in the 1980s, Ray was criticised by Nargis Dutt, an Indian parliamentarian and former actress, for \"exporting poverty\". Darius Cooper writes that while many critics celebrated the Apu trilogy \"as a eulogy of third-world culture, others criticized it for what they took to be its romanticization of such a culture\". Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic wrote that \"its story is simple almost to the point of banality, it is rewarding if taken as a dramatized documentary\".As of May 2021, the film has a 97% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on an aggregate of 69 reviews with an average score of 9.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"A film that requires and rewards patience in equal measure, Pather Panchali finds director Satyajit Ray delivering a classic with his debut\". In 2018 the film earned the 15th spot when BBC released the top 100 foreign language films ever, and filmmaker Christopher Nolan called it \"one of the best films ever made\"."

In his 1958 New York Times review, Crowther writes that Pather Panchali delicately illustrates how \"poverty does not always nullify love\" and how even very poor people can enjoy the little pleasures of their world. Marie Seton describes how the film intersperses the depiction of poverty and the delights and pleasures of youth. She represents the bond between Durga and Indir, and their fate, as signifying a philosophical core: that both the young and the old die. Seton writes of the film's \"lyrical\" qualities, noting especially the imagery immediately before the onset of monsoon. Robinson writes about a peculiar quality of \"lyrical happiness\" in the film, and states that Pather Panchali is \"about unsophisticated people shot through with great sophistication, and without a trace of condescension or inflated sentiment\".\nDarius Cooper discusses the use of different rasa in the film, observing Apu's repeated \"epiphany of wonder\", brought about not only by what the boy sees around him, but also when he uses his imagination to create another world. For Cooper, the immersive experience of the film corresponds to this epiphany of wonder. Stephen Teo uses the scene in which Apu and Durga discover railway tracks as an example of the gradual build-up of epiphany and the resulting immersive experience.Sharmishtha Gooptu discusses the idea that the idyllic village life portrayed in Pather Panchali represents authentic Bengali village life, which disappeared during the upheavals of Partition in 1947. She suggests that the film seeks to connect an idealised, pre-partition past with the actual present of partitioned Bengal, and that it uses prototypes of rural Bengal to construct an image of the ideal village. In contrast to this idealism, Mitali Pati and Suranjan Ganguly point out how Ray used eye-level shots, natural lighting, long takes and other techniques to achieve realism. Mainak Biswas has written that Pather Panchali comes very close to the concept of Italian neorealism, as it has several passages with no dramatic development, even though the usual realities of life, such as the changing of seasons or the passing of a day, are concretely filmed."

Together, the three films constitute the Apu trilogy. Aparajito portrays the adolescent Apu, his education in a rural school and a Calcutta college. Its central theme is the poignant relationship between a doting mother and her ambitious young son. Apur Sansar depicts Apu's adult life, his reaction to his wife's premature death, and his final bonding with his son whom he abandoned as an infant. The sequels also won many national and international awards. Ray did not initially plan to make a trilogy: he decided to make the third film only after being asked about the possibility of a trilogy at the 1957 Venice Film Festival, where Aparajito won the Golden Lion. Apur Panchali (2014) is a Bengali film directed by Kaushik Ganguly, which depicts the real-life story of Subir Bannerjee, the actor who portrayed Apu in Pather Panchali. Aparajito, a 2022 Bengali film directed by Anik Dutta, tells the story of the making of Pather Panchali.\nPather Panchali was the first film made in independent India to receive major critical attention internationally, placing India on the world cinema map. It was one of the first examples of Parallel Cinema, a new tradition of Indian film-making in which authenticity and social realism were key themes, breaking the rule of the Indian film establishment. Although Pather Panchali was described as a turning point in Indian cinema, some commentators preferred the view that it refined a \"realist textual principle\" that was already there. In 1963 Time noted that thanks to Pather Panchali, Satyajit Ray was one of the \"hardy little band of inspired pioneers\" of a new cinematic movement that was enjoying a good number of imitators worldwide. The film has since been considered as a \"global landmark\" and \"among the essential moviegoing experiences\". On 2 May 2013, commemorating Ray's birthday, the Indian version of the search engine Google displayed a doodle featuring the train sequence.After Pather Panchali, Ray went on to make 36 more films, including feature films, documentaries and shorts. He worked on scripting, casting, scoring, cinematography, art direction and editing, as well as designing his own credit titles and publicity material. He developed a distinctive style of film-making based, as was the case with Pather Panchali, on visual lyricism and strongly humanistic themes. Thus, Ray established himself as an internationally recognized auteur of cinema."

Shortly after arriving, he meets and falls in love with fiery, red-headed Mary Kate Danaher, the sister of bullying Squire \"Red\" Will Danaher. Will also wants to buy the old Thornton property, and is angered when the property's current owner, the wealthy Widow Tillane, accepts Sean's bid instead of his. Will then retaliates by refusing consent for Sean to marry his sister.\nSome village residents, including Father Peter Lonergan and local matchmaker-cum-bookmaker Michaeleen \u00d3ge Flynn, trick Will Danaher into believing that Widow Tillane will marry him if Mary Kate is no longer under his roof. He gleefully allows the marriage, but he refuses to give Mary Kate her dowry when he finds he was deceived, and the Widow Tillane knows nothing about the deal. Sean, unschooled in Irish customs, professes no interest in obtaining the dowry; but to Mary Kate, the dowry represents her personal value to the community and her freedom. She insists that the dowry must be received to validate their marriage, causing an estrangement between her and Sean. The villagers eventually persuade Will to release Mary Kate's furniture (which she owns), but Will refuses to hand over the monetary part of the dowry (which is his contribution).\nMary Kate believes Sean is a coward for not fighting Will. Sean goes to local Protestant Minister and fellow former boxer, Rev. Cyril Playfair, and reveals that he once accidentally killed a younger, married opponent in the ring. Sean had sworn to give up fighting out of fear and guilt over the manslaughter. Mary Kate also confesses (in Irish Gaelic) her part in the quarrel to Father Lonergan, who berates her for her selfishness. She and Sean partially reconcile that night, and they share the bedroom for the first time since their marriage.\nHowever, the next morning, Mary Kate quietly leaves their cottage and boards a train for Dublin, hoping this pretense of leaving will spur Sean to action. Sean soon learns from Michaeleen where she is, races his horse to the train station, and pulls her off the train. Followed by a growing crowd of villagers, Sean forces Mary Kate to walk with him the five miles (8 km) back to the Danaher farm. There, Sean confronts Will and demands the dower-money. When Will refuses, Sean throws Mary Kate back at her brother, declaring he will abide by the Irish custom \"no fortune, no marriage\". The ultimatum shocks both Mary Kate and Will, who finally pays the \u00a3350 (over \u00a317,000 in 2022). Sean immediately burns it in the boiler, abetted by Mary Kate. She proudly leaves for home, but a humiliated Will takes a swing at Sean, only to be knocked down by Sean's defensive counter-punch.\nA donnybrook ensues, then evolves into a long Homeric fistfight between Sean and Will after they insincerely agree to adhere to the Marquess of Queensberry rules. This much-anticipated match attracts more and more spectators as it continues for miles across the landscape. The fighters finally pause for a drink inside Cohan's Bar, where they begrudgingly admit a mutual respect for one another. As they argue over who will pay for the drinks, Will tosses a brew into Sean's face. Sean punches Will, sending him falling through the bar doors to lie unconscious in the street, ending the fight. Later, the reconciled and inebriated brothers-in-law stagger arm-in-arm back to Sean and Mary Kate's home for supper, much to Mary Kate's amusement and delight.\nThe next day, a humbled Will and the Widow Tillane begin their own courtship, and they ride out of the village side by side in a jaunting car driven by Michaeleen. Sean, Mary Kate, and the villagers wave to them as they pass, before Sean and Mary Kate playfully chase each other across the fields back to the cottage."

        "content": "The film was something of a departure for Wayne and Ford, who were both known mostly for Westerns and other action-oriented films. It was also a departure for Republic Pictures, which backed Ford in what was considered a risky venture at the time. It was the only time the studio, known for low budget B-movies, released a film that would receive an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.Ford read the story in 1933 and soon purchased the rights to it for $10. The story's author was paid another $2,500 when Republic bought the idea, and he received a final payment of $3,750 when the film was actually made. Republic Pictures agreed to finance the film with O'Hara and Wayne starring and Ford directing, but only if all three agreed to first film a Western with Republic. They did, and after completing Rio Grande, they headed for Ireland to start shooting.\nOne of the conditions that Republic placed on Ford was that the film run under two hours. However, the finished picture was two hours and nine minutes. When screening the film for Republic executives, Ford stopped the film at approximately two hours in, on the verge of the climactic fistfight. Republic executives relented and allowed the film to run its full length. It was one of the few films that Republic filmed in Technicolor; most of the studio's other color films were made in a more economical process known as Trucolor.The film employed many actors from the Irish theatre, including Barry Fitzgerald's brother, Arthur Shields, as well as extras from the Irish countryside, and it is one of the few Hollywood movies in which the Irish language can be heard. Filming commenced on June 7, 1951. All of the outdoor scenes were shot on location in Ireland in County Mayo and County Galway. The inside scenes were filmed toward the end of July at the Republic Studios in Hollywood. Vawn Corrigan reports that Ford made considerable efforts to get the costumes correct for the period with \u00d3\u2019Maille \u2013 The Original House of Style in Galway tasked with sourcing the costumes.\nThe story is set in the fictional community of Inisfree. This is not the same as the Lake Isle of Innisfree, a place in Lough Gill on the Sligo\u2013Leitrim county border made famous by poet William Butler Yeats, which is a tiny island. Many scenes for the film were actually shot in and around the village of Cong, County Mayo, on the grounds of Cong's Ashford Castle. Cong is now a wealthy small town and the castle a 5-star luxury hotel. The connections with the film have led to the area becoming a tourist attraction. In 2008, a pub opened in the building used as the pub in the film (it had actually been a shop at the time when the movie was shot); the pub hosts daily re-runs of the film on DVD. The Quiet Man Fan Club holds its annual general meeting in Ashford Castle. Other locations in the film include Thoor Ballylee, County Galway, home of poet W.B. Yeats for a period, Ballyglunin railway station near Tuam County Galway, which was filmed as Castletown station, and various places in Connemara County Galway and County Mayo. Among those are Lettergesh beach, where the horse race scene was filmed, \"The Quiet Man Bridge\", signposted off the N59 road between Maam Cross and Oughterard and the \"White O'Morn\" cottage. The latter is located on R336 south of Maam, but long ago fell into ruin.The film also presents Ford's depiction of an idealized Irish society, with only implied social divisions based on class and differences in political or religious affiliations. The Catholic priest, Father Lonergan, and the Protestant minister, Reverend Playfair, maintain a strong friendly relationship throughout the film, which represented the norm in what was then the Irish Free State, where religious tensions occurred in the 1930s but were the norm only in Northern Ireland. One of the allusions to Anglo-Irish animosity occurs after the happy couple is married and a congratulatory toast offered by Hugh Forbes expresses the wish that they live in \"national freedom\" (the term national has been censored from most editions) and before the final donnybrook when Thornton demands his wife's dowry from Danaher. Danaher asks Hugh Forbes, who had been commander of the local Irish Republican Army unit during the fight to expel the British, \"So the IRA is in this too, ah\", to which Forbes replies, \"If it were, not a scorched stone of your fine house would be standing.\"\nErnie O'Malley, an Irish Republican Army officer during the war of independence, commander of the anti-Treaty IRA during the Irish Civil War, and author, acted as an advisor to Ford on the local culture, being on set with him every day. According to O'Hara, Ford \"had a great deal of respect for Ernie... He had such respect for Ernie. They would natter away like old buddies... They liked each other. They were friends\".This movie is, in many ways a family affair.  Francis Ford, who played the old man who gets up from his deathbed to watch the fight, is John Ford's older brother.  Patrick Ford, the directors son, did much of the stunt work for Victor McLaughlin during the fight scene, and was a unit director.  Arthur Shields, who played the Reverend Playfair, is the younger brother of Barry Fitzgerald, Michaeleen \u00d3ge Flynn, who was born William Joseph Shields. Charles B. Fitzsimmons, who played Hugh Forbes, and James O'Hara, who played Father Paul, are the brothers of Maureen O'Hara.   In addition, four of John Wayne's children are seen in the horse race scene."

Coe of The Washington Post declared it \"a complete jim-dandy ... The photography is glorious and Victor Young's score, inspired by folk airs, is a complete joy for an exuberant, vigorous picture.\" Philip Hamburger of The New Yorker was not so taken with the film, writing, \"If am to believe what I saw in John Ford's sentimental new film, The Quiet Man, practically everybody in Ireland is just as cute as a button,\" adding, \"Mr. Ford's scenes of the Irish countryside are often breathtaking ... but the master who made The Informer appears to have fallen into a vat of treacle.\" In contrast to contemporary reviews of the film, editorial writer Frances Mulraney saw the film as \"misogynistic\" and \"outdated\"\u2014due not just to the psychological and physical control the male characters exert over the female characters, but also for the female lead's gender-based expectations of her husband.On the review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, The Quiet Man in 2023 has a 91% approval rating based on reviews from 46 critics. Critical consensus on the website states, \"Director John Ford and star John Wayne depart the Western for the Irish countryside, and the result is a beautifully photographed, often comedic romance.\"The film was also a financial success, grossing $3.8 million in its first year of release. This was among the top ten grosses of the year. It was also the seventh most popular film for British audiences in 1952."

The film was a major commercial success and one of the biggest pictures of 1926 becoming Warner Brothers' highest grossing film. The Sea Beast is the first adaptation of Herman Melville's 1851 novel Moby-Dick, a story about a monomaniacal hunt for a great white whale. However, the film alters the novel's plotline by establishing prequel and sequel elements that are not in the original story\u2014such as the romancing of Esther and Ahab's safe return, respectively\u2014and substitutes a happy ending for Melville's original tragic one. Some of the characters in the film do not appear in Melville's original novel.  The film was so successful that in 1930 Warner Bros redid it in English and German, under the title Moby Dick, with Joan Bennett taking the role of Ahab's love because Dolores Costello was pregnant at the time."

Meanwhile, an albino whale has been eluding harpooners, and bears the scars of many failed attacks against him. The animal's fame has reached epic proportions. One day, Ahab and Derek are on the same whaler as the whale heaves into view. Ahab raises his harpoon to kill the beast, but at that moment, Derek pushes him overboard and Ahab loses his right leg to the whale. Not long after this incident, the shallow Esther rebuffs Ahab as her suitor once she catches sight of his peg leg. Heartbroken at this turn of events, Ahab blames neither Esther nor his brother; instead he transfers blame and an undying hatred onto the whale. The following saga of Ahab's pursuit of the whale takes on the aura of a super-human quest, far beyond the proportions of its first motivation."

        "content": "John Barrymore signed a three film contract with Warner Brothers in 1925 after the success of 1924's Beau Brummel. Barrymore had always wanted to do a film version of Moby-Dick and insisted on making this film first rather than the prospected first contract film Don Juan. In retrospect and because of this delay, Don Juan became the first Warner feature to have the Vitaphone soundtrack rather than The Sea Beast.\nOne of the most popular of Barrymore's films, this version extends the story beyond the final battle of man versus whale in a variation on Melville's book. Adding publicity to the film was a bit of early Hollywood hype, unintentional though it may seem: the actress Priscilla Bonner was fired by Barrymore from the role of Wiscasset, in preference for his lover, actress Dolores Costello, and Bonner successfully sued the studio and won a considerable out-of-court settlement. Barrymore exploited the romantic scenes with Costello to their full potential in the film, displaying a \"boyish enthusiasm\" according to biographer Margot Peters, which made him fall out with Costello's mother. Barrymore drank heavily during the production of the film, and his eyes were constantly bloodshot, with stubble on his chin. Producer Jack L. Warner said \"that's a great makeup job\" to director Millard Webb, who retorted, \"That's not makeup. It's a hangover\". The ship used in the film, The Narwhal, was actually a former fighting ship with decks stained with blood from fights. The theme in the orchestral score is \"Love's Old Sweet Song\".Due to the success of this film, an all-talking version was released in 1930 under Melville's original book title, with Barrymore again in the role of Captain Ahab. The 1930 film used the plotline of The Sea Beast rather than following Melville's novel. A German-language version, Daemon des Mers, was filmed simultaneously in Hollywood by Warner Bros. It was directed by William Dieterle, beginning his American career."

        "content": "The Sea Beast proved to be \"extremely popular\" with the public, and was generally well received by critics when released in January 1926. The romantic scenes between Barrymore and Costello were particularly well received. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., whose father was an old friend of Barrymore's, said he saw the film half a dozen times. The New Castle News of Pennsylvania called it a \"remarkable picture\" which \"represents the finest in motion picture art\", considering it to be the biggest picture of the year. The Post-Crescent of Appleton, Wisconsin heavily praised the cast and cinematography, referring to it as \"a picture of rich, colorful beauty of heart-searing pathos, of poetry that sings in action of courageous deeds of emotions as violent and eternal as the terrific storms that sweep through the picture\".Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times devoted almost two columns to a review that detailed much of the unfamiliar plot. He found Costello's performance \u201cpraiseworthy\u201d noted the \"energy, earnestness and virility\" John Barrymore displayed in the role of Ahab Ceeley, stating that his \"real triumph in this photoplay comes in the second half of the picture, for he has a great opportunity as the grim master of a whaler with a mixed crew of half-mad yellow, white and black scum\". Hall praised the effectiveness of the scene in whichthe stump of Ahab's leg is cauterized, noting that several women in the audience found the scene hard to take. He believed that the exploits with the whale were not as effective as they could have been, concluding that \"this is a good production and one which contains much interest, but it is not a great photoplay\".Photoplay magazine wrote: \"John Barrymore gives his usual finished performance. His agony is almost too realistic in the scene wherein the sailors cauterize the bloody stump of the leg torn off by the sea beast. It's too gruemsome for the sensitive souls... Dolores Costello's beauty is a delight to behold, and her acting is unbelievably good for a comparative newcomer. The scene in which she first sees the havoc wrought upon her lover by the white whale reaches artistic heights that leave one trembling. And the scene is perfect pictorially.\" However, Movie Monthly was less enthusiastic about the film, declaring that it \"does not come up to expectations, principally because its story turns out to be quite preposterous\"."

Crewman Thor shows his alien contempt for Earth's creatures by needlessly vaporizing a dog named Sparky with a disintegrator raygun. Another crew member, named Derek, discovers an inscription on Sparky's dog tag and fears the Gargons might destroy Earth's native inhabitants. This makes the other aliens scoff at the thought. Being members of the \"supreme race\", they disdain \"foreign beings\", no matter how intelligent; they pride themselves that \"families\" and \"friendships\" are forbidden on their world. Derek reveals an ancient book and turns out to be a member of an underground rebellion, which commemorates the more humane periods of their world's history, before they became mechanized slaves.\n\nAsking for the book, the Captain and Thor disarms Derek. Taking him as prisoner, they plan to put Derek on trial and have him executed by the high court. The Gargon they brought with them suddenly falls sick to Earth's atmosphere. While his crew members are distracted, Derek escapes on foot. Eventually, the Gargon regains consciousness. When the Captain gives his report, it is revealed that Derek is the son of the Leader of their race, although he is unaware of this. Thor is sent to hunt down Derek, with orders to bring him back alive or kill him and any other intelligent beings to protect their mission to Earth. The rest of the crew return to their home world, leaving the Gargon behind in a nearby cave.\n\nMeanwhile, Derek arrives at the address he found on the dog's tag, where he meets Betty Morgan and her Grandpa. They have a room to rent, and Derek inadvertently becomes a boarder. When Betty's friend, reporter Joe Rogers, cannot make it to their afternoon swim at Alice Woodward's place, Derek tags along with Betty. He shows the tag to Betty, who recognizes it immediately. Derek takes her to the place where the spacecraft landed and shows her Sparky's remains. She does not believe him, so he describes Thor's weapon that can also vaporize humans. Betty takes this surprisingly well and vows to help Derek stop his crew mate.\nFor the rest of the day, Betty and Derek have several run-ins with Thor, who vaporizes several humans (including Alice and Professor Simpson from earlier), and Joe follows up on stories of skeletons popping up all over town. Eventually, Thor is wounded in a shootout with the police and then kidnaps both Derek and Betty to help him receive medical attention, in the process revealing Derek's true parentage to them. Two car chases and a gunfight follow, and Thor is finally captured by Earth authorities after plummeting off a cliff in a stolen car.\nShortly after, the Gargon grows immensely large after devouring a policeman investigating the alien's landing site and attacking numerous people. Derek and Betty go to the car wreck site to look for Thor's raygun. They kiss and Derek vows to stay on Earth. The Gargon suddenly appears and ruins their romantic moment but Derek finds the raygun under a rock just in time for them to escape; unfortunately, it is damaged and out of power. The giant Gargon begins heading towards the town so they follow and confront it, having used the electricity from the overhead power lines to fuel the raygun's components. Derek eventually kills the monster, but it's too late: the invading fleet appears in Earth's orbit.\nDerek retrieves Thor from the police and everyone, including Joe and Grandpa, hurry to the landing site. He then reunites with the Captain and meets his father for the first time. Derek pretends to feel regret for his insubordination and offers to help guide the spaceships to land. Derek then goes into the spacecraft alone and makes the ultimate sacrifice: leading the invasion fleet at full speed directly towards his ground location, which causes a massive explosion. Derek's father, the Captain and Thor are killed in the process. Derek is then remembered by Betty for declaring, \"I shall make the Earth my home. And I shall never, never leave it.\""

They imprison him in the Rawalpindi as a Prisoner of War (PoW) and subject him to torture. While being held captive, he reminisces about his romance with Leela.\nLeela comes to Srinagar to work as a doctor. Meanwhile, Varun has an accident while on a joy ride.

Hers is a nobler job than him as he kills and she saves lives. So, Varun takes Leela to a local Registrar office and tells her that they should marry. As she is not ready for marriage, he asks her to think about it and come the next day at 4.00 pm. In a sad turn of events, he leaves for Delhi forgetting about what happened at the Registrar office. This upsets Leela very much. She feels that sometimes he treats her like a Queen whereas at other times like a doormat.\nLeela reveals that she's pregnant. Varun gets hesitant about it and Leela says that she'll take care of her baby by herself. The following day, Leela's grandfather dies. VC goes to her house and finds that Leela's father hates him. That night he goes and tries to convince them, but he doesn't get even a single word from them. Before Varun departs for the Kargil war, Leela tells him that she's resigning and leaving Srinagar. He pleads for one more chance and goes away to war. While fighting he gets shot down by enemy SAM but ejects safely, he gets captured by the enemy and taken a prisoner. Somehow, Varun and the two other prisoners escape from the prison after facing huge challenges and they reach the pak-afghan border. Where they are detained by the Afghan authorities for crossing border, after being detained and interogated for short term they were later handed over to the staff of Indian Embassy in Kabul from where they are repatriated safely back to India. VC receives a grand welcome from his unit and returns back in IAF for Active duties.\nVarun starts searching for Leela. He finds her after 3 years. He tells her that he's a different person now. He says that he regrets his meeting her and loving her only to end up hurting her. VC is surprised to learn that Leela has a daughter. When he sees her daughter, Leela asks him whether she (the small girl) looks like her father or mother. VC's happiness knows no bounds. He tells his daughter that he crossed 7 seas and 7 mountains to meet her. VC asks Leela why she didn't try to contact him, to which she says that she was afraid he wouldn't like her or their daughter. They hug each other and Leela says that Rohini (VC's daughter) is his responsibility from thereon."

        "content": "Upon release, Kaatru Veliyidai received mixed reviews; though critics predominantly praised the performance of Hydari along with Rahman's music and Ravi Varman's cinematography, they criticised Mani Ratnam's screenplay. Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion gave the film a high score of 3.5 out of 5 stars, writing \"as a movie, Kaatru Veliyidai leaves you wanting, but as cinema, very little can come close to it\". Rangan added \"like some of Mani Ratnam\u2019s recent films, Kaatru Veliyidai feels abstracted\" and that the \"director is in his mature phase\" with \"a little less obvious, little more complicated version of storytelling\". Anupama Subramaniam of the Deccan Chronicle wrote \"Mani Ratnam, known for his romantic tales with a different note, surprises you with a fresh angle again\", noting that it was \"a poetic romance that is worth experiencing\", while drawing particular praise for the performances of Karthi and Aditi Rao Hydari. A critic from DNA India noted that the film \"does not disappoint\" and that \"to say that Mani portrays the lovers\u2019 intense passion with a painter's bold and indelible strokes would be no exaggeration\", while similarly Rediff.com's Divya Nair called the film a \"beautiful romance\". Malini Mannath of The New Indian Express wrote that \"Kaatru Veliyidai is visual treat where roses overpower guns\" and that despite a few glitches, it is a \"love poem on celluloid\". Kaveree Bamzai wrote for dailyo that \"Few directors understand women as well as Mani Ratnam. He understands they are complicated, vulnerable, strong, powerful, independent and submissive at the same time. But it is in his writing of Varun that Mani Ratnam shows real spunk. Kaatru Veliyidai may not be Mani Ratnam's best, but it beats Bollywood.\" Tanul Thakur of thewire.in wrote in his analysis that \"Kaatru Veliyidai's portrayal of toxic masculinity through the lens of a successful love story is much more intelligent and unsettling than it lets on.\"Sify's reviewer also praised the film stating \"it is an experience you must enjoy\", stating \"if you like beautiful, intimate, playful, passionate love story in typical Mani Ratnam style then Kaatru Veliyidai is bang on\". Vishal Menon of The Hindu wrote \"there are reasons why Kaatru Veliyidai is certainly no classic\", \"but when you leave the theatre with a lump in your throat, you remember how your love for this director doesn\u2019t arise merely because he makes you smile \u2014 he does so much more than that\". Giving the film their highest score of 2017, Top10Cinema.com wrote \"it\u2019s a custom made film for Maniratnam buffs, who are very well etched up with his trademark pattern of storytelling\" and that \"he film has brilliant flash point of visual and musical poetry with some nuance performances too\". In their review, Behindwoods.com wrote the film \"is a classical poetic love story\" and that \"it is not a film to watch but something to experience, but an experience that not everyone would accept\".In contrast, Karthik Kumar of The Hindustan Times called the film \"an underwhelming love saga\", adding \"visually, Kaatru Veliyidai is beautiful, beyond anyone\u2019s imagination\" but the film \"does not move you emotionally\". Suganth of the Times of India noted \"the leads have charm, and try their best to make us care, but we are never as emotionally invested in the fate of VC and Leela as we should be\", though wrote \"the film is saved to an extent by the technical proficiency on display \u2014 right from Ravi Varman\u2019s lush visuals to Rahman\u2019s peppy score and Sharmishta Roy\u2019s realistic sets, the film is a treat technically\". The Bangalore Mirror's critic wrote \"Kaatru Veliyidai eventually is one of Mani Ratnam\u2019s weaker films and that\u2019s disappointing, thankfully it is not a disaster like Kadal\". Likewise, a critic from The Indian Express wrote \"Kaatru Veliyidai flunks the test\" and \"what we are left with is a few moments in which Hydari impresses, the spectacular scenery, shot by Ravi Varman, and a couple of rousing song-and-dance numbers, powered by A R Rahman\u2019s score\"."

Unniyarcha is portrayed as the embodiment of all virtues. The film also narrates how jealousy takes its roots in the mind of Chanthu,  and how he grows hostile to Aromal, consequently betraying him during a duel. Chanthu was always attracted to Unniyarcha, who always hated him for his cheating behavior. Unniyarcha marries Kunjiraman in spite of Chanthu's objection. Chanthu leaves Puthuram Tharavadu and goes to Tulunadu. Now Aromal has to fight with Aringodar, who is an experienced fighter. Aromal's father, Kannappan Chekavar, calls back Chanthu as second for Aromal for the fight even though it was objected to by Aromal and Unniyarcha. Aringodar encourages Chanthu to make a defective sword for Aromal. During the fight between Aromal and Aringodar, the sword of Aromal breaks into two pieces. Aromal requests Chanthu to give his sword, but Chanthu lies that he has not taken one. Then Aromal throws the broken sword piece at Aringodar, which cuts his head off. Now at Puthuram Tharavadu, everyone sees a fatally wounded Aromal come out of the palanquin and tells that Chanthu had cheated by stabbing him while sleeping. Unniyarcha then pledges to take revenge for this betrayal; and till then, she never ties her hair.

Chanthu finally gets ready to fight with the sons of Puthuram Tharavadu. Finally, after a long fight, Aromalunni tells the 19th secret technique of the kalari he is going to fight.

        "content": "Smallville is an American superhero television series developed by writer-producers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, based on the DC Comics character Superman created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. The series was produced by Millar/Gough Ink, Tollin/Robbins Productions, DC Comics and Warner Bros. Television. Initially broadcast by the WB, the show premiered on October 16, 2001. After its fifth season, the WB and UPN merged to form The CW, the series' later United States broadcaster until its tenth and final season ended on May 13, 2011.\nSmallville follows the coming-of-age adventures of teenage Clark Kent (Tom Welling) in his fictional hometown of Smallville, Kansas, before he formally becomes the Man of Steel. The first four seasons focus on the high school life of Clark and his friends, his complicated romance with neighbor girl Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk), and his friendship with future nemesis Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum). From season five onwards, Smallville ventures into Clark's early adult years, eventually focusing on his career alongside Lois Lane (Erica Durance) at the Daily Planet and introducing other DC comicbook superheroes and villains.\nBefore the series' production, Bruce Wayne, a drama series chronicling the young protagonist's journey toward Batman, was proposed first. Although that series failed to generate interest, it inspired the idea of a Superman origin story, which later became Smallville. Series developers Gough and Millar pitched their \"no tights, no flights\" rule to the president of Warner Bros. Television, reducing the Man of Steel to the bare moral essentials and examining what led Clark Kent to become the iconic superhero. After seven seasons with the show, Gough and Millar departed with little explanation. Smallville was primarily filmed in and around Vancouver, British Columbia, with local businesses and buildings substituting for Smallville locations. Most of the music for the first six seasons was composed by Mark Snow, who incorporated elements of John Williams's musical score from the Superman film series. In season seven, Louis Febre (who worked with Snow from the beginning) became the series' primary composer.\nSmallville was generally positively received when it began. Former Superman star Christopher Reeve expressed approval for the series, making two guest appearances before his death. The pilot episode set a ratings record for a WB debut, with 8.4 million viewers. Over ten seasons the series averaged about 4.34 million viewers per episode, with season two the highest-rated at 6.3 million. By the end of its run, Smallville passed Stargate SG-1 as the longest-running North American science fiction series by episode count. Since its first season, the series received accolades ranging from Emmys to Teen Choice Awards. Smallville spawned a series of young adult novels, a DC Comics bimonthly comic-book, soundtracks and series-related merchandise. All ten seasons are available on DVD in regions 1, 2 and 4. After the series finale in 2011, the story resumed in comic-book form, with 22 issues of Season 11 from April 2012 to November 2013."

        "content": "The regular cast is introduced in season one, with storylines involving a villain deriving power from kryptonite exposure. The one-episode villains were a plot device developed by Gough and Millar. Smallville's first season primarily dealt with Clark Kent's coming to terms with his alien origin and the revelation that his arrival on Earth was connected to the death of Lana Lang's parents. After the first season the series had fewer villain-of-the-week episodes, focusing instead on individual-character story arcs and exploring Clark's origins. Major storylines include Clark's discovery of his Kryptonian heritage and Lex Luthor's escalating conflict with his father, Lionel. The disembodied voice of Clark's biological father, Jor-El, is introduced; he communicates to Clark through his spaceship, setting the stage for plots involving his role in fulfilling Clark's earthly destiny. In a fourth-season arc Clark, instructed by Jor-El, searches for three Kryptonian stones which contain the knowledge of the universe and form his Fortress of Solitude. Clark battles Brainiac in his attempts to release the Kryptonian criminal General Zod, and must capture (or destroy) other escaped Phantom Zone criminals. His cousin Kara arrives, and Lex Luthor discovers Clark's secret. The eighth season introduces Davis Bloome (Smallville's version of Doomsday), and Tess Mercer replaces the departing Lex Luthor. Justin Hartley becomes a series regular as Oliver Queen (Green Arrow) after being a recurring guest in season six. In the ninth season Major Zod (Callum Blue) and other members of Zod's military group are revived (without their Kryptonian powers) by Tess Mercer, and their efforts to regain their powers are the season's central conflict. The final season revolves around Clark's attempts to lose his doubts and fears and become the hero he is meant to be, while confronting his biggest challenges: the coming of Darkseid and the return of Lex Luthor."

        "content": "Tom Welling as Clark Kent, a young man with superhuman abilities who tries to find his place in life after discovering that he is an extraterrestrial in origin and uses his powers to help those in danger. Clark's season-one problems include his inability to share his secret and his desire for a normal life. After months of scouting, Welling was cast as Clark. David Nutter had to convince Welling's manager that the role would not hurt the actor's film career in order to get Welling to read the pilot script. After reading the script, Welling agreed to audition for the role of Clark Kent.\nKristin Kreuk as Lana Lang, the girl next door. Grieving the loss of her parents, she has empathy for everyone and feels connected to Clark. Kreuk was the first to be cast, after Nutter saw an audition tape the actress had sent. Although she left the series after the seventh season, she returned for five episodes in season eight as a special guest star.\nMichael Rosenbaum as Lex Luthor, a billionaire's son sent to Smallville to run the local fertilizer plant. After Clark saves his life, they become fast friends. As the series progresses, Lex's friendship with Clark crumbles until they consider themselves enemies. The role was difficult to cast; Michael Rosenbaum auditioned twice and, feeling that he did not take his first audition seriously enough, outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene indicating where to be funny, charismatic or menacing. His second audition went so well that he was hired. Rosenbaum left the show after seven seasons, reprising his role for the series finale.\nEric Johnson as Whitney Fordman, Lana's boyfriend in season one, who becomes mean to Clark and Lana's budding friendship and bullies him. He reconciles with Clark before joining the Marines and going to Afghanistan. Although Whitney was written out of the show in the first-season finale, he made a special appearance in the season-two episode \"Visage\" (where it is disclosed that he was killed in action) and was also a guest star in the season-four episode \"Fa\u00e7ade\" (during a flashback to Clark's freshman year of high school). Johnson, who auditioned for Lex and Clark before he was cast as Whitney, was pleased that the writers gave his character a hero's exit.\nSam Jones III as Pete Ross, another best friend of Clark and the first person to whom Clark voluntarily tells his secret. Although he is in love with Chloe, he does not admit it because of the Clark-Lana-Chloe love triangle already in place. Ross was written out of the series at the end of season three, but made a guest appearance in season seven. Jones was the last of the series regulars to be cast, with Gough and Millar seeing him four days before they began filming the pilot. Jones is African-American  while the comics have traditionally portrayed Ross as Caucasian.\nAllison Mack as Chloe Sullivan, one of Clark's best friends, who is in love with him (although her feelings are not reciprocated). Editor of the school newspaper, her journalistic curiosity and desire to \"expose falsehoods\" and \"know the truth\" create tension with her friends (especially when she investigates Clark's past). After learning about Smallville from casting director Dee Dee Bradley, Mack considered auditioning for Lana Lang but auditioned twice for Chloe Sullivan. The character was created just for the series and was intended to have an \"ethnic background\" before Mack was hired. She has since appeared in the comic book.\nAnnette O'Toole as Martha Kent, Clark's adoptive mother. She and her husband, Jonathan, give Clark wise advice about coping with his increasing abilities. In season five Martha takes a state-senate seat, and in season six she leaves the show. Although Cynthia Ettinger was originally cast as Martha Kent, during filming everyone (including Ettinger) realized that she was not right for the part. O'Toole was committed to the television series The Huntress when Ettinger filmed the original pilot. Around the time the creators wanted to recast Martha Kent, The Huntress was coincidentally canceled, allowing O'Toole to join the cast. The actress had previously played Lana Lang in Superman III.\nJohn Schneider as Jonathan Kent, Clark's adoptive father, who goes to great lengths to protect his son's secret; according to Schneider, Jonathan is \"perfectly willing to go to jail, or worse, to protect his son\". Schneider was written out of the show in the series' 100th episode, with Jonathan dying of a heart attack on the night of his election victory. Millar and Gough wanted a recognizable face for Smallville; they were happy to cast Schneider as Jonathan because he was known as Bo Duke from The Dukes of Hazzard, which Gough saw as adding to the belief that Schneider could have grown up running a farm.\nJohn Glover as Lionel Luthor, Lex's father. Lionel is responsible for the Kents' adoption of Clark without legal ramifications or questions about his origins. Glover tried to make Lionel seem to try to \"toughen [Lex] up\", and saw the character as a rich, powerful businessman who was disappointed in his son. Lionel was created for Smallville to parallel the Kents and as an \"experiment in extreme parenting\". A recurring first-season guest, Glover became a series regular from seasons two to seven until Lionel was murdered by Lex near the end of the seventh season. Lionel returns in a parallel-universe version, also portrayed by Glover, during the final season as a special guest star.\nJensen Ackles as Jason Teague, Lana's love interest, in season four. He follows Lana to Smallville from Paris, taking a job as the school's assistant football coach, but is fired when their relationship comes to light. By the end of the season, it is disclosed that he was working with his mother to track the three Kryptonian stones of knowledge. Before he was cast as Jason, Ackles was second in line for the role of Clark Kent. Although he received top billing for season four and was contracted for season five, he was written out of the show in the season four finale because of his commitment to Supernatural.Erica Durance as Lois Lane, Chloe's cousin who comes to Smallville to investigate Chloe's supposed death and stays with the Kents. Durance, a recurring guest in season four, became a series regular. The producers wanted to bring Lois Lane to the series, and Chloe's supposed death in the season-three finale provided the opportunity. Durance was cast three days before filming began; although she could initially appear in only four episodes, according to the film division of Warner Bros., after negotiations her character was cleared for more appearances.\nAaron Ashmore as Jimmy Olsen, Chloe's photographer boyfriend who works at the Daily Planet. Ashmore, a recurring guest in season six, became a regular cast member in season seven. He called his casting a welcome surprise: \"I auditioned for [the role] and I put myself on tape. I hadn't heard anything, and a couple of weeks later, all of the sudden (sic), I got the call saying, 'You're going to Vancouver to start shooting Smallville'. It's a dream come true, really\". After three seasons on the series (two as a regular), Ashmore's character was killed off. Although Ashmore's Jimmy Olsen was murdered, he said his character was not the \"real\" Jimmy Olsen, his real name revealed to be Henry James Olsen. Jimmy's younger brother, who appears briefly in the season-eight finale, is intended to be the Jimmy who works with Clark and Lois. Ashmore returns as the younger Jimmy in the series finale.\nLaura Vandervoort as Kara Zor-El, Clark's Kryptonian cousin. Sent to look after Kal-El (Clark), she was in suspended animation for eighteen years. When the dam confining Kara's ship broke in the season-six finale, \"Phantom\", she was set free. She has Clark's abilities, including flight. At the end of the seventh season, Kara was trapped in the Phantom Zone. Although Vandervoort did not return regularly for the eighth season, she returned to wrap up her storylines as a guest in season eight's \"Bloodline\" and as a special guest star in season ten's \"Supergirl\" and \"Prophecy\".\nCassidy Freeman as Tess Mercer, Lex's handpicked successor as LuthorCorp CEO in season eight. Her name is an homage to two Superman characters, Eve Teschmacher and Mercy Graves. Freeman described her character as \"fierce\", \"fun\", and \"intelligent\", with finding Lex her primary season-eight goal. Tess believes that Clark will be able to help her. In the season-ten episode \"Abandoned\", it is disclosed that her birth name is Lutessa Lena Luthor and she is Lionel's illegitimate daughter.\nSam Witwer as Davis Bloome, a \"charismatic\" paramedic struggling with inner darkness, Davis Bloome is Smallville's version of Doomsday (the only character to kill Superman). Davis would come to resemble his comic-book counterpart over the course of the season. Brian Peterson said that with Michael Rosenbaum's departure, the new executive producers were looking for a villain \"as great as Lex\" and Doomsday fit the bill.\nJustin Hartley as Oliver Queen, the CEO of Queen Industries and leader of a small group of superheroes known as the Justice League. Hartley, a recurring guest in the sixth and seventh seasons, became a series regular in season eight and was the producers' first choice to play Oliver Queen. He was designed to shake up Clark and Lois in season six and to give Clark an alternate view of how to fight crime.\nCallum Blue as Zod, an early version of the criminal from Krypton who was sent to the Phantom Zone prison. His character is first mentioned in season five, when Brainiac uses Lex's body as a vessel for Zod's spirit, and he appears in a Kryptonian sphere in the season-eight finale. Smallville's executive producers called this incarnation \"Major Zod\" (as opposed to the typical \"General Zod\"), and in season nine \"the venomous side of Zod rises because he experiences a few key betrayals with our beloved characters\"."

The film was written by Toni Myers, directed by Academy Award-winner Ben Burtt, and narrated by Leonard Nimoy.\nThe film is a showcase of the daily lives of astronauts in space, particularly on the STS-42 Space Shuttle Discovery Spacelab mission, as they fix instruments and take measurements. The film includes two Space Shuttle launches and several cargo bay scenes, including an astronaut repairing the Hubble Space Telescope. CGI recreations of the surface of Venus and Mars based on satellite data from JPL are also featured. The film looks at the future of human space exploration and what future generations might accomplish in the years to come.\nFour filmmakers contributed to directing the film. Director/cinematographer James Neihouse was the cinematographer for Blue Planet, The Dream Is Alive (a 1985 documentary about the Space Shuttle program), Michael Jordan to the Max and other IMAX features. Burtt, aside from his lengthy and impressive list of sound crew credits, directed both Destiny and Blue Planet. Toni Myers edited several IMAX pictures, including L5: First City in Space, Hail Columbia (a 1982 documentary focusing on the first mission of Space Shuttle Columbia), and others.\nSeveral scenes included launch and in-orbit footage from shuttle missions STS-41-C, STS-61-B, STS-31, STS-32, STS-34, STS-40, STS-42, STS-46, STS-51 and STS-61."

Partly this is thanks to the resourcefulness with which the director creates a visual splendour from little except smoke and light, and partly it's the result of an almost arrogantly complex plot from which fragments of meaning seem to escape in all directions.\"Allmovie wrote \"Hercules in the Haunted World is about as good a film as could be made on a budget in the 'mythic hero' subgenre of action films. If that sounds like faint praise, it isn't intended to be, for while overall Hercules can't totally rise above the many limitations of its genre (and budget), it nevertheless will thrill fans of such movies and even give non-devotees a number of very worthwhile elements to ponder.\"\nIn his book Italian Horror Film Directors, Louis Paul described the film as \"a colorful combination of the athletic muscleman peplum revival and Bava's own fascination with gothic imagery.\""

In the process, her pendrive falls into his pocket, without either of them realising. The pendrive consists of six months' worth of Priya's project work, and she needed to submit it. Asking the principal for an extension, Priya searches for Ramesh and manages to find him. She humiliates him, while he denies that the pendrive is with him. After college one day, Ramesh and his friends see Priya on the road. They tease and infuriate her, eventually leading to her slapping him.\nA few days later, while Ramesh's mother (Mounika) is washing his pants, she finds the pendrive. Ramesh realizes that the fault is his and immediately goes to return the pendrive. Priya is impressed with his attitude, as she had expected him to keep the pendrive because she slapped him. This marks the beginning of their friendship. As time passes, Priya and Ramesh become closer. Urged by his friends, Ramesh goes to tell Priya that he loves her. However, while asking for money from his friend Kumar (Karunas), he accidentally takes the condom from Kumar's pocket. When Ramesh sees the condom, he tries to hide it from Priya. However, just then, the police arrives, and he is forced to drop it. Priya sees the condom and is shocked. She denies knowing Ramesh, resulting in him being taken to the police station.\nRamesh is finally brought home and refuses to talk to Priya. His friends try to talk to her, but she does not listen. However, when her friend tells her how much Ramesh actually loves her, she is finally convinced. Ramesh had actually bought Priya a grain of rice with her name written on it. Priya thus realizes that she also loves Ramesh and begins trying to get him to accept her. However, he refuses to accept her as he believes that she thinks of him as lower-class.\nIn a subplot, Ramesh witnesses a murder committed by the local gangster \"Maanja\" Ravi (Prasanna). In shock, Ramesh runs away and eventually trips over an elderly man. The next day, Ravi sends Ramesh to Gujarat, as he fears for his safety. A few days later, the deceased's son appears in the commissioner's office with the elderly man, who claims that he can identify the boy who ran into him. Apparently, the deceased is an ex-MLA, and the commissioner decides to deal with the matter himself. The inspector warns Ravi and his gang, implying to them that the witness should be killed.\nMeanwhile, Priya receives a call from her mother telling her that her father is going for surgery and asks her to return to the US. Priya tells Ramesh that she will be waiting at the bus stop the next day, at the same place where they first met. If he loves her, he would come. The next day, eventually being coaxed by Kumar, Ramesh goes to see her. On the way, Ravi tries to kill him, but his conscience gets the better of him. However, he also knows that there is another goon in the same bus as Priya waiting to kill Ramesh. Ramesh manages to stand in front of Priya, and they hold hands for a while. Ramesh then slips off the steps and is run over by the bus. His mother, friends, and Priya mourn his death, while the goon who was supposed to kill him slips away.\nThe movie ends with Priya in a car, looking at the grain of rice that has her name on it which Ramesh presented to her for her birthday."

        "content": "The Garden of Words (Japanese: \u8a00\u306e\u8449\u306e\u5ead, Hepburn: Kotonoha no Niwa) is a 2013 Japanese anime drama film written, directed and edited by Makoto Shinkai, animated by CoMix Wave Films and distributed by Toho. It stars Miyu Irino and Kana Hanazawa, and features music by Daisuke Kashiwa instead of Tenmon, who had composed the music for many of Shinkai's previous films. The theme song, \"Rain\", was originally written and performed by Senri Oe in 1988, but was remade for the film and was sung by Motohiro Hata. The film was made into a manga, with illustrations by Midori Motohashi, and later novelized by Shinkai, both in the same year as the film.\nThe film focuses on Takao Akizuki, an aspiring 15-year-old shoemaker, and Yukari Yukino, a mysterious 27-year-old woman he keeps meeting at Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden on rainy mornings. While Takao is skipping his morning class to design shoes, Yukari is avoiding work due to personal problems in her professional life. Yukari tells Takao nothing about herself, including her name, while Takao opens up to her, sharing his passion for shoes by offering to make a pair for her. When Takao learns Yukari's identity, emotions come to a head as both learn that they have been teaching each other \"how to walk\". Shinkai wrote the story as a tale of \"lonely sadness\", based on the meaning of the traditional Japanese word for \"love\", and uses shoes as a metaphor for life. The story's motifs include rain, Man'y\u014dsh\u016b poetry, and the Japanese garden. The age difference between the two main characters and their character traits demonstrate how awkwardly and disjointedly people mature, where even adults sometimes feel no more mature than teenagers, according to Shinkai.\nThe Garden of Words premiered at the Gold Coast Film Festival in Australia on April 28, 2013 and had its general release on May 31, 2013 in Japan. For the Japanese premiere, the film was screened with an animated short called Dareka no Manazashi (\u3060\u308c\u304b\u306e\u307e\u306a\u3056\u3057, lit. Someone's Gaze), also directed by Shinkai. The Garden of Words had an unusual release schedule since it was released digitally on iTunes the same day as the Japanese theatrical premier, and its DVD and Blu-ray were released while the film was still in theaters, on June 21. The film has been licensed by Sentai Filmworks in North America, Anime Limited in the UK, and Madman Entertainment in Australia. The film performed well in theaters for an extended period of time and was hosted at many local and international film events. It ranked highly on iTunes Store during 2013 and was selected as the Year's Best Animation in iTunes' Best of 2013. It won the 2013 Kobe Theatrical Film Award and awards at the Fantasia International Film Festival and the Stuttgart Festival of Animated Film. Online reviews were generally favorable with universal praise of the art, though opinions were mixed regarding the story's length, plot and emotional climax."

There, he encounters Yukari Yukino (\u96ea\u91ce \u767e\u9999\u91cc, Yukino Yukari), a 27-year-old woman who is skipping work. Yukari bids him farewell with a tanka (a form of Japanese poetry), leaving Takao puzzled as to its origin and meaning. The two continue to encounter each other and socialize in the park on rainy mornings, but never formally introduce themselves. Takao decides to make a pair of shoes in her size. With the end of the rainy season, he stops visiting the park and focuses on his work.\n\nFollowing summer break, Takao returns to school and spots Yukari, discovering that she is a literature teacher and had been the target of gossip and bullying. To avoid further confrontation, Yukari opted to avoid work and retreat to the park, hoping she would learn to overcome her fears. However, she quits her job and leaves the school. That afternoon, Takao meets Yukari at the park and greets her by reciting the 2,514th poem from the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b Japanese poetry collection, the correct response to her tanka, which he found in a classic Japanese literature textbook. After getting soaked by a sudden thunderstorm, both head to Yukari's apartment and spend the afternoon together. When Takao confesses his love, Yukari is moved, but reminds him that she is a teacher and that she is moving back to her hometown on Shikoku. After Takao excuses himself, Yukari realizes her mistake and runs after him. Still upset, Takao angrily takes back what he had said and criticizes her for being so secretive and never opening up to him. Yukari embraces him and the two cry while she explains that their time together in the park had saved her.\n\nThe credits show Takao barely passing his final exams, but still working towards his goals, while Yukari moves back to Shikoku and resumes her teaching career. In a post-credits scene, Takao revisits the park that winter, reads a letter from Yukari, places her finished shoes on the bench, then vows that he will find her after he has made progress with his career.\nBoth the manga and serial novels share differences from the anime-film. In the manga illustrated by Midori Motohashi, scenes were either added or slightly modified from the anime version. For example, after the conclusion of the rainy season, Takao was unable to visit the park during the only rainy morning that summer because he had scheduled to visit the footwear college he wanted to attend, disappointing Yukari who had hoped to see him. At the conclusion of the story, Yukari is seen wearing the shoes Takao had made for her. In the novel, Takao prepared to study abroad in Italy for his cobbling, and had a party with his family. Before he was in Italy, he exchanged letters with Yukari every month or so, and ended up leaving his email address in one of them. Now with each others' email addresses, every message they sent avoided discussing personal issues such as if they were seeing anyone. In May 2018, he had some days off and decided to return to Tokyo, in which he reunited with Yukari at the garden and delivered his promised shoes."

        "content": "Two common themes among Shinkai's films, including The Garden of Words, are subtle romances and lingering emotions. However, this film's focus on \"lonely sadness\" (koi) was interpreted in a couple of ways. According to Cynthia Webb of The Jakarta Post, the loneliness is seen at the end of the film, when Takao learns to cope with Yukari's move to Shikoku. Luke Carroll at Anime News Network felt the end of the rainy season and the resulting separation created the sense of koi.Bradly Halestorm at Hardcore Gamer  found that, through their conversations, Yukari and Takao found companionship: Takao finding someone he can share his passion with, and Yukari finding someone who treats her as a person. However, because of the age difference, this discovery varied between the characters. For Yukari, an older and more experienced individual, her hopeless feelings of lonely sadness disappeared when she learned she could connect with Takao, a revelation that she saw as her salvation. For Takao, a boy with an unsupportive family and friends who seemed more like acquaintances, he did not realize his lack of companionship until he discovered it with Yukari, a new feeling he mistook for romantic love but only realized its true nature after she had moved away. Instead, the love they shared was more basic, making the age difference immaterial. At the end of film, both characters maintained their friendship through letters, but otherwise began growing as people by moving on with their lives and presumably finding new relationships with other people. The hope was that one day they could reunite and renew their companionship \"without needing to cling to each other\". However, neither could \"learn to walk again\" if they continued to isolate themselves from the rest of the world and take shelter with each other in the garden at Shinjuku Gyoen.\nAnother one of the themes discussed by the film's reviewers was rain or water. According to Cynthia Webb, the rain represented \"unfulfilled longing\", while Bradly Halestorm saw water as a third main character to the story, acting to both bring Takao and Yukari together and to symbolize the renewal of life. In this way, the rain comes to represent their loneliness, while simultaneously acknowledging Shinkai's statement that the rain symbolized uncontrollable love."

One day, Kombaiah is stabbed in his neck by someone, and the news comes as a shock to the entire town. Now, Kidaari sets stage to find the culprit behind the assault and lists out all the suspects. The movie goes into flashback mode, frequently detailing the rivalry between Kombaiah and each suspect. Finally, Kidaari finds out that Kombaiah\u2019s brother in-law and close aide, Kombaiah's friend (Mu Ramaswamy), was responsible for the assault. Kombaiah's friend admits that Kombaiah was stabbed accidentally when he tried to safeguard himself from Kombaiah. A flashback is shown detailing the rivalry between Kombaiah and his own son Nambi (Vasumithra).\nThe only daughter of Kombaiah's friend was married to Kombaiah\u2019s son Nambi. Trouble erupts between Nambi and his father Kombaiah, which leads to Kombaiah killing his own son. This worries Kombaiah's friend as his daughter has become a widow because of Kombaiah. This was the reason for his anger over Kombaiah. He also discloses the truth to Kidaari about the death of his father Kottur Durai (Napoleon). Years back, Kotur Durai was a henchman to a politician named S. N. Kaalai (Hareesh Peradi), while Kombaiah was a sidekick to Kotur Durai. However, Kombaiah betrays and kills Kottur Durai and then Kaalai. He then stages a drama that Kaalai killed Kottur Durai and he had revenged by killing Kaalai, which helped him establish himself as a don in the town. Knowing this, Kidaari feels bad as Kombaiah\u2019s affection towards him was fake. He visits him in the hospital and informs him that he had understood Kombaiah's true intentions. Kombaiah is saved but loses his speech, and Kidaari becomes the don of the town. Kidaari spares Kombaiah but has instigated a fear of death in his mind, which Kidaari thinks is a bigger punishment."

Sam has single-handedly brought up his son since his wife died in a swimming accident 14 years ago and looks after him day and night. Upon discovering Sam has less than five months to live, he multiplies his efforts to help Dafu learn basic tasks in order to care for himself, as well as searching for a home for him, before he passes away. As the story progresses, the growing relationship between father and son, as well as the community around them, become clearer. Ling ling (Gwei Lun-mei) plays the role of a clown who is part of a small traveling circus (they perform in the aquarium for a short period of time) and who gets on well with Dafu, leading to a close friendship between them.\nThough Dafu struggles to learn many basic tasks, Sam perseveres in teaching his son the tasks that he will need to know how to perform himself once his father dies. Though Sam never gave up teaching and explaining things to Dafu in a positive and supportive and memorable manner, he did contemplate ending his and Dafu's existence together rather than leave his child to suffer without him. Sam, at this point had yet to tell anyone how far his health had deteriorated, until one day while returning from their hometown, his neighbor tells Sam his doctor came from the city with bags of free medicine and waited two hours for him. Meanwhile, Principal Liu, of the boarding school for mentally challenged children that Dafu attended as a child, recommends Dafu to a newly opened institution where he can stay after his father dies.\nDafu continues learning, though Sam must move into the institution with him to help him adjust. Ling Ling, knowing that she is about to have to leave with her circus, teaches Dafu to pick up the phone in the aquarium when he hears it, and she will talk to him.\nLing Ling leaves with her circus. Sam, for the first time in the movie, swims in the aquarium with his son, dressed in a sea turtle costume he made by hand, telling his son not to be afraid when he is gone; he will be like the turtles in the aquarium, always swimming close by with him. He almost drowns but is helped from water by Mr. Tang and while they chat, Sam reveals his wife's death might not have been an accident as she was a very good swimmer and they had recently found out Dafu is autistic. Sam doesn't blame her for not being able to handle their son's circumstances. There was only one instance in which Sam loses his composure with Dafu, while he is nearing the end, and still working and trying to teach his son how to do his job, Dafu is distracted and Sam yells at him. Less than a moment later and Sam is already mending fences and reassuring his son.\nSam eventually dies, and his funeral is attended by close friends and family. Dafu waves good bye to the sky/Sam, as it seems he has learned people live there, something Ling Ling explained to him earlier when she spoke of her grandmother with him before she left town. After the funeral, Dafu is seen doing some of the things that his father struggled so much to teach him with success. He cooks by himself, knows how to ride the bus, and picks up the phone when Ling Ling calls, and working at the ocean park, a place Mr. has opened the doors for Dafu at any time of the day. It is implied that from then on, Dafu will know how to lead his life on his own, though he still has Sam's old friends helping him along the way."

The film is an Italian\u2013American venture produced by The Ladd Company, Embassy International Pictures, PSO Enterprises and Rafran Cinematografica, and distributed by Warner Bros. Based on Harry Grey's novel The Hoods, it chronicles the lives of best friends David \"Noodles\" Aaronson and Maximilian \"Max\" Bercovicz as they lead a group of Jewish ghetto youths who rise to prominence as Jewish gangsters in New York City's world of organized crime. The film explores themes of childhood friendships, love, lust, greed, betrayal, loss, and broken relationships, together with the rise of mobsters in American society.\nIt was the final film directed by Leone before his death five years later, and the first feature film he had directed in 13 years. It is also the third installment of Leone's Once Upon a Time Trilogy, which includes Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) and Duck, You Sucker! (1971). The cinematography was by Tonino Delli Colli, and the film score by Ennio Morricone. Leone originally envisaged two three-hour films, then a single 269-minute (4 hours and 29 minutes) version, but was convinced by distributors to shorten it to 229 minutes (3 hours and 49 minutes). The American distributors, The Ladd Company, further shortened it to 139 minutes (2 hours and 19 minutes), and rearranged the scenes into chronological order, without Leone's involvement.\nThe US edit was a critical and commercial flop in the United States, and critics who had seen both versions harshly condemned the changes made. The original \"European cut\" has remained a critical favorite and frequently appears in lists of the greatest films of all time, especially in the gangster genre."

They enter a wayang theater, where the proprietors slip into a hidden opium den within the building and warn Noodles. He is apathetic, drugged and grasping a newspaper featuring the demise of bootleggers Patrick Goldberg, Philip Stein and Maximilian Bercovicz. He recalls observing police removing their corpses, Max's burned beyond recognition. Noodles evades capture and leaves the city alone and penniless.\nIn 1921, David \"Noodles\" Aaronson and his friends \"Patsy\" Goldberg, \"Cockeye\" Stein and Dominic struggle as street kids in Manhattan's Lower East Side, committing petty crimes for local boss Bugsy. Max foils one of their robberies but has the booty stolen from him by a corrupt police officer, Whitey. Later, they blackmail the officer, catching him having sex with Peggy, an underage prostitute, and the five youngsters start a gang with the same level of police protection as Bugsy. Max and Noodles become best friends.\nThe group rises through the ranks after implementing Noodles's idea to hide bootleg liquor. They stash half their earnings in a railway station locker, giving the key to \"Fat Moe,\"  a friend not directly involved in their activities. Noodles is in love with Moe's sister, Deborah, who dreams of becoming a dancer and actress. Bugsy, now a rival, eventually ambushes the boys and shoots little Dominic, who dies in Noodles's arms. In a fit of rage, young Noodles kills Bugsy and injures a police officer and is sentenced to prison.\nNoodles is released in 1930 and rejoins his friends, now prosperous bootleggers during Prohibition. His first job with them is a diamond heist using a jewelry employee and occasional prostitute named Carol as their informant. During the robbery, Carol goads Noodles into hitting her, after which he rapes her; she later goes on to become Max's moll. That the job had been commissioned by a Syndicate figure to eliminate the competition sits badly with Noodles who, unlike Max, dislikes hierarchy and lacks political ambition. The gang provides protection for Teamsters' union boss Jimmy O'Donnell, but Noodles later rejects Max's plan to deepen those ties.\nSeeking to form a genuine intimacy with Deborah, Noodles takes her on a lavish date, where she reveals her plans to pursue a career in Hollywood. On their drive back, a frustrated Noodles rapes her in the limousine. He is later met with Deborah's aloofness when he watches her board the train to California.\nThe gang's success ends with the 1933 repeal of Prohibition. Max suggests a New York Federal Reserve Bank heist, which Noodles and Carol deem a suicide mission. Carol convinces Noodles to inform the police about a lesser offense, hoping brief incarceration will cool off Max's ambition. After Noodles calls the police, Max knocks him out during a seemingly impromptu argument. This leads to the events shown in the prologue: upon regaining consciousness and learning that Max, Patsy, and Cockeye have been killed by the police, a guilt-ridden Noodles hides in the opium den. He saves Moe but finds out that his new girlfriend Eve has been murdered and the railway locker money has disappeared. With his gang killed and himself hunted by Syndicate thugs, Noodles settles in Buffalo under the alias \"Robert Williams\".\nIn 1968, Noodles is belatedly informed that the Beth Israel Cemetery is being redeveloped and is asked to rebury any loved ones. Upon inquiry, the rabbi who had sent the letter informs him that the bodies of his three dead friends have since been relocated to Riverdale. Realizing that someone has deduced his identity, Noodles returns to Manhattan and stays with Moe. Inside the Riverdale mausoleum, Noodles finds a key to the railway locker. The caption on the commemorative plaque falsely states that the mausoleum was erected by Noodles himself.\nThe locker reveals a suitcase full of money and a note stating this is a down payment on his next job. Noodles watches news of an assassination attempt on controversial U.S. Secretary of Commerce Christopher Bailey. The report shows Jimmy O'Donnell, still a Teamsters boss, distancing himself from the Bailey corruption scandal. Noodles finds Carol in a retirement home run by the Bailey Foundation. She tells him that Max manipulated them into tipping him off to the police and opened fire first, wishing to die young rather than in an insane asylum like his father.\nAfter spotting her in the retirement home's dedication photo, Noodles tracks down Deborah, still an actress. He tells her about his invitation to a party at Bailey's mansion. Deborah admits to being Bailey's lover and begs Noodles to leave before he is confronted with hurtful revelations. Ignoring Deborah's advice, Noodles sees Bailey's son just outside, who evidently looks like a younger Max.\nAt the party, Noodles meets Bailey, who reveals he is actually Max and that he faked his death with the help of the police and Syndicate, stole the gang's money and reinvented himself as a self-made, Teamsters-connected politician. He confirms that he made Deborah his mistress years earlier. Faced with ruin and the specter of a Teamster assassination, Max reveals the job he has for Noodles is to kill him. Noodles, obstinately referring to him by his Bailey identity, refuses, explaining that in his eyes, Max died with the gang. As Noodles leaves the estate, a garbage truck starts up and a man, presumably Max, walks from the entrance toward Noodles until the truck passes between them. Noodles sees the truck's auger conveyor grinding garbage, but the man is nowhere to be seen.\nIn 1933, Noodles enters the opium den after his friends' deaths, taking the drug and broadly grinning."

It received a raucous, record-breaking ovation of nearly 20 minutes after the screening (reportedly heard by diners at restaurants across the street from the Palais), at a time in Cannes's history before marathon applause became a regular occurrence. In the United States, a heavily edited version of the film received a wide release in 894 theaters on June 1, 1984, and grossed $2.4 million during its opening weekend. It ended its box office run with a gross of just over $5.3 million on a $30 million budget, and became a box office bomb.Numerous women at the film's premiere reacted furiously, mostly due to the two rape sequences. One among them later confronted Robert De Niro in a press conference and made harsh comments to the film's depiction, describing it as \"blatant, gratuitous violence.\" In general, the rape scenes specifically were controversial. Richard Godden defended Leone's representation of rape that it \"articulates the dysfunction between bodies in images and bodies themselves.\" \nOf the scene in which De Niro's character rapes her character, Elizabeth McGovern said it \"didn't glamorize violent sex: it is extremely uncomfortable to watch and it is meant to be.\" She went on to state:\n\nAnd if you say, \"this violence is wrong\", you'd have to enlarge that to say, \"all violence in movies in wrong\", and then you'd have to say, \"you can only make movies about good people who obey the law and do right things\" which a) excludes a lot of what life is and b) makes for some very boring movies.In his book, Leone scholar Christopher Frayling argues that the movie's central gang are all emotionally stunted: \"... like small boys obsessed with their equipment who have no idea how to relate to flesh-and-blood women.\""

        "content": "The initial critical response to Once Upon a Time in America was mixed, because of the different versions released worldwide. While internationally the film was well received in its original form, American critics were much more dissatisfied with the 139-minute version released in North America. This condensed version was a critical and financial disaster, and many American critics who knew of Leone's original cut attacked the short version.\nSome critics compared shortening the film to shortening Richard Wagner's operas, saying that works of art that are meant to be long should be given the respect they deserve. In his 1984 review, Roger Ebert gave the uncut version four stars out of four and wrote that it was \"an epic poem of violence and greed\", but described the American theatrical version as a \"travesty\". Furthermore, he gave the American theatrical version one star out of four, calling it \"an incomprehensible mess without texture, timing, mood, or sense.\" Ebert's television film critic partner Gene Siskel considered the uncut version to be the best film of 1984 and the shortened, linear studio version to be the worst film of 1984. Vincent Canby of The New York Times criticized the nonlinear narrative that is structured throughout the film.It was only after Leone's death and the subsequent restoration of the original version that critics began to give it the kind of praise displayed at its original Cannes showing. The uncut original film is considered to be far superior to the edited version released in the U.S. in 1984. Ebert, in his review of Brian De Palma's The Untouchables, called the original uncut version of Once Upon a Time in America the best film depicting the Prohibition era. James Woods, who considers it to be Leone's finest film, mentioned in the DVD documentary that one critic dubbed the film the worst of 1984, only to see the original cut years later and call it the best of the 1980s. Some were critical towards the movie's graphic violence and cruelty, with Donald Clarke of The Irish Times condemning it as a \"fistful of misogyny\" and \"offensively sexist\".On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Once Upon a Time in America has an approval rating of 87% based on 55 reviews, with an average score of 8.50/10. The website's critic consensus reads, \"Sergio Leone's epic crime drama is visually stunning, stylistically bold, and emotionally haunting, and filled with great performances from the likes of Robert De Niro and James Woods.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 75 out of 100 based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".The film has since been ranked as one of the best films of the gangster genre. In Empire magazine, critic Adam Smith compared the film favourable to The Godfather, saying, \"Leone's film is arguably the better of the two - if the less popular - eschewing, as it does, the soapy melodramatics of Coppola's family saga in favour of less audience-friendly, but more intriguing, ambiguity and symbolism.\"When Sight & Sound asked several UK critics in 2002 what their favorite films of the last 25 years were, Once Upon a Time in America placed at number 10. In 2015, the film was ranked at number nine on Time Out's list of the 50 best gangster films of all time, while in 2021, The Guardian cited it as the fourth greatest mobster film ever made."

        "content": "As the film begins and ends in 1933, with Noodles hiding in an opium den from syndicate hitmen, and the last shot of the film is of Noodles in a smiling, opium-soaked high, the film can be interpreted as having been a drug-induced dream, with Noodles remembering his past and envisioning the future. In an interview by No\u00ebl Simsolo published in 1987, Leone lent support to this interpretation, saying that the scenes set in the 1960s could be seen as an opium dream of Noodles'. In the DVD commentary for the film, film historian and critic Richard Schickel states that opium users often report vivid dreams, and that these visions have a tendency to explore the user's past and future.The ending in which Max appears as Noodles is leaving Bailey's mansion and then suddenly disappears behind a truck only for Noodles to see the blades of the truck spinning, was reportedly left ambiguous on purpose. James Woods, who played Max, stated that he does not know if Max jumped in the truck or just disappeared. Critic Carlo Affatigato described this twist as a \"paradox,\" postulating that the whole film is about how Noodles spends the second half of his life seeking out the truth of what happened, only to discover it, not accept it, and not investigate what happens to Max in the end. Noodles only wants to believe the reality he has created for himself, not an objective one. Affatigato also believes this could point to it all being the imagination of Noodles.Many people (including Schickel) assume that the 1968 Frisbee scene, which has an immediate cut and gives no further resolution, was part of a longer sequence. Ebert stated that the purpose of the flying disc scene was to establish the 1960s time frame and nothing more."

Raghu, being an honest man, tells Shanthi that he cheated on her with a coworker when he was in Goa. She immediately leaves for her mother's house. Raghu, being a transformed gentleman, tries to stop her by apologising, but in vain. Raghu's brother Vijay, being a good and supportive brother, and Shanthi's brother Suriya, being a non-emotive but supporting brother, meet in a cinema theatre. Vijay blames Shanthi to be the cause of the problem, and Suriya blames Raghu for the same. They keep on fighting at every chance. Meanwhile, both Vijay and Suriya find their own lovers in Akhila and Asha respectively and fall in love.\nOne day, Raghu finds a bundle of cash on his table and meets Muthukumaraswamy, the person who kept the money there. Raghu finds out that Muthukumaraswamy is a businessman who is wanted by the police for the crime of forex fraud. Muthukumaraswamy wants to leave the country to escape from the police, and he needs a fake passport to flee the country; otherwise, the police will catch him. Since his passport is confiscated by the police, he tells Raghu to get one for him, but Raghu, being a sincere officer, disagrees and calls the police instead. Muthukumaraswamy gets angry and promises to take revenge on Raghu. Meanwhile, Raghu and Shanthi apply for a divorce according to the Hindu Law of Divorce. Child custody of their daughter Sona, who was in Shanthi's sister's house when the break-up occurred, is given to the mother by the court. One day, Suriya takes Sona to a festival fair and somehow loses her. In the confusion that follows, Sona falls from a Ferris wheel and is taken to the hospital by Vijay. She is brought to Raghu's house once she recovers. Soon, Vijay discovers that Sona has lost her hearing in the accident. Some days later, Suriya finds that Sona is missing. Suriya finds Vijay, and the two get into a huge fight. Then, Raghu tells everyone that Sona is in his sister's house. Since Sona's custody is given to the mother, this action of Raghu's is wrong in the eyes of the law.\nShanthi and Suriya, accompanied by a lawyer, come to Raghu's house to get Sona back. At that time, Raghu suffers a serious asthma attack while in the bathroom, and everyone saves him. After recovering, Raghu tells everyone that Sona is not in his sister's house but has been kidnapped by Muthukumaraswamy, who is out on bail. In a turn of events, Raghu issues a fake passport to Muthukumaraswamy, but Raghu does not want him to escape from the police. The two heroes join hands to make sure that this does not happen. Sona is with Muthukumaraswamy's wife, Maya and brother-in-law, Kachiram in a van. Vijay and Suriya both search for Sona, then find out that she is in a van. Sona, after seeing both Vijay and Suriya on a bike, throws her family photo from the van. Meanwhile, the van reaches the safe place, and Kachiram calls Muthukumaraswamy to share the news of their arrival. They both decide to insert a bomb in Sona's hearing device. Maya then decides to save the child. Her brother Kachiram fights her and puts her in the van and activates the bomb which will explode in 10 mins. Then, Vijay and Suriya catch the van, and a fight between Kachiram and Vijay ensues. Meanwhile, Suriya takes Sona home along with her hearing device which still has the bomb. In the middle of the fight, Kachiram drives away in a car. Maya shouts to Vijay to save Sona by telling him about the bomb.

The film was briefly reported to be titled Manasukkul Varalaama? (Can I Come into your Heart?) and also featured Swathi in the cast. Prabhu Deva was touted as a potential replacement to Ajith, though Vasanth then opted to replace Ajith with a debutant as he was able to commit under short notice.

Vasanth had earlier unsuccessfully tried to persuade Suriya to star in his previous film, Aasai, in 1995 but the actor's father insisted that Suriya was finally ready to act.During the test shoot for the film, cinematographer K. V. Anand revealed that the team were worried how Suriya was going to stand opposite Vijay and that they made him wear two inch heels and made him put some shoulder pads. He added that for the first four days during the shoot in Kolkata, Suriya appeared to be uncomfortable in front of the camera and used to tell the team that he didn't want to do the film. The film was the first Tamil project signed by Simran who was signed by Vasanth after he was impressed with her looks in Tere Mere Sapne, though Once More and VIP released earlier. Vasanth signed on Kausalya after seeing and being impressed with her picture at a jewellery shop and was unaware that she had already made her debut in the hit film Kaalamellam Kadhal Vaazhga. The director revealed he had great difficulty in filming the song \"Engengae\", as crowds in Kolkata refused to co-operate with the technical team. The filming mainly took place in and around Trivandrum and Kochi, with some minority portions being shot in Chennai."

Aravindan. A mythological film, its story was adapted from C. N. Sreekantan Nair's play of the same name, which is a reworking of Valmiki's Ramayana.\nThe film interprets a story from the Uttara Kanda of the epic poem Ramayana, where Rama sends his wife, Sita, to the jungle to satisfy his subjects. Sita is never actually seen in the film, but her virtual presence is compellingly evoked in the moods of the forest and the elements. The film retells the epic from a feminist perspective. It was shot in the interior tribal areas of Andhra Pradesh. The roles of the epic heroes are played by Rama Chenchu tribal people, who claim lineage to the mythological Rama. Director Aravindan interweaves the Samkhya-Yoga philosophical concepts of Prakriti-Purusha bonds throughout the film.\nThe film was produced by K. Ravindran Nair under the banner of General Pictures. The film features an original score by classical musician Rajeev Taranath, cinematography by cinematographer-turned-director Shaji N. Karun, editing by Ramesan, and art direction by Artist Namboothiri. The film became a major critical success upon its release in 1977, although a few mainstream critics panned it.

Rama and Lakshmana return to Ayodhya to face Urmila, the spirited wife of Lakshmana. Rama replies to her reproaches for abandoning Sita in the Dandakaranya forests, through which they have just journeyed, that the husband of Sita is only a servant of the people of Ayodhya.\nThe next day, Vasishta arrives to suggest that Rama perform the Ashvamedha yaga (the ritual sacrifice of a horse to Agni, the god of fire) but Rama cannot do without his wife by his side. He is averse to taking a second wife, as Vasishta further suggests. The anguish of Rama at this point is juxtaposed with the people of Ayodhya joyously celebrating the harvest.\nBharata, a brother of Rama who had left Ayodhya twelve years ago, returns. He objects to Rama performing the yaga without Sita. Their argument almost culminates in a physical fight, but nature intervenes; the skies open and a cooling rain pours down upon them.\nThe yaga begins, with Lakshmana accompanying the horse. The horse strays into Valmiki's ashram (hermitage), where Rama's son Lava and Kusha are being brought up. Lava stops the horse and is ready to fight Lakshmana (as the yaga demands). Lakshmana orders that the horse be released, but once again nature takes a hand. Valmiki is strangely moved by what he sees, and he begins to compose the Uttara Rama Charita \u2013 the story of Rama.\nThe horse is led back to Ayodhya, and the ritualistic second stage of the yaga starts. Just then Rama receives the news that Shambuka has resumed his penance, and Lakshmana is despatched to slay the erring shudra. As the ceremony nears completion, Valmiki arrives with Lava and Kusha, but Vasishta debars Valmiki from entering the yagashala. Rama recognises Lava and Kusha as his sons, and takes them to his heart. The joy of Sita, then, is represented in the glorious splendour of nature."

        "content": "The Samkhya-Yoga philosophical concepts of Prakriti-Purusha bonds are used in the film. Prakriti and Purusha, as philosophical concepts, have their genealogy in the Samkhya-Yoga school of Indian philosophy. In Samkhya thought, Purusha is the Transcendental Self or Pure Consciousness. It is absolute, independent, free, imperceptible, unknowable, above any experience, and beyond any words or explanation. It remains pure, nonattributive consciousness. Purusha is neither produced nor does it produce. Unlike Advaita Vedanta and like Purva-Mimamsa, Samkhya philosophy emphasises the plurality of the Purushas. Prakriti is the first cause of the universe \u2013 of everything except the Purusha, which is uncaused, and accounts for whatever is physical, both matter and force. Through its threefold gunas or characteristics of the physical universe, Prakriti binds Purusha, the self (in the minimal sense of awareness or sentience), which itself is not distinct from Prakriti. A written commentary that throws light on Aravindan's interpretation of the play precedes his film proper. The opening scroll reads, \"This film is an interpretation of the Uttara Kanda of the Ramayana. Our mythologies and the epics are constantly re-created in retellings. The epic is the basis for this visual interpretation as well. This film deviates from established norms in how it visualises the protagonists and portrays the course of events in the epic.\" The scroll explains that the film will try to reflect what it calls the epic's adi-sankalpam (original conception) of the theme and the protagonists. It states that \"the inner essence of the film is that woman is Prakriti. Ultimately Purusha, here conceived of as the masculine self, dissolves into Prakriti. Ezhuthachan's Adhyathma Ramayana, one of the first Malayalam poems, also views Rama as Purusha and Sita as Prakriti. Aravindan stated in an interview that \"C. N. [Sreekantan Nair] had made clear the prakriti-purusha notion in Ramayana\". But Aravindan took the extraordinary cinematic step of representing Sita as Prakriti."

        "content": "The film received mixed reviews from critics, but is widely regarded as a landmark film in Indian cinema history. It is credited with the formation of a new trend towards independent filmmaking in South India. The Hindu described Kanchana Sita as one of the most poetic films in Malayalam. Scholar V. Rajakrishnan noted that Aravindan had not fully considered the implications of locating Rama's story in an Adivasi community. Rajakrishnan pointed out that the rigid economy of expression and the subdued acting styles, which appear to render all dialogue artificial, reduce the element of human drama that is so prominent in Sreekantan Nair's play. Poet and scholar Ayyappa Panicker views Sita's absence as typical of Aravindan's style, in which there is a conscious, meticulous effort \"not to communicate in order to communicate\". Panicker described Aravindan's expressive style using his own concept of antarasannivesa, or the poetics of interiorisation. \"Sita is not a woman, or an individual, but an eternal concept in the film\", Panicker said in an interview. The Hindu critic Sashi Kumar stated, \"In the film, Aravindan synthesises into a consummate whole his marginality principle and his anthropomorphic contemplation of nature.\" Vidyarthy Chatterjee of The Economic Times said, \"Visually stunning in many passages and using sound in such a manner as to make for heightened aesthetic pleasure, Kanchana Sita is a milestone that has unfortunately been bypassed by many who would have done better to focus on its innovative elements\". Yves Thoraval said, \"Kanchana Sita is a visually dazzling film illustrating this long mythological episode potentially rich in dialogue but of which G. Aravindan has chosen to make a non-realist, virtually silent and contemplative film by calling up a tribal population to portray the mythological characters\".The National Film Award for Best Direction was given to Aravindan for \"the film's courageous and uncompromising exploration of an ancient epic theme through a pronouncedly new cinematic language, for making the camera speak more eloquently than the introspective characters of the Ramayana, for projecting against the vast backdrop of nature, for matching profound philosophical ideas with astonishing evocations of the beauties of the physical world\"."

Twenty years prior, their rich father from a nearby town married another woman and kicked the rest of Siri's family, humiliating them on the way. Their mother dies leaving toddler Siri in the care of 13-year-old Sivaramakrishna. With help of relatives, her grave is built on the small land which the siblings inherited, but the Zamindar Muddu Krishnaiah tells them that it is his land, since their mother had not repaid a loan from the man. Sivaramakrishna begs Muddu Krishnaiah and asks for an extension promising to work day and night to pay off the loan, as long as they don't tear down his mother's grave. Muddu Krishnaiah agrees upon security from the local station master. Slowly, Sivaramakrishna turns the tables using his handwork and becomes a rich enough farmer, and Siri grows up to complete engineering in a nearby town. One day, Lalitha, Siri's best friend from school time comes to their house to invite Siri to their house as she is getting married. Sivaramakrishna agrees to send Siri a week ahead of the marriage. Santosh(Siddharth), Lalitha's cousin, a rich city boy born to millionaire parents Janaki and Prakash and brought up in London, also arrives on the same day with his mother.\nSlowly, Santosh and Siri fall in love, but Janaki does not bear it as Siri is a poor girl, and thus does not meet their standards. Santosh is also to be married to Janaki's brother Srinivasa Rao's business partner's (JP) daughter\u2019s Dolly. When Sivaramakrishna arrives at the wedding, Janaki humiliates him as well as Siri. Both are thrown of the house after Janaki accuses them of trying to entice and trap Santosh. When Santosh learns of this, he goes to Siri's house and pleads to her brother to accept him. Sivaramakrishna gives him a chance, just like he was given a chance by Krishnaiah when he was a child. Santosh is tasked to take care of the cows, clean up after them, and grow more crops than Sivaramakrishna by the end of the season; if he does not, Santosh shall leave the village forever and never see Siri again. Krishnaiah is not happy as he wanted his son to marry Siri. With them, Dolly, and her father trying to get Santosh to lose the competition, Santosh has to work hard for his love, eating red chillies and rice every day, even though he can't bear it. In spite of many antics from Krishnaiah's and Dolly's side, Santosh eventually proves his love for Siri to Sivaramakrishna and succeeds in growing more grain. However, Krishnaiah and JP kidnap Siri and then try to force her to marry his son. A fight takes place in which Santosh kills Krishnaiah\u2018s son while Sivaramakrishna violently defeats Santosh's uncle's business partner and Krishnaiah. After realizing that Santosh and Siri should be together, Sivaramakrishna takes the blame for the murder and spends five years in prison.\nSivaramakrishna is released from prison after five years and Janaki accepts Siri as her daughter-in-law. Finally Siri and Santosh get married, in everyone's presence."

Seeing how the muted tones of his own painting paled next to Constable's vibrant work, in a quick stroke Turner adds a smear of red paint representing a buoy.

But they also convey the spirit of a man whose reputation as a curmudgeon is unwarranted, given his passionate interest in people and the world around him. There is a great humanitarian streak in Turner and Mike Leigh has found a way of capturing this on film, as he has done so often before.\u201dMatt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film three and a half out of four, writing that like Leigh's 1999 film Topsy-Turvy, about the creation of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Mikado, \"[Mr. Turner] understands creative people on every conceivable level, and translates that understanding with a deftness rarely seen outside of astute documentaries about creative people. To watch it is to feel as though you're a part of its world... experiencing tiny fluctuations in received wisdom and sudden changes of artistic direction that can only be sensed by professionals who are plugged into their art form, and completely in command of their talents.\""

        "content": "The film exhibits a series of sculptures, masks and other traditional art from Sub-Saharan Africa. The images are frequently set to music and cut to the music's pace. The narrator focuses on the emotional qualities of the objects, and discusses the perception of these works of art, craft, and utility from a historical and contemporary European perspective. Only occasionally does the film provide the geographical origin, time period, or other contextual information about the objects. The idea of a dead statue is explained as a statue which has lost its original significance and become reduced to a museum object, similarly to a dead person who can only be found in history books. Interwoven with the objects are a few scenes of Africans performing traditional music and dances, as well as the death of a disemboweled gorilla.\nDuring the last third of the film, the modern commercialisation of African culture is problematised. The film argues that colonial presence has compelled African art to lose much of its idiosyncratic expression, in order to appeal to Western consumers. A mention is made of how African currencies previously had been replaced by European. In the final segment, the film comments on the position of black Africans themselves in contemporary Europe and North America. Footage is seen from a Harlem Globetrotters basketball show, of the boxer Sugar Ray Robinson, and a jazz drummer intercut with scenes from a confrontation between police and labour demonstrators. Lastly the narrator argues that we should regard African and European art history as one inseparable human culture."

        "content": "In her 2006 book Chris Marker, film studies professor Nora M. Alter connects the ambition of the film to Chris Marker's tendency to promote upcoming or obscure artists, in attempts to avoid that their works are overlooked or forgotten. She notes how the objects in Statues Also Die are shown almost as if they were alive: \"Marker's camera treats all subjects in front of its lens without differentiating between humans, statues, animals, landscapes, architecture, or signs. The magic of cinema both imbues  inanimate objects with life and carries out the mortification of living subjects,\" something she also connects to the footage of the dying gorilla. Alter further writes that as the film asserts that colonialism is responsible for the \"disenchantment and demystification\" of African culture, Statues Also Die \"illustrates the process whereby a religious fetish is transformed into a commodity fetish by Western civilization.\""

Marker, who knew Resnais, offered to make the film together, because it would be more \"fun and enjoyable\". Both embarked on the adventure of the chief operator Ghislain Cloquet.\nAccording to Resnais, the original intent was not to make an anticolonial film, but only a film about African art. However when the filmmakers started to do research, they were struck by the fact that African art was exhibited at the ethnological Mus\u00e9e de l'Homme, and not the Louvre like art from elsewhere. As research continued, the disintegrating effects of colonialism became more prominent in the filmmakers' approach to the subject."

Produced by Venu Chettiar and V. Mohan, the film stars Rajinikanth, Sarath Babu, Jayalaxmi and Shoba. It marks Mahendran's directorial debut and is partly based on Uma Chandran's novel of the same name, which was serialised in the Tamil magazine Kalki in 1966. Mullum Malarum tells the story of Kali (Rajinikanth), a winch operator of a cable trolley who dotes on his sister Valli (Shoba) since they were orphaned, and clashes with his boss Kumaran (Sarath Babu).\nMahendran read only part of the novel, and developed the screenplay as he wanted, making a visually-focused film without formulaic Tamil cinema conventions he disliked such as melodrama, overacting, excessive dialogue and duets. Since Mahendran had no previous directing experience, cinematographer Balu Mahendra, who was already an established director, assisted him with the screenplay, dialogue, camera angles, casting and editing. Principal photography lasted for about 30 days, taking place primarily in Sringeri, Karnataka, though some scenes were also filmed in Ooty, Tamil Nadu. The film was edited by D. Vasu, and the soundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraaja.\nMullum Malarum was released on 15 August 1978. Although it opened to tepid box-office earnings, positive reviews from critics and favourable word of mouth in later weeks helped make it a success with a theatrical run of over 100 days. The film received praise primarily for Rajinikanth's performance, Balu Mahendra's cinematography, Ilaiyaraaja's music, Mahendran's writing and establishing Tamil cinema as a \"visual medium\". It won the Filmfare Award for Best Film \u2013 Tamil, the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Film and Rajinikanth won the Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize for his performance.\nMullum Malarum became a breakthrough for Rajinikanth as an actor and a milestone of Tamil cinema for focusing prominently on visuals and realism without the formulaic Tamil cinema conventions that Mahendran disliked. He continued following this style in all his later films. The film's success inspired a Malayalam remake titled Venalil Oru Mazha in 1979, a Telugu remake titled Seethamma Pelli in 1984, and a Hindi version titled Pyari Behna in 1985."

        "content": "Orphaned at a young age, Kali and his sister Valli grew up on the streets and were street performers. Kali played the drums and Valli perched herself atop a pole balanced by an older boy. Kali frequently gets angry at people whom he thinks lack empathy for the socially or financially deprived. As adults, the siblings live in a hilltop village where Kali works for a powerhouse in the valley below. From a shed in the village, he operates a winch for a cable trolley which ferries employees to work. The powerhouse's new divisional engineer, the rule-abiding but fair Kumaran, notices Kali offering free rides to unauthorised townspeople. When he orders the passengers out, citing rules of operation, Kali becomes angry and stops the trolley half-way downhill. Kumaran shrugs off this act with a knowing smile.\nOn a nearby canal's bank, Valli meets a young woman, Manga, who, along with her mother, has arrived from a drought-stricken town, Ilaiyangudi. The mother is looking for work, and both women are hungry\u2014Manga ravenously so, a fondness for food becoming one of her primary characteristics. Valli feeds and shelters them for the night, and asks Kali about allowing them to use the vacant house next door. Meanwhile, Kali roughs up his fellow employees whom he suspects of snitching on him to Kumaran. Kali is given a final warning by Kumaran as a prelude to serious disciplinary action.\nWhile Kali is at work, Manga appears, picks up his watch and teasingly declares she will run away with it. A chase ensues, taking them through the woods and into the river. Waist-deep in the water, Kali retrieves the watch and rushes back to the shed. During his absence, a child living in the valley has needed medical attention. After the emergency alarm at the shed has rung for several minutes, a passerby steps in to operate the winch. The child is transported back in the trolley and dispatched to a hospital. The following day, Kumaran suspends Kali from his job for ten days for gross misconduct.\nThat evening, Kali goes to the nearby Mullimalai to assuage his anger at Kumaran among the Badagas, joining them in singing and dancing. While staggering back home drunk, Kali passes out on an unlit street. A truck drives over his left arm, which is amputated at a city hospital. As a result, Kumaran regretfully fires Kali since he can no longer perform his job adequately with one arm. At Valli's prompting, Kali and Manga agree to marry; they have a simple wedding ceremony held at the local temple. Kumaran attends and brings a present of cash, which Kali rejects, but Manga accepts.\nKumaran becomes attracted to Valli. After determining her willingness for marriage, he requests permission from Kali who asks him to return the following day. Later that day, Kali corners Murgesan, a local grocer who is known for flirtatious behaviour, and offers him his sister's hand in marriage. An engagement ceremony for Murgesan and Valli is arranged. At the ceremony, Manga angrily interferes in the main ritual, which makes Kali furious at his wife. He physically assaults her repeatedly, but Manga remains firm in her opposition.\nThe next day, Manga convinces Kumaran and Valli to marry without Kali's knowledge, but he accosts their wedding party on its way to the temple. Kali accuses his sister of abandoning him because of his handicap. Valli is filled with guilt and rushes into his arm. Kali reminds the onlookers that he remains the most important man in his sister's life. Although he still dislikes Kumaran, Kali's self-esteem is restored, and he offers his blessings for the marriage."

        "content": "Film critic Naman Ramachandran likened Kali's relationship with Valli to how flowers need thorns for protection. According to critic Baradwaj Rangan, the title Mullum Malarum can be interpreted in two ways: \"the thorn and the flower\", which describes Kali and Valli; and \"even a thorn will bloom\", which foreshadows how Kali softens at the end. Mahendran considered the latter to be the real meaning of the film's title. S. Rajanayagam, author of the 2015 book Popular Cinema and Politics in South India: The Films of MGR and Rajinikanth, described Kali as the thorn and flower in the film; he characterised Kali as an \"angry young man with a kind heart\" who does not admit mistakes, despite having committed acts such as breaking car headlights and allowing people to ride the trolley, in violation of the powerhouse's rules. He noted that films like Mullum Malarum stereotype the poor as \"all that is pristine and traditional\", and leave the \"overall socio-economic system\" which made them poor unchallenged, but within this system, \"the hero will be 'richer' in terms of his moral uprightness\". Journalist Kavitha Muralidharan wrote that most of Mahendran's films show characters with contrasting personalities, citing the docile Valli and the garrulous Manga in Mullum Malarum as examples. Regarding this, Mahendran said, \"I only show them as they are in real life\".According to film historian Yves Thoraval, Mullum Malarum explores \"the extreme Oedipal possessiveness of a married brother for his younger sister\". Thoraval said this was a recurring theme in Indian films starting with Bahen in 1941. Ramachandran noted that Kali, like Rajinikanth's character in Bairavi (1978), is responsible for his sister's welfare. Unlike Bairavi, the siblings in Mullum Malarum are not separated; this leads Kali's protectiveness of Valli to the brink of obsession. Ramachandran regarded egotism as one of Mullum Malarum's central themes, identifying Kali as the alpha male of his community. According to an article published in Cinema Vision India, the film stresses \"that people change\u2014and they must\". Ramachandran noted that when Kali's arm is amputated, he feels helpless and emasculated, and Kumaran becomes an easy target. Kali refuses to see the benefits of his sister marrying a wealthy and educated man, even when Manga asks for his consent, but sees the error of his ways when Valli abandons her wedding party to join her brother: \"My sister has shown all of you that I am the most important person in her life. I need only that happiness for the rest of my life. And it is with that pride and arrogance that I give my permission for my sister to marry\". Writing for Frontline, Venkatesh Chakravarthy noted that the film ends with Kali relenting to Valli's desire to marry the man she wishes but not before he tells Kumaran that he still dislikes him, \"which makes the film open-ended with a feel that life goes on\"."

During its third or fourth week of release, positive magazine reviews and favourable word of mouth spread; Mullum Malarum became a commercial success, with a theatrical run of over 100 days. Chettiar later apologised to Mahendran, who in turn thanked him for letting him make the film.After watching the film and being impressed with Rajinikanth's performance, his mentor, director K.

In December 2013, The Times of India said that with this film, Rajinikanth \"dispelled whatever doubts remained about his acting ability\". Rajinikanth himself considers Mullum Malarum one of his five most favourite films and Mahendran his favourite director.Mullum Malarum was remade in Malayalam as Venalil Oru Mazha in 1979, in Telugu as Seethamma Pelli in 1984 (despite the dubbed Telugu version in 1979) and in Hindi as Pyari Behna (1985). \"Kali\" (alternatively, Kaali) became Rajinikanth's most-frequent onscreen name; his characters in Kaali (1980), Kai Kodukkum Kai (1984) and Petta (2019) also shared that name. In October 2015, director Pa. Ranjith said that Rajinikanth's characterisation in Mullum Malarum was a \"lesson\" of sorts for him, and the actor's character in Ranjith's Kabali (2016) was influenced by Kali in Mullum Malarum. The film's score has been regarded as one of the best of Ilaiyaraaja's career by commentators; the songs \"Senthazham Poovil\" and \"Raman Aandalum\" in particular, remain hugely popular. The latter was used in the climax sequence of Petta."

He takes out a couple of them with his superior skills, but is shot down from a hanging ladder in the helicopter trying to rescue him.  He washes up on the shores of Goa unconscious and is rescued by Shirley (Sasikala), who brings him to her doctor aunt (Sowcar Janaki).\nWhen he wakes up, he realizes that he is suffering from amnesia and has a few flashes of sculptures and a karate class, but does not recognize them. Meanwhile, a local rowdy has been harassing the doctor and her niece. The man manages to thwart their next attack easily, which makes him believe that he might be trained in martial arts. Since the man has enraged the rowdy, the doctor pleads with him to marry her niece for her own protection. He does so and thwarts another attack from the rowdy during their wedding.\nRight after, he decides to leave for Madras to find his identity with his new wife in town. Soon they find out that the earlier flashes he had are of the sculptures in Connemara Hotel and he used to be a regular there. After getting the bank account number he has used previously in the hotel, he visits the bank and is once again surprised to find out that he was a regular to the bank too and has a locker with a large amount of money, multiple passports of him and a hand gun.\nWhile leaving the bank, he is attacked by an unknown assailant in the lift but he once again successfully maims the assailant and escapes, but leaves a shocked witness. His bank locker contents along with his martial arts skills make him believe that he might have been involved in gangs before and decides to surrender to police but is talked out of it by his wife.\nVijay (Prabhu) and Jaya (Khushbu) are part of a wedding band. The man decides to uncover another one of his image flashes and tries to locate the karate class. In one such class, the instructor recognizes him, but guides him towards a singer Disco Shanti and tells him that he might be in danger. Another group of assailants attack him, and Vijay and Jaya are caught in the chaos. Believing Vijay to be helping the man, they kidnap Jaya and demand the surrender of the man, but Vijay and the man team up to rescue Jaya, which makes Vijay pledge to help the man in his quest.\nThe man then goes to talk to the singer, but is soon recognized and is shot at. The singer helps him escape and gives him a phone number to contact but is seriously wounded. He contacts the number and barely escapes another attempt on his life, but manages to meet the person who the singer referred to, which happens to be Nithyanandam, the Deputy Inspector General of Police.\nHe finally learns of his true identity. His name is Vetrivel, and he was happily married to Lalitha (Amala Akkineni), and was an undercover IPS officer who teamed up with the DIG to bring down a notorious hit man Zinda (Salim Ghouse). Unable to find any information about Zinda's whereabouts, they devise a plan to make Vetri go undercover and make him a bigger and more dangerous hit man than Zinda, hoping Zinda would get in touch with his fiercest competitor. The plan works, and soon Zinda and Vetri become friends. But soon, Zinda learns about an undercover police officer in his gang through a spy and kidnap Lalitha to oust the spy. Vetri breaks his cover to protect Lalitha, but she is shot and killed, and Vetri is chased (the opening in the movie), but escapes barely.\nVetri puts the pieces back together and uncovers a plot by Zinda to assassinate a very popular priest, Baba Appaji (Janagaraj) when he goes to meet up with the singer. Vijay and Vetri thwart his plans, but Zinda still manages to escape. To avenge this,Zinda kidnaps both Vijay's and Vetri's wives and sends them a photographic evidence of the kidnap. But Vetri and Vijay soon find the location with the background signboard in the photo, rescue their wives, and arrest Zinda.\nAwaiting Zinda's presence in the courtroom for his trial, they are surprised to see an unknown man being presented in the trial as Zinda. This makes them think that the DIG may be the spy who swapped Zinda out and rushes to his house to confront him, but finds him murdered in the arms of his crying wife. Suspicions still exist, and Vetri and Vijay find that the real spy is the DIG's wife, and they confront her. She shows them a lot of cash and asks them to let her go. Vijay sees this, and shoots and nearly kills Vetri for the money, and asks the wife to give him the money and leave. Believing that Vetri is finally dead, she rushes back to Zinda. But Vetri is alive, and this was a plan to make her lead them to Zinda's location. Vetri and Vijay follow her to a ship docked on the port, and go in to arrest Zinda. Zinda and his men are soon overpowered by the two-man fighting machine, but before he dies, he arms a bomb in the ship. Vetri and Vijay collaborate once and successfully disarm the bomb, thus relieving the port of the threat. The movie ends with both of them shaking hands."

        "content": "A man named Zakariya Mohammed is infected and brought to the Government Medical College, Kozhikode, where he suffers from the symptoms of an unknown virus and, after a few hours, dies. Geetha, who was taking Zakariya's CT scan, got infected by the virus. As nurses and doctors checked her blood pressure, the scale was going up and down which left the doctors there worried and confused. A nurse Akhila who treated Zakariya gets affected too. Slowly more cases are identified in the surrounding areas. Dr. Salim (a neurologist) while checking on Zakariya's father, Razak, notices symptoms related to poisoning and Japanese encephalitis and other such infections on Razak. Dr. Salim also asked Dr. Suresh Rajan to conduct a sample test for Nipah virus. The samples were collected from Suhana, sister of Zakariya.\nAs the death toll begins to rise, Dr. Suresh Babu confirms the unknown virus to be Nipah. Nipah spreads across Kozhikode and the neighbouring districts. Sister Akhila (the nurse who treated Zakariya), dies after a long battle with the virus and before she died, she wrote a letter to her husband. The film progresses with real life experiences of people who we are aware of when it has happened and also creates a backstory for each affected patient and generates an interest in the narration.\nIn an emergency situation, a team of medical practitioners and healthcare professionals, led by the Health Minister of Kerala C. K. Prameela and District Collector Paul V. Abraham IAS, camp in Kozhikode to tackle the crisis. There is an attempt made to justify that this is not a bio-weapon used by any country or organisation. While the film is ending, the film pays tribute to scientists, medical professionals, hospital staff, volunteers and the people who came forward to support the team to solve the virus attack. Health minister, C. K. Prameela announces Kozhikode Nipah virus free. In the end, it is shown that Zakariya saw a flying fox (a breed of bats) that was on the ground. He went there and before coming in contact with the bat, he took a picture of the bat for his Instagram story."

        "content": "Memoirs of a Geisha is a 2005 American epic period drama film directed by Rob Marshall and adapted by Robin Swicord from the 1997 novel of the same name by Arthur Golden. It tells the story of a young Japanese girl, Chiyo Sakamoto, who is sold by her impoverished family to a geisha house (okiya) to support them by training as and eventually becoming a geisha under the pseudonym \"Sayuri Nitta.\" The film centers around the sacrifices and hardship faced by pre-World War II geisha, and the challenges posed by the war and a modernizing world to geisha society. It stars Zhang Ziyi in the lead role, with Ken Watanabe, Gong Li, Michelle Yeoh, Youki Kudoh, Suzuka Ohgo, and Samantha Futerman.\nThe film was produced by Steven Spielberg (through production companies Amblin Entertainment and DreamWorks Pictures) and Douglas Wick (through Red Wagon Entertainment). Production was split between southern and northern California and a number of locations in Kyoto, including the Kiyomizu temple and the Fushimi Inari shrine. It was released as a limited release in the United States on December 9, 2005 and a wide release on December 23, 2005, by Columbia Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures, with the latter receiving studio credit only.\nThe film garnered polarized reviews from critics worldwide and was moderately successful at the box office. It was also nominated for and won numerous awards, including nominations for six Academy Awards, and eventually won three: Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design. The acting, visuals, sets, costumes, and the musical score (composed by Spielberg's long-time collaborator John Williams) were praised, but the film was criticized for casting some non-Japanese actresses as Japanese women and for its style over substance approach. The Japanese release of the film was titled Sayuri, the titular character's geisha name."

Chiyo is taken in by Kayoko Nitta, known as \"Mother\", the proprietress of a local okiya; Satsu, deemed too unattractive, is sent to a brothel instead. Chiyo also meets \"Granny\" and \"Auntie\", the other women who run the house; Pumpkin, another young girl; and the okiya's resident geisha, Hatsumomo.\nPumpkin and Chiyo soon begin their education to become future geisha. Hatsumomo, seeing Chiyo as a potential rival, immediately treats her with abuse. Hoping she will run away, Hatsumomo tells her where she can find Satsu in the red light district. They make plans to run away the following night. When Chiyo returns to the Okiya in the middle of that night, she stumbles upon Hatsumomo and her illicit boyfriend, Koichi. As the rest of the okiya wakes from the noise, Koichi runs away and Hatsumomo tries to frame Chiyo for stealing to distract from her affair. Mother begins to severely beat Chiyo who screams her innocence and yells that she saw Hatsumomo with a man. Mother orders Auntie to restrain Hatsumomo and checks between her legs for proof she was recently having sex. She rubs her wet fingers in front of Hatsumomo before slapping her in the face. Mother tells Hatsumomo that geisha are not free to love and that she will never see that man again. \nThe next night, when Chiyo tries to escape via the rooftops, she falls and is injured. Due to her accumulating costs, Mother stops investing in her geisha training and instead makes her a menial servant to pay off her debts. Satsu flees Kyoto and Chiyo never sees her again.\nOne day, while crying on a bridge, Chiyo encounters Chairman Ken Iwamura. He buys her a shaved ice dessert and gives her his handkerchief and some money to cheer her up. Touched by his kindness, Chiyo resolves to become a geisha so that she might become a part of the Chairman's life.\nSeveral years later, Pumpkin debuts as a maiko under Hatsumomo's tutelage. Shortly afterwards, Chiyo is taken under the wing of Mameha, one of the district's most prominent geisha, who persuades Mother to reinvest in Chiyo's geisha training, promising to pay her twice over after her debut. Chiyo becomes a maiko and receives the name Sayuri. At a sumo match, she is reintroduced to the Chairman, but attracts the attention of his gruff business partner Toshikazu Nobu.\nThanks to Mameha's efforts, and in spite of Hatsumomo's scheming, Sayuri rises in popularity, attracting the attention of many men\u2014including Dr. Crab and the Baron, Mameha's own danna. In a bidding war for Sayuri's deflowering ceremony, as part of her becoming a full geisha, the winning bid is a record-breaking amount from Dr. Crab, 15,000 yen. Mother immediately names Sayuri as her adopted daughter and the heiress to the okiya, crushing Pumpkin and enraging Hatsumomo.\nUpon returning home from the ceremony, Sayuri finds a drunken Hatsumomo in her room, where the latter has found the Chairman's handkerchief. This leads to a fight between them, in which Hatsumomo eventually starts a fire in the okiya. The building is saved, and Hatsumomo is banished from Gion.\nSayuri's successful career is cut short by the outbreak of World War II. The Chairman relocates her to the safety of the countryside, where she works for a kimono maker. After the war ends, Nobu asks Sayuri to help him impress an American Colonel who could approve funding for their business. She reunites with Mameha, who reluctantly agrees to help her impress the Colonel, as well as Pumpkin, who is now working as an escort.\nSayuri travels with Nobu, the Chairman, Mameha, Pumpkin, and the American soldiers to the Amami Islands. The Colonel propositions Sayuri, but she rejects him. Nobu confronts her after seeing this and confesses his desire to become her danna. Sayuri devises a plan to have Nobu catch her being intimate with the Colonel so that he will lose interest, and enlists Pumpkin's help to do so. However, Pumpkin brings the Chairman instead. When confronted, Pumpkin declares it her revenge for Mother adopting Sayuri instead of her. Disheartened, Sayuri gives up on her pursuit for the Chairman.\nAfter returning to Gion, Sayuri is summoned to a nearby tea-house. Expecting Nobu, she is instead surprised to see the Chairman. He confesses his feelings for Sayuri, admitting he always knew of her identity but refused to interfere with Nobu's feelings out of respect, and that he himself arranged for Mameha to become her mentor. Sayuri is finally able to confess her love to the Chairman and they share a kiss."

One day, a poor man, and a friend of Sathyam, loses his college-going daughter in a road accident. Sathyam and his allies learn that she was assaulted and killed by some goons. They ask Shiva's friend ASP Chandrashekar to help, but he's helpless as there is no proper evidence against the goons, who have an influential background. Sathyam takes justice into his own hands by killing the goons and making it look like an accident. Chandrashekar becomes aware and warns them against their actions, as he is worried about the consequences.\nJanatha Garage became popular for those seeking justice for the underprivileged. Shiva marries and has a son Anand. One day Mukesh, a powerful and corrupt entrepreneur, visits and warns Sathyam to stop interfering in his business. A few days later, Shiva and his wife are ambushed and killed by Mukesh's men. Chandrashekar asks Sathyam to give up his work for Anand's sake. Instead, Sathyam gives him to Suresh, Anand's maternal uncle, so he will be safe.\nAs an adult, Anand is an environmental science graduate and activist in Mumbai, with the same fighting spirit as Sathyam, worrying Suresh. Anand and Suresh's daughter Bujji fall in love with each other, delighting her parents. Anand meets Anu, a fellow student, and scolds her for using firecrackers during Diwali, but the two become friends. Anand gets into a fight with a powerful local MLA over environmental rights.

He looks up Anand's family, and brings Suresh and his family to Sathyam's house, revealing Sathyam and Anand's connection. Afraid for Bujji's safety, Suresh tells Anand to choose either Bujji or Janatha Garage. Choosing his father's family, Anand and Bujji tearfully say goodbye, and she marries someone else. Raghava and Riya leave Sathyam's house because of their uncultured lifestyle creating a ruckus with Anand and the family. Anand reconnects with Anu, revealed to be Chandrashekar's daughter. Anu tells Anand that she's attracted to him, and they fall in love with each other.\nSeveral bomb blasts occurred in Hyderabad. Bose, one of Sathyam's closest allies, loses his fianc\u00e9e in the blasts. Soon after, Bose is found dead, with police believing he committed suicide. When the police chief tells Chandrashekar to close the bomb blast case, he asks Janatha Garage for help. Anand tracks down the goons responsible for the blast and, in the process, discovers Bose was killed by Raghava. Bose found out that Raghava and Mukesh planned the blasts to undermine Janatha Garage's government influence. Sathyam decides that even though Raghava is his son, he can't live. Janatha Garage finds Mukesh and Raghava's hideout, beating up their men to get to them. Anand kills Mukesh; cornered, Raghava pleads for mercy, but Sathyam arrives and kills Raghava without remorse.

It stars an ensemble cast consisting of Jeff Bridges, Cynthia Erivo, Dakota Johnson, Jon Hamm, Cailee Spaeny, Lewis Pullman, and Chris Hemsworth. The plot centers on six strangers and an employee at the El Royale, a hotel located along the California\u2013Nevada border, who arrive with dark personal secrets that eventually intersect on a fateful night in the late 1960s. The film explores themes on morality, faith, and redemption, with the state border and other visual elements symbolizing the concept of right and wrong.\nGoddard began writing the spec script for the film in November 2016, and compiled a list of songs into his screenplay. After telling major studios to avoid buying the script if they could not buy the licenses for each piece of music, he sold it to 20th Century Fox in March 2017. Principal photography started in January 2018 with cinematographer Seamus McGarvey and finished in April. The El Royale hotel was built entirely on a studio set in Burnaby, Canada, under the supervision of production designer Martin Whist, who had envisioned designing a perfectly symmetrical hotel. Additional filming took place in the United States. During post-production, editing was completed by Lisa Lassek and the musical score was composed by Michael Giacchino.\nBad Times at the El Royale's marketing efforts included posters, trailers, and television advertisements, stylized to evoke nostalgia of the noir genre and to make the movie stand out against other films in theaters. The film premiered in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on September 22, 2018, and released on October 12 in the United States. The film underperformed at the box office, grossing $31.9 million against a $32 million budget, and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its ensemble cast, cinematography, and soundtrack, but criticized its pacing, runtime, character beats, and were polarized on Goddard\u2019s screenplay. It received various awards and nominations, most notably at the 45th Saturn Awards, for its writing, acting, cinematography, and music."

In 1959, Felix O'Kelly hides a money bag under the floorboards of his room. His accomplice arrives and shoots him dead. A decade later, Catholic priest Daniel Flynn, singer Darlene Sweet, salesman Laramie Seymour Sullivan, and hippie Emily Summerspring arrive at the hotel, now run solely by heroin addict Miles Miller, and book separate rooms.\nUpon checking into the honeymoon suite, Laramie begins removing wiretaps but unexpectedly finds a second set as well. After stealing the hotel's master key, he discovers a secret corridor where every room can be observed through one-way mirrors and filmed with a camera. Laramie sees Darlene singing, Daniel removing the floorboards of his room, and Emily holding a young woman captive. \nIn the parking lot, Laramie calls into the FBI, revealing himself to be Special Agent Dwight Broadbeck. He is instructed by J. Edgar Hoover to focus on his mission of collecting the surveillance materials the FBI had planted and ignore the 'kidnapping'. Believing the mission has been compromised, Dwight is also told to prevent the guests from leaving. To do so, Dwight disables all their cars.\nDaniel invites Darlene to join him for dinner in the hotel lounge. There, Darlene says she is practicing for a performance in Reno and Daniel reveals his memory is deteriorating. While he is getting drinks, she sees him spiking her beverage and she knocks him unconscious with a bottle. \nMiles later finds and revives Daniel, telling him that he wants to undertake a confession but Daniel refuses. Miles, looking for the missing master key, leads Daniel to the secret corridor, explaining that he used to regularly film intimate encounters that he had to send to his superiors. Miles also admits to having withheld one incriminating film of a deceased public figure who had been kind to him. \nWhen Daniel leaves to evaluate said film, Miles witnesses through the one-way mirror Dwight attempting to rescue Emily's hostage, who is revealed to be her younger sister, Rose. When Emily kills Dwight with a shotgun, it also shoots out the mirror, revealing the corridor and injuring Miles.\nBefore these events, Emily had forcibly removed her sister from a dangerous cult, led by Billy Lee. In the present, Rose secretly calls Billy to tell him where she is. A witness to Dwight's murder, Darlene tries to escape but fails due to his tampering with her vehicle. \nDaniel arrives and reveals to her that he is Dock O'Kelly, imprisoned since a bank robbery in 1959. Recently paroled, he arrived in disguise to retrieve the money hidden by his brother Felix. Due to Dock's failing memory, he picked the wrong room and tried to drug Darlene to gain access to hers. To gain her trust, he offers to split the cash with her. After retrieving the money, Billy and his cult arrive and take the pair, Emily, and Miles hostage.\nIn a flashback, Billy tells his cult how people are forced to choose sides and, as an allegory, gets Rose to fight another girl for the chance to sleep with him as Emily watches nearby. In the present, a compliant Rose watches Billy as he interrogates the group and finds the film, which he realizes is more valuable than the money. He forces Emily to choose a color in a game of roulette between her and Miles, and kills her when she loses. Before Billy completes another round of roulette, Dock attacks him, a melee ensues, and a fire begins to spread. \nWhen Darlene implores Miles to pick up a gun and help, it is revealed that he served in the Vietnam War as a sniper and killed 123 people. A defiant Miles kills Billy and his followers, but a distraught Rose stabs him in the stomach before being shot by Dock. Darlene convinces \"Father Flynn\" to absolve Miles of the guilt over his wartime actions before he dies. They then toss the film into the fire and leave with the money. Sometime later in Reno, Dock attends Darlene's soul performance at a nightclub."

On December 21, 2018, a 10-minute \"extended preview\" scene of the film was released, with Collider questioning the studio's decision, writing that it was \"something they should have done back in October, but it is what it is\".The Hollywood Reporter's Chris Thilk analyzed the marketing techniques of Bad Times at the El Royale, summarizing the fact that the studio was \"[betting] on noir nostalgia\" to attract audiences. In what he believed was \"established neon-heavy branding\", Thilk said each of the released posters was \"hinting in some way toward the nature or arc\" of each character. On the trailers, he wrote that viewers were unable to \"describe what's going\" and were left \"raising lots of questions\". After discussing the initial footage being released at CinemaCon and San Diego Comic-Con, where filmgoers were also allowed to enter a lottery for the chance of seeing an exclusive screening of the film, Thilk tackled the various clips, featurettes, and television spots produced to advertise the film. In his summary, he wrote that the marketing campaign \"promoted a strong cast and a wicked sense of humor\", and that 20th Century Fox \"has embraced that to sell it to those looking for something a bit different at the theater\"."

It was attended by its crew, cast, and fellow filmmakers and actors including Manny Jacinto, Alvina August, Stefan Kapi\u010di\u0107, Bill Pullman (the father of actor Lewis Pullman, who stars in the film), and Joss Whedon along with 20th Century Fox chairman and CEO Stacey Snider and vice chairman Chris Aronson. At the opening, Whedon gave the film positive feedback, having previously worked with Goddard on writing The Cabin in the Woods, and said of the finished product, \"It's gritty, it's hard-edged, but it's adorable.\" In Austin, Texas, the film was one of the last screened projects at Fantastic Fest and later had its world premiere in Spain, out of competition, at the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival.The film's runtime of 141 minutes was chosen after negative scores appeared during test screenings where audiences were given a viewing of the film with a shorter runtime. It was initially scheduled for release on October 5, 2018, but was later postponed to October 12. This shift was reportedly made to avoid competition with the October 5 releases of Venom and A Star Is Born. After it opened in theaters, the film was chosen to introduce the 13th Rome Film Festival, serving as its Italian premiere. At the ceremony, Goddard said his film contained \"parallels to the #MeToo movement\" on the topic of abusing power."

The film was directed by Aristomenis Tsirbas who conceived it as a hard-edged live action feature with photo-real Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) environments. The close collaboration with producing partner and investor Snoot Entertainment redirected the project to become fully animated and appeal to younger audiences. The film features the voices of Evan Rachel Wood, Luke Wilson, Brian Cox and James Garner (In his last major film role before his death) among others.\nIt premiered on September 8, 2007 at the Toronto International Film Festival and was widely released in the United States on May 1, 2009 by Lionsgate and Roadside Attractions.The film was originally shot in 2D but was made in such a way that a second camera could be added to the film. After the film was shown at festivals and distributors showed an interest in it, a small team was hired to render the entire film again from the perspective of the second camera for a true 3D effect. It won the Grand Prize for Best Animated Feature at the 2008 Ottawa International Animation Festival."

        "content": "Mala and her friend Senn are young creatures of an alien race that inhabits Terra, a peaceful, near Earth-like planet that is part of a star system in the Milky Way galaxy and has a rich and advanced culture.\nOne day, a large, mysterious object partially blocks the Terrian sun, piquing the Terrians' interest. Mala, who is inventive and headstrong, goes against the Terrian rules that ban the development of new technologies without the approval of the ruling council and creates a telescope. She takes it outside the city and uses it to view the object. Recon ships emerge from the large object, come down to the city and start abducting Terrians. Some willingly offer themselves to the spaceships mistaking them as their new \"gods\".\nAfter Mala's father, Roven, is abducted, she lures a ship into a trap, causing it to crash. She saves the pilot, a human named Lieutenant James \"Jim\" Stanton. After his personal robot assistant, Giddy, warns Mala that Jim will die without oxygen, absent on the planet, she scavenges suitable plants and creates a tent in which Jim can breathe. In exchange, Giddy teaches her human language. Jim awakes and finds out his ship is damaged beyond repair. Giddy tells Mala why the humans have come: centuries beforehand, both Mars and Venus were terraformed and colonized by humans for their natural resources. 200 years later, the planets demanded independence from Earth, to no avail. This dispute escalated into a violent interplanetary war that rendered all three planets uninhabitable. The mysterious object in the sky is The Ark, a generation ship containing the remnants of the human race, traveling for several generations in search for a new home. They arrived at Terra, and gave it its name. Mala agrees to fix Jim's ship, so she can go with him to save Roven. When Mala, Jim, and Giddy return to the crash site, they discover the ship has been moved.\nThe trio tracks the ship to a secret underground military facility where the elders and Doron, the leader of the council, secretly retain the military technology from prior conflicts. After infiltrating the facility and fixing the ship, they fly to the Ark. In it, the commander of the human army, General Hemmer, takes over the Ark in a coup, and declares war on Terra. Mala finds Roven, but gets detected. A fight with the guards starts, in which she gets captured and Roven, while trying to keep the humans away from him with a laser, unintentionally causes a decompression that kills him and the men. Hemmer tells Jim his goal is to turn Terra into a new Earth. He will drop the Terraformer, a huge machine capable of creating an Earth-like atmosphere onto the planet's surface, annihilating the Terrians in the process. To test his loyalty, Hemmer creates a scenario in which Jim has to choose between killing Mala or his younger brother Stewart. Jim saves Stewart, while discreetly ordering Giddy to rescue Mala by breaking the glass and help her escape back to Terra. Hemmer orders Jim to join the space-fighters in charge of defending the Terraformer, while he personally supervises the mission within the machine.\nDoron and the Terrian elders allow Terrians, along with Mala and Giddy, still under Jim's order to protect her, to defend their planet with their stockpile of military tech, but are hopelessly outnumbered with an unexpectedly large amount of opposing fighters. The humans drop the Terraformer onto the surface and it begins to poison the planet with oxygen. As the machine is close to completing its objective, Jim finds Mala fighting Stewart. Realizing the immoral decision in killing the Terrians, he turns back to destroy the Terraformer with missiles, killing a betrayed Hemmer. Mala, Giddy and Stewart steer away from the fireball in time, but Jim's critically damaged ship fails and is consumed. The Terraformer's scorched skeleton collapses, leaving only one leg standing in its wake.\nAt the end of the movie, Humans and Terrians agree to live in peace. Having abandoned the Ark, they establish a colony on the planet, where a statue of Jim is erected in honor of his heroism."

Battle for Terra received uncharacteristically little marketing for a wide release film. The television campaign consisted of a small number of television spots on Cartoon Network and a handful of network television ads in select markets. Awareness for the film on its opening weekend was subsequently little to non-existent. This strategy of having a disproportionately small advertising campaign for a wide release was employed only one other time a year earlier with the film Delgo. The results for that film were disastrous as the $40 million Delgo grossed a mere $694,782 on 2,160 screens. The lower costing Battle for Terra fared considerably better by taking in more than twice as much revenue ($1,647,083) on roughly half as many screens (1,159) and continued on to gross $6 million internationally. Battle For Terra opened May 1 in the United States against 2 other wide releases: X-Men Origins: Wolverine (4,099 screens) and Ghosts of Girlfriends Past (3,175)."

He learns that fellow student and former childhood friend of his, Rachel Kushner, has been diagnosed with leukemia and is forced by his parents to befriend her in her time of need. Despite an awkward first encounter on Rachel's staircase, with neither of them truly wanting the other's company, Greg manages to strike up a conversation about her pillow collection. She comes to find his quirky personality and honesty endearing.\nGreg introduces Rachel to his \"co-worker\" Earl (who tells Rachel that Greg avoids calling people his friend out of fear they will not reciprocate), with whom he makes short films parodying famous film titles. Despite Greg's reluctance, Earl shares their collection with her, which she finds entertaining. As Rachel begins her chemotherapy treatment and subsequently loses all of her hair, Greg begins spending less time on schoolwork and more time with and caring for her by entertaining her to lift her spirits. Though Rachel suffers through her treatment and seems to get worse and worse, Greg, who often breaks the fourth wall, assures viewers that she does not die in the end.\nMadison, a pretty girl at school, convinces Greg and Earl to make a film dedicated to Rachel, and Rachel persuades Greg to apply to a local college. Greg continues to ignore schoolwork, and eventually school altogether, in order to finish the film. After realizing that her chemotherapy is doing more harm than good, Rachel opts to discontinue her treatment. Greg and Rachel have a heated argument over her choice where Greg accuses Rachel of giving up on herself and in return Rachel points out his unwillingness to do anything selfless unless he is told to do so. He leaves, devastated that he can no longer help her.\nIn a rage, Greg confronts Earl, blaming him for the events leading to the end of his friendship with Rachel. Earl in turn admonishes Greg's inability to care and sympathize for anyone but himself, before ultimately punching Greg after the latter dares him to. Later, Earl gives Greg a heartfelt testimonial for Rachel's film before letting him know that he is finished with their friendship. Greg's admission to the college he planned to attend is later rescinded due to his poor grades.\nLater in the year, Greg learns that Rachel is back in the hospital and is dying. His mother encourages him to visit her. Madison invites Greg to the prom, but at the last moment, he decides to go to the hospital instead. During the journey there, Greg is asked by the limousine driver if he loves the girl he is going to see, a question he finds himself unable to answer. He brings his iPhone and a portable projector and places a corsage around Rachel's wrist before running the film he made for her on the front wall of her room. Rachel is moved to tears by the film, but falls into a coma shortly after viewing it and dies approximately 10 hours later. Greg admits to the viewer that he lied about Rachel not dying, as he \"didn't think she would.\"\nAt her shiva, Greg is comforted by Rachel's mother and they grieve together. Greg and Earl rekindle their friendship. During the funeral, Greg sneaks into Rachel's room, where he finds a card from her stating that she wrote to Greg's college and explained that he missed school for her sake. It also states her wish for Greg to take any of her possessions that he pleases. He finds several intricate carvings within her books depicting scenes of her with Greg and Earl. Greg leaves with one of the books containing a personal carving and his favorite of Rachel's pillows.\nSome time later, Greg writes his story of his time with Rachel and mails it to the college along with the film he made for her, with a warning that \"the last person who saw this immediately went into a coma and DIED.\""

The production company Indian Paintbrush and producers Steven Rales and Jeremy Dawson then got involved. Having never read or written a script before, Jesse Andrews adapted his own New York Times best-selling novel. Andrews' screenplay appeared on the 2012 Black List of Hollywood's best unproduced screenplays. Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon became interested in the project after reading a leaked copy of the script. He had worked as a production assistant and second-unit director for Nora Ephron, Martin Scorsese and Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, and had been looking to direct his first personal film, to express his own cinematic vision and his grief for his late father.The film was shot over a four-week period for an estimated budget of under $5 million. Principal photography began on June 13, 2014, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; they started filming high school scenes on June 16. Cinematographer Chung-hoon Chung shot the film digitally using Arri Alexa cameras with prime and anamorphic lenses in a widescreen 2.35:1 aspect ratio. A Pittsburgh native, writer Jesse Andrews' family home in Point Breeze was used as Greg's house in the film. Rachel's house was located in Squirrel Hill, and Earl's house was in Braddock. Other locations included Schenley High School (closed since 2008), The Andy Warhol Museum, Copacetic Comics in Polish Hill, and a street corner in West Oakland, which served as an ice cream shop. The Criterion Collection lent its library of classic films for use in the book-and-DVD store in the film.Brian Eno scored the film using a combination of previously unreleased recordings and a few original compositions; Nico Muhly composed the music for the beginning high school sequence and final credits. Filmmakers Edward Bursch and Nathan O. Marsh made 21 stop-motion animated and live-action short films to represent Greg and Earl's classic film parodies, including the final short film made for Rachel set to Brian Eno's \"The Big Ship\". Differing from the novel, director Gomez-Rejon felt the final film should reflect Greg's artistic growth and express his love for Rachel in an abstract way, using color, texture, and shapes, similar to the work of Stan Brakhage."

Hitchhiking to tiny Bandera, Texas, he finds the idyllic home of his youth in the Texas Hill Country decrepit and owned by a poor but covetous old man.  Penniless, Jeff couldn't buy it if he wanted to.\nA shattered memory to Jeff, the tiny framehouse is nonetheless the dream home for hardscrabble Wes Merritt and his wife Louise, who are painstakingly saving Wes's meager cowhand wages at a nearby ranch to buy the small spread. Wes immediately recognizes Jeff as a former champion rodeo rider and introduces himself, then helps Jeff gets a job alongside him. Wes, who has competed in some local rodeos, wants Jeff to help him improve his skills so he can chase big prize money in the professional circuit.\nWes enters a local event without telling Louise. When he does well, he joins the bigtime, with Jeff as his trainer and 50-50% partner. Louise, who grew up with nothing, is against the idea, because it puts Wes in harm's way and means abandoning both their securely rented home and plans for a permanent one.  She ultimately consents after extracting a promise from Wes he'll quit when they have saved enough for the ranch house.\nWes is a big success from the start.  It rapidly becomes clear he loves the riding and the fame more even than the money he's raking in.  As Louise becomes acquainted with rodeo life, she becomes increasingly disenchanted. Jeff's friend Booker Davis, once a champion competitor himself, is now a crippled old man with little to show for his efforts. When banged-up veteran circuit rider Buster Burgess is gored and killed by a bull, he leaves a bitter widow, and Louise unable to bear watching her husband compete. Still, Wes presses on, refusing to quit when they have enough for the house. As he grows an ever more swelled head and parties his winnings away, Louise gets fed up and starts staying home in their trailer even at night.\n\nMatters come to a head when wealthy man-hungry circuit hanger-on Babs makes a second play for Wes. The first had ended with a swift kick to her curvy rear from Louise.  This time she pours a drink on Babs's head to cool her off, but ends up merely leaving emptyhanded in a huff. Jeff, who had come to be attracted to Louise and earlier that evening had pitched her some sincere woo, asks her if she could love another man. Even though she too had warmed up towards him - after initially growing to despise him and the effect he had had on her husband and the couple's simple stable life together - she proclaims her loyalty to Wes.  Babs get left behind, and Wes sends Jeff packing, tarring him a freeloader and barking that he is tired of taking all the risks and giving Jeff half of the prize money.\nRebuffed, Jeff impetuously returns to the rodeo despite not being in shape. He gains back Wes's respect by immediately doing well in the first couple of events his very first time out. He then shows his old stuff in bronc riding, but his foot gets stuck in his stirrup when he is finally thrown; twisted and dragged violently on the ground, he is then crushed when the horse falls and rolls over him. Louise rushes to his side in the first aid shack and seeks to comfort him.  Reciting his mantra - There never was a horse that couldn't be rode; there never was a cowboy who couldn't be throwed - a final time, he dies in her arms from a punctured lung.  Arriving moments later, Wes learns of Jeff's grisly end from Louise, quits the rodeo, and leaves arm-in-arm with her for Bandera...with Booker and his young daughter in tow as cowhand and company."

        "content": "Micky Ward is an American welterweight boxer from Lowell, Massachusetts. Managed by his mother, Alice Ward, and trained by his older half-brother, Dicky Eklund, Micky became a \"stepping stone\" for other boxers to defeat on their way up. Dicky, a former boxer whose peak of success was going the distance with Sugar Ray Leonard in 1978, has become addicted to crack cocaine. He is being filmed for an HBO documentary he believes to be about his \"comeback\".\nOn the night of an undercard fight in Atlantic City, Micky's scheduled opponent Saoul Mamby is ill, and a substitute is found in Mike Mungin who is 20 pounds heavier than Micky, a huge difference in professional boxing, constituting two or three weight classes. Despite Micky's reservations, his mother and brother agree so that they can all get the purse and tell Micky that the fighter is out of shape and has ring rust.  They arrive at the fight and find that the substitute fighter is actually ready for the fight and in top shape, and soundly defeats Micky. Micky retreats from the world and forms a relationship with Charlene Fleming, a former college athlete who dropped out and became a bartender.\nAfter several weeks, Alice arranges another fight for Micky, but Micky is concerned it will turn out the same. His mother and seven sisters blame Charlene for his lack of motivation. Micky mentions he received an offer to be paid to train in Las Vegas, but Dicky says he will match the offer so he can keep training and working with his family. Dicky then tries to get money by posing his girlfriend as a prostitute and then, once she picks up a client, impersonating a police officer to steal the client's money. This is foiled by the actual police and Dicky is arrested after a chase and a fight with them. Micky tries to stop the police from beating his brother and a police officer brutally breaks his hand before arresting him. At their arraignment, Micky is released, but Dicky is sent to jail. Micky washes his hands of Dicky.\nOn the night of the HBO documentary's airing, Dicky's family, and Dicky himself in prison, are horrified to see that it is called Crack in America and depicts how crack addiction ruined Dicky's career and life. Dicky begins training and trying to get his life together in prison. Micky is lured back into boxing by his father, who believes Alice and his stepson Dicky are bad influences and did more damage to his career than good. The other members of his training team and a new manager, Sal Lanano, persuade Micky to return to boxing with the explicit understanding that his mother and brother will no longer be involved. They place Micky in minor fights to help him regain his confidence. He is then offered another major fight against an undefeated up-and-coming boxer. During a prison visit, Dicky advises Micky on how best to work his opponent, but Micky feels his brother is being selfish and trying to restart his own failed career. During the actual match, Micky is nearly overwhelmed, but then implements his brother's advice and triumphs; he earns the title shot for which his opponent was being groomed.\nUpon his release from prison, Dicky and his mother go to see Micky train. Assuming things are as they were, Dicky prepares to spar with his brother, but Micky informs him that he is no longer allowed per Micky's agreement with his current team. In the ensuing argument, in which Micky chastises both factions of his family, Charlene and his trainer leave in disgust. Micky and Dicky spar until Micky knocks Dicky down. Dicky storms off, presumably to get high again, and Alice chides Micky, only to be sobered when he tells her that she has always favored Dicky. Dicky returns to his crack house, where he says goodbye to his friends and heads to Charlene's apartment. He tells her that Micky needs both of them and they need to work together. After bringing everyone back together, the group goes to London for the title fight against welterweight champion Shea Neary. Micky scores another upset victory and the welterweight title. The film jumps a few years ahead, with Dicky crediting his brother as the creator of his own success.\nThe real-life brothers banter as the end credits run."

        "content": "Mark Wahlberg as Micky Ward: Wahlberg elected to star in the film due to his friendship with Ward, with whom he shares an inner-city working class Massachusetts upbringing in a family with eight siblings. Wahlberg also was a huge fan of Ward's, calling him a \"local sports hero\". The actor was also attracted to the film's central theme, an ordinary person in \"an against-all-odds story\", which he previously explored in Invincible (2006). To mimic Ward's habits and mannerisms, Wahlberg had him \"on set, watching me every single day\". During pre-production, the Ward brothers temporarily moved into Wahlberg's home. To add to the film's realism, Wahlberg refused a stunt double and took real punches during the fight scenes, which resulted in him nearly getting his nose broken a couple of times. Wahlberg underwent a strict bodybuilding exercise regimen, dedicating over four years of training to obtain a muscular physique to convincingly play Ward. \"The last six movies I did I was also secretly preparing for The Fighter at the same time\", the actor continued, \"so I would leave three hours early for work and go to the gym and spend three hours there. I would bring the trainers with me on every movie that I did.\" His uncertainty over the film's development was overruled by his persistence to get the film made. \"There were certainly times where I would wake up at 4:30 in the morning, you know, my trainer would ring the bell, and, 'Oh God', I'm like, 'I better get this movie made'. You know, 'Kill somebody if I don't get this movie made.'\" Wahlberg hired Freddie Roach as his boxing trainer, helping the actor model Ward's specific fighting style. The last two years of Wahlberg's training resulted in the construction of a \"dream gym\" in his house for daily use, with a personal boxing ring. He received additional boxing preparation from Manny Pacquiao.\nChristian Bale as Dick \"Dicky\" Eklund: After both Brad Pitt and Matt Damon dropped out due to scheduling conflicts, Eminem was talked to and considered for the role of Eklund, but he ultimately wasn't cast due to recording conflicts with his music. Wahlberg suggested Bale for the role after meeting the actor at a preschool their daughters both attended. Given Eklund's drug addiction, Bale had to lose weight, which he found easy as he had lost 63 pounds in 2003 for The Machinist (2004). Bale researched the part by taking notes on Eklund's mannerisms and recording conversations for the character's distinctive Boston accent. Director David O. Russell believed Bale's task involved far more than mimicry. \"Dicky has a whole rhythm to him, a music. Christian had to understand how his mind works.\" Russell and Eklund were both impressed by Bale's dedication to staying in character throughout filming. Bale went on to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor at the 83rd Academy Awards for his performance.\nAmy Adams as Charlene Fleming, Ward's real-life girlfriend and wife: Russell said of the actress: \"There are very few things that a director can have at his disposal better than an actress who's dying to break type and is extremely motivated to break type. Amy was extremely motivated to play a sexy bitch, and that's who the character of Charlene is. ... She said: 'As long as it happens between action and cut, I'll do anything.\" And I said: 'That's my kind of actress.' I loved that she had that attitude.\" Adams was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress at the 83rd Academy Awards.\nMelissa Leo as Alice Eklund-Ward, mother of both fighters and their seven siblings, all sisters. Leo won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress at the 83rd Academy Awards.\nJack McGee as George Ward, Micky's father.\nFrank Renzulli as Sal Lanano\nMickey O'Keefe as himself, a Lowell, Massachusetts police sergeant who was Ward's real-life trainer. O'Keefe, who had never acted, was hesitant at first, but Wahlberg told him he could do it because as a police officer, he has to act and think fast on his feet.\nJenna Lamia as Sherri \"The Baby\" Ward\nBianca Hunter as Cathy \"Pork\" Eklund\nErica McDermott as Cindy \"Tar\" Eklund, one of Mickey and Dickey's sisters\nSugar Ray Leonard as himself, making a cameo appearance as a guest commentator at the Ward/Mungin match\nKate O'Brien as Mickey's sister, Phyllis Eklund\nAlison Folland as Laurie Carroll, Micky's ex, who she shares a daughter Kasie"

Legally the French may not fish within a three-mile limit of the British coast, and vice versa, and breaches of this rule are the cause of frequent spats between the two countries. In this instance, hot-headed Cornish harbour-master Nat Pomeroy confronts Lanec Florrie, an equally redoubtable widow in charge of an otherwise male crew, from a Breton port. Beneath all the bluster and posturing however, there is a mutual understanding and respect between the two communities.\nWidower Nat's daughter, Sue Pomeroy, has been friends since childhood with local boy Bob Tremayne, and their eventual marriage has been taken as a foregone conclusion.  During a visit by the Cornish contingent to Brittany a wrestling match is arranged between Bob and Lanec's son Yan, during which Yan breaks a bone, to the concern of Sue.  Yan is attracted to Sue and begins actively to woo her, with great success.  Sue is torn between her own attraction to Yan and her unspoken commitment to Bob, a situation which leads to increased friction between the two communities.  However, when war-related danger ensues, both sides realise that their unity in common cause against the mutual German enemy, and that it is more important than petty squabbles.  Bob is called up to serve in the British navy, and in a showdown conversation with Yan before he leaves, the two agree that Sue must be allowed to follow her own heart.\nYan comes to Cornwall to also serve in war duties.\nWith most men absent, a loose sea mine drifts into the Cornish harbour and Lanec bravely mans a ship to net it and tow it out, making her a local hero and easing the tensions. She eventually pushes Sue and Yan to marry, which they do without Pomeroy's consent."

They also take great pleasure in tormenting their cook, Mrs. Blatherwick, a former military cook who declares that there will be \"snow in August\" before the family is put to rights. Besides their father, the only one the children will ever listen to is Evangeline, the family's uneducated but beautiful and sweet-natured scullery maid.\nOne day, Cedric discovers multiple references for a \"Nanny McPhee\" throughout the home. That same night during a storm, while the children cause havoc in the kitchen, Cedric opens the door to reveal a hideous woman, who introduces herself as Nanny McPhee. \nWith discipline and a little magic, she transforms the family's lives. The children, led by Simon, try to play their tricks on her, but after failing, they gradually start to respect her and ask her for advice. Each time the children learn a lesson, one of Nanny McPhee's facial defects magically disappears. Over time, the children become more responsible, helping their clumsy father in solving the family problems, making Nanny McPhee less and less needed.\nThe family is financially supported by Cedric's late wife's domineering and short-sighted aunt, Lady Adelaide Stitch, who demands custody over one of the children. She first wants second-youngest daughter Chrissie, but Evangeline volunteers to go and Adelaide agrees, assuming she is one of the daughters. She also threatens to reduce the family to poverty unless Cedric remarries within the month.\nDesperate, Cedric turns to vile and frequent widow, Mrs. Selma Quickly. The children assume from reading fairy tales that all stepmothers are terrible women who treat their stepchildren like slaves; together, they sabotage Mrs. Quickly's visit, and she leaves, angry at Cedric. \nAfter the financial rationale for the marriage is explained to the children, they realise their mistake; the children appease Mrs. Quickly by confessing they were to blame for ruining her visit. Mrs. Quickly, intrigued when she hears about Adelaide's wealth and status, reconciles with Cedric and agrees to marry him. However, Mrs. Quickly deliberately breaks baby Aggie's beloved rattle, which previously belonged to their late mother.\nAt the gaudy wedding, the children pretend there are bees (inspired by the way Quickly told them to \"behave,\" and baby Aggie repeating the word but pronouncing it as \"beehive\"), chase the guests, and start a food fight using banquet pastries. Cedric swiftly understands his children do not like the bride and, recognizing that she is not right for him or his children, joins in the commotion himself. Mrs. Quickly calls off the marriage and storms off in anger. \nWhen it seems that Adelaide's marriage deadline is missed, Lily suggests that Cedric marry Evangeline; the other children reveal to Adelaide that she is not, in fact, their sister. Evangeline and Cedric resist at first, but then realize their feelings for each other and agree to marry, satisfying Adelaide's conditions for maintaining her financial support but causing her to faint from shock. \nNanny McPhee, now fully beautified, magically makes it snow in August, transforming the wedding scene and changing Evangeline's clothes into a wedding dress, and restores Aggie's rattle. She then leaves surreptitiously, in accordance with what she told the children on her first night: \"When you need me, but do not want me, then I must stay. When you want me, but no longer need me, then I have to go.\""

        "content": "The film begins at Kali Yuga when Sage Bhadra is conducting a massive penance when Vishnu emerges. He invests him to be seated on his head as per his oath on Treta Yuga 's Rama Avatar. Thus, Vishnu transforms into Rama, seating Sita on his lap, with Lakshmana on the left and Shanka & Chakra on either side. After several centuries, Dhammakka, a devout servant, locates the whereabouts of idols in an anthill of Bhadrachalam. She looks after it with profound commitment and prays for an advent to build a temple. \nThe tale shifts to Nelakondapalli, where Kancherla Gopanna falls in love with his cousin Kamala. On the eve of her birthday, Gopanna inadvertently transgresses by caging a parrot as a gift. Agnihotraavadhanlu, Kamal's father, detests their bond because of Gopanna's financial status and fixes a prosperous alliance. Nevertheless, it calls off as astrologers predict jail access is inevitable for the one that splices Kamala. Despite this, Gopanna knits Kamala for which his maternal uncles Madanna & Akkanna, the true-blue ministers of Tanisha of Golkonda attend. They accompany Gopanna, introduce him to the Empire, and he acquires his credence. Thus, he delegates him as Bhadrachalam's Tehsildar, terminating his brother-in-law Matte Saiheb. \nForthwith, Gopanna forwards with Kamala when Matte Saiheb begrudges but waits for a shot. Gopanna hinders the crimes & barbarities therein. So, the blackguards backstab him, whom Dhammakka shields. After revival, he advances for thanksgiving her when witnessing Dhammakka's constant dedication; Goppana switches to an avid follower of Rama. By this, Vishnu walks from Vaikuntha in the form of Rama and steps at Parnasala with Sita & Lakshmana. At which, Anjaneya startles to view them again, and then Rama proclaims it's time for a tremendous accomplishment. \nConsequently, Gopanna pledges to construct a temple for which he relinquishes his luxuries and resides under a tree with pregnant Kamala until its completion. Gopanna wakes spiritually publicly, collects assets, excluding Tanisha's taxes, and seeks his approval. Anyhow, the plot of Matte Sahib & his men falls short, and they snatch the tax amount. At that time, Kabirdas, whose means of life is Rama's chanting arrives. Spotting his eternal devotion, Gopanna affirms him as his mentor, and he preaches him with Srirama Taraka Mantram. Kabir announces that Rama has already consented to emplacement and fixes an auspicious time. \nYears roll by, Gopanna triumphs in constructing a sublime temple, and the Lord blesses him with a son, Raghunatha. Kabir lands on the eve of the temple inauguration, but orthodox Brahmins expel him. Yet, with his idolization, Kabir proves his divinity. Tragically, Raghunatha dies while dropping into a well when Anjaneya is in Panchmukhi, recouping him on the mandate of Rama. Then Kabir states that the incident spread that region's holiness. Following this, Anjaneya is enthralled, beholding Rama's glory at the temple and calling Gopanna Ramadasu. Ergo, Kabir publicly nobilitates Gopanna Sri Ramadasu. as the Lord's ordinance in his dream.\nMeanwhile, the heels tactically forge and accuse him of squandering govt funds and apprehend him. Hereupon, Kabir comprehends he is seeking a penalty for imprisoning the patriot. During the trial, Ramadasu encounters Tanisha lionizing his deed as sacred; as a result, he is behind bars in a secluded prison and subjected to torment. Ramadasu invokes the Lord with reverence, humility, eagerness, and notwithstanding anger, but in vain. Ultimately, he implores Sita, which stirs her, and she pleads with Rama to secure him. Rama & Lakshmana set foot at Golkonda and vanishes, clearing the debt. Tanisha is under a dichotomy when Kabirdas irradiates him with the fact. Therefore, Tanisha learns the eminence of Ramadasu and the foul play of knaves and acquits him. However, Ramadasu collapses due to the absence of Rama's holy appearance. With misery & great difficulty, he reaches Bhadrachalam, associating with Kamala. Now, Ramadasu solicits, and Rama arises by granting salvation, which he denies. At last, Ramadasu asks for a boon to make his soul immortal at his feet in the temple when the Lord bestows it. Finally, the movie ends happily, with Ramadasu's soul blessing the devotees who have been visiting the temple till today."

Keeravani received extremely positive appreciations for their respective works in this film. Particularly, Nagarjuna's performance was highly praised by most of the critics.\nTelugu movie reviewing website idle brain gave 3.75 out of 5 and wrote,  \"He (Nagarjuna) did extremely well in the title role. His histrionics in the last reel where \u2018Dasaradhi\u2019 song comes are extraordinary. Nobody knows how Sri Ramadasu looks like and whenever we think about Sri Ramadasu in the future, the image of Nagarjuna becomes the visual aid. The first half of the film is decent. The emotional graph starts growing up from \u2018Antha Ramamayam\u2019 song and goes to the peak by the film reaches climax. The second half of the film is very good. The plus points of this film are Nagarjuna's histrionics, Keeravani's music, K Raghavendra Rao's direction of J. K. Bharavi's script. Sri Ramadasu film comes as fresh breeze when we are bombarded with routine and formula flicks. I recommend this devotional flick to everybody.\"Another reviewing website India glitz gave an extremely positive review and praised Nagarjuna's performance, in particular, stating, \"Nagarjuna is a revelation in a role that calls for nuances and skill. It is no romp for him. He has put in hard labor both in terms of looks as well as body language. The triumph of this role lies in the fact that Nags got the subtleties right. An award is just round the corner for him. Keeravani in a sense is the other hero of the movie. There are 19 songs, each dipped in his own devotion to his art. Like in Annamaiya (Annamayya), he has delivered more than he has been asked for. His songs create the right mood and momentum for the film to proceed. The bhakti rasa is splendidly brought out.\"The Hindu praised Nagarjuna and M. M. Keeravani and wrote, \"Nagarjuna steals the show as Ramadasu. After playing the role of his lifetime in Annamayya, Nagarjuna comes up with another winner in Sri Ramadasu. Nag (Nagarjuna) once again proves he is equally at ease portraying epic characters apart from playing mass, sentiment and glamor roles.  The highlight of the film is the performance of Nagarjuna in the prison episode. Keeravani gives a musical chartbuster and both songs as well as background score and re-recording is excellent and takes the audience into a musical journey. Graphic works are superb.\""

Raynal stars in the film, her first as a director; she had previously worked for several years as a film editor, most notably for films in \u00c9ric Rohmer's \"Six Moral Tales\" series (she was, reportedly, the youngest professional editor in France at the time). The film's title, which literally translates as Twice and is sometimes translated into English as Twice Upon a Time, refers to the occasional repetition of scenes or actions.\nGloriously shot in Black and White by Cinematographer Andr\u00e9 Weinfeld, Deux fois is one of the most notable of the Zanzibar Films, a group of feature-length experimental work made from 1968 to 1970 with the financing of Sylvina Boissonnas. It is also considered a landmark of Feminist filmmaking. Raynal made the film in nine days in Barcelona, Spain, casting a man she had met there, Francisco Viader, as one of the leads.\nRegarding the film, the influential French critic Serge Daney wrote: \"She put in her film the visionary crazed coldness of major paranoiacs. We also find the murderous, painful madness of Fritz Lang's great films, in which all the fiction is reduced to sketchy outlines, arabesques, leaving almost no trace.\"\n\n\n== References =="

He helps Chandrasekhar become a doctor and builds a local hospital. On the day it opens, Chandrasekhar comes back home with his lover Kausalya, also a doctor. Both express their wish to marry and settle abroad, which upsets Balaraju, leading to their separation.\n25 years later, Chandrasekhar, a successful doctor in London, tells the story to his son Abhiram and daughter Indu. Abhiram decides to go home to Balaraju and attempt a reconciliation. He meets his friend, Bunny, at the airport and goes to the village on Bunny's bike the next day. On the way, he witnesses a cockfight organised by Bangari and Baachi; he gets the help of Balaraju to pardon Bangari and get Baachi arrested. Abhiram then introduces himself as a student from London who came here to learn agricultural practices and martial arts. He particularly impresses Balaraju's family when he saves a child's life and so is allowed to stay with them.\nBalaraju's granddaughter Satya comes back from Hyderabad. Abhiram is surprised to see Satya's cultured behaviour and traditional attire, as Bunny and Abhiram previously met her in a pub in Hyderabad. She is equally surprised to see him; his cell phone contains photos showing how she spent her time at the pub. Abhiram blackmails Satya with the photos, but she then asks Bangari to get Abhiram's cell phone by telling him that Abhiram is blackmailing her. Their collective efforts fail, and Baachi is also dragged into the affair.\nA fight happens between Abhiram and Baachi, deepening their rivalry. To get rid of Bangari, Balaraju arranges Chitra's marriage. Satya tells Bangari about this who then kidnaps Chitra. Abhiram chases him, saves Chitra and gets Bangari arrested. Satya finds Abhiram's phone and finds out his true identity. Abhiram offers to help Balaraju renovate the hospital he built with his father's assistance; Balaraju accepts the offer. Abhiram finds out that Satya has his phone when he goes to call his father. She deletes the photos of her. After learning that she knows the truth, Abhiram does a deal with her. They fall in love with each other.\nLater, Chitra, now Abhiram's friend at the house, tells him why Bangari was expelled from the house. Bangari and Chitra love one another and Balaraju does not approve of it, as Bangari is rather spoilt and drinks too much. Frustrated and intoxicated, Bangari enters Chitra's room and tells her of his attempt to rape her so as to marry her. However, Balaraju expels him from the house after catching him. Balaraju\u2019s brother-in-law and his son, Rajendra, who plan to set up a special economic zone manufacturing beer, release Bangari from jail. Abhiram's father sends the advanced equipment to Hyderabad, which Bunny and Bangari receive. Bangari attacks Bunny and seizes the equipment. Abhiram stops Bangari and his men and reveals his identity. Bangari realises what he has done and reconciles with Balaraju. The equipment is unloaded at the hospital.\nIndu too visits Balaraju's house. Satya gets engaged to an American NRI doctor. However, she tells Abhiram that she would die if she doesn't marry him. He decides to break up with her and upon hearing this, Bangari reveals Abhiram and Indu's identity to Balaraju, who orders Abhiram's and Indu to leave the house.\nLater, Abhiram gets a phone call from his father who plans to return to the village. Suddenly, Baachi kidnaps Indu. An injured Abhiram manages to save her, but gets shot by Baachi. Bangari arrives and Abhiram prevents Baachi from being harmed by saying that Baachi too is a family member. Chandrasekhar comes to the hospital and operates on Abhiram. When Abhiram regains consciousness, Balaraju welcomes him, Indu and Chandrasekhar back into the family. The film ends with Abhiram marrying Satya and Bangari marrying Chitra, also coinciding with Balaraju and Baby's anniversary."

Unfortunately, Wallace has run out of cheese, and is unable to get more given that the shops are shut. Believing that the moon is made of the stuff, they build a rocket, and, with some initial difficulty, launch into space. When they land, as they look for a place to sample the lunar landscape, they encounter a coin-operated robot resembling an oven on wheels. Wallace inserts a coin, but nothing happens. Some time after two leave their initial picnic spot, the robot activates and assesses the belongings and dishes left behind, taking some of them as clean-up.\nThe robot also discovers one of Wallace's skiing magazines as well, and suddenly develops a yearning to travel to Earth to ski there. As it further assesses the evidence of its new visitors, it repairs a discarded piece of the cheese landscape, issues a parking ticket for the rocket, and is annoyed by an oil leak from the craft. Discovering Wallace as the culprit, the robot sneaks up and is about to strike him with a clubbing baton, but the money Wallace inserted runs out, and it turns off. Wallace, unaware of any trouble, hits his head on the baton anyways as he gets up, but takes it as a souvenir, inserts another coin, and prepares to leave with Gromit.\nReactivating a bit later, the robot sees the two in their preparations. It hurriedly follows, hoping to travel with them to Earth. Wallace notices, and panics, assuming that the robot is angrily pursuing them for taking the cheese, and he and Gromit retreat into the rocket. They attempt to start the engine, but they discover they've neglected to light the rocket's fuse in their panic. Unable to climb the ladder to get into the rocketship, the robot cuts into the fuselage with a can opener. As it fumbles around in the dark, it accidentally knocks a fuel line open and ignites the vapours. The resulting explosion throws the robot clear, but also starts the engine and the rocket safely lifts off anyways.\nThe robot sadly and angrily resigns to its inability to go to Earth, until it realises that the strips of fuselage it held onto could be fashioned into crude skis. As it now-happily carouses around the lunar landscape, the robot waves goodbye to Wallace and Gromit as they return home."

In 1985, Aardman Animations took him on before he finished the piece, allowing him to work on it part-time while still being funded by the school. To make the film, Park wrote to William Harbutt's company, requesting 1 long ton (1,000 kg) of Plasticine.\nThe block he received had ten colours, one of which was called \"stone\"; this was used for Gromit. Park wanted to voice Gromit, but he realised the voice he had in mind \u2014 that of Peter Hawkins \u2014 would have been difficult to animate. For Wallace, Park offered Peter Sallis \u00a350 to voice the character, and the actor's acceptance greatly surprised the young animator.Park wanted Wallace to have a Lancashire accent like his own, but Sallis could only do a Yorkshire voice. Inspired by how Sallis drew out the word \"cheese\", Park chose to give Wallace large cheeks. When Park called the actor six years later to explain he had completed his film, Sallis swore in surprise.Gromit was named after grommets, because Park's brother, an electrician, often mentioned them, and Nick Park liked the sound of the word. Wallace was originally a postman named Jerry, but Park felt the name did not match well with Gromit. Park saw an overweight Labrador Retriever named Wallace, who belonged to an old woman, boarding a bus in Preston. Park commented it was a \"funny name, a very northern name to give a dog\".\nAccording to the book The World of Wallace and Gromit, original plans were that the film would be forty minutes long, including a sequence where Wallace and Gromit would discover a fast food restaurant on the Moon. Regarding the original plot, Park said: The original story was that Wallace and Gromit were going to go to the Moon and there were going to be a whole lot of characters there. One of them was a parking meter attendant, which was the only one that remained \u2014 the robot cooker character \u2014 but there were going to be aliens, and all sorts. There was going to be a McDonald's on the Moon, and it was going to be like a spoof of Star Wars.\nWallace was going to get thrown into prison and Gromit was going to have to get him out. By the time I came to Aardman, I had just started doing the Moon scene and somebody told me, \"It's going to take you another nine years if you do that scene!\" so I had to have a check with reality and cut that whole bit out. Somehow, I had to tie up the story on the Moon and finish the film."

Gautham and his assistants follow Rajashekar, who happens to suffer from a heart attack midway and they admit him into a hospital earning his trust and Gautham lies to him, Sunanda and others that he was a driver in Dubai named Siddhartha aka Siddhu who was expelled from his job.. Upon Rajashekar's insistence, Sunanda deploys Gautham as their driver and he befriends Sunanda's eldest daughter and his cross-cousin Prameela whom he flirts with while Sunanda's second daughter Shashi suspects Gautham and his friend Paddu, Rajashekar's nurse who is aware of Gautham's story.\nGautham rescues Prameela from a man who is apparently a kidnapper while Sunanda discloses to Gautham that she is aware of who he is and warns him from doing anything with an intent to take her back to Raghunandan whom she refuses to forgive as the latter shot Rajashekar in his arm when in a fit of rage when they got married after eloping. Gautham saves Prameela from a suicide attempt and she divulges that she was trying to run away with Rohit, whom Gautham assumed to be the kidnapper. Prameela requests Gautham to bring Rohit to her as he is being forced to marry Neelamani, daughter of a fierce factionist Siddhappa Naidu, the very next day and Gautham obliges to her plea. Gautham and Paddu head to Siddhappa's village for Rohit but Shashi suspects that they have stolen something and inadvertently falls into their jeep and suffers from amnesia forgetting who she is. For the time being, Gautham introduces himself as her love interest whom she ran away with as her mother opposed their wedding. \nGautham and Paddu take Rohit with them but Siddhappa, his younger son and henchmen chase them and in an ensued scuffle, Shashi regains her memory. Gautham defeats Siddhappa's henchmen and takes Rohit away but Siddhappa meets Rajashekar and Sunanda at their residence, confronting them and demanding a compensation for the damage caused to her daughter and their reputation. Realizing the virtue of Siddhappa's elder son, Sunanda offers to get Shashi married to him and to avoid problems with Siddhappa's family in future, Rajashekar fires gautham. Shashi confesses to Gautham that she has been in love with him which is overheard by her cousin. Baddham Bhaskar, an affluent NRI and Siddhappa's nephew is invited to Sunanda's home as a guest and Sunanda explains to her assistant Murthy that Bhaskar was her assistant preceding to Murthy who ran away from the house after stealing an amount of \u20b92 Lakhs that used to go to Uganda where he bought a plot of land to cultivate but finding diamonds in it, became wealthy.\nGautham traps Bhaskar, who has a penchant for women and desires to marry Shashi and joins him as his assistant, entering Sunanda's residence with his support. Bhaskar's conspiracies to get close to Shashi are constantly thwarted by Gautham who takes Shashi to the railway station for eloping to Chennai apparently. Siddhappa's men arrive at the station after learning from Shashi's cousin about her love for Gautham but the latter thrashes them and Shashi perceives Gautham's true identity and his intentions. Rajashekar and family arrive at the railway station which Gautham has vacated using his influence and Rajashekar attempts to shoot Gautham. Gautham wonders that if Raghunandan was wrong at that time for shooting Rajashekar then why is the latter doing the same right now. Gautham narrates that after Sunanda left with Rajashekar, Raghunandan tried to shoot himself out of guilt but Gautham's father Hari resisted him and in an ensued struggle, Raghunandan accidentally shot Gautham's mother Pooja killing her but neither Gautham nor his father hated him for it as they know that he could never be wrong. \nRealizing their folly, Rajashekar and Sunanda retreat their anger for Gautham and his family and Sunanda chooses to reconcile with her father. Bhaskar, who vows vengeance, abducts Shashi using four of his men but Gautham and Paddu intervene and the former reconciles with Shashi as the latter has been upset with him for being hideous about the truth. Bhaskar perceives that the government of Uganda seized his wealth and he is left with just \u20b92 Lakhs. Sunanda arrives at Milan with her family and stands by Raghunandan in a board meeting hinting their reconciliation to her father and unanimously has Gautham recruited as the CEO of the company. \nBhaskar resumes his position as Sunanda's assistant as the family dines together and Raghunandan holds Gautham's hand with affection."

        "content": "In Mankulam, a small Tamil village in Sri Lanka, M. D. Shyama marries Dileepan and becomes pregnant. Amidst the backdrop of the Sri Lankan Civil War, Dileepan fights against the government with other men in the village as part of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). While romancing in the forest, the couple hears Sri Lankan Army troops approaching. Dileepan makes Shyama flee while he remains in the forest. Afterwards, the villagers begin fleeing to India, but Shyama is reluctant to join as she still hopes her husband will come for her. Her relatives convince her to go for her unborn child's sake, and they board a rickety boat, journeying through rough waters. An older man says that he has seen Dileepan with bullet wounds in the forest. Shyama wants the boat to turn around but it is too late. After arriving in Rameswaram (in Tamil Nadu, India), Shyama gives birth to a baby girl during refugee processing. However, she leaves behind the baby in order to return to Sri Lanka, hoping that her husband is alive and wishing to continue in his footsteps.\nNine years later in Chennai, a young girl, Amudha lives a happy life with her father, the writer Thiruchelvan (better known by his pen name Indira), her mother, a newscaster and the \"real\" Indira, and her two younger brothers, Vinay and Akhil. Amudha is close to her father while being more distant from her mother. On Amudha's ninth birthday, Thiruchelvan reveals to Amudha that she was adopted and her younger brothers are their biological children. Amudha is very disturbed after hearing the news and begins distancing herself from everyone else. Indira's father criticizes their decision, but Thiruchelvan and Indira are certain they have done the right move. Amudha asks her parents about her adoption. Nine years earlier in Rameswaram, Thiruchelvan, then a budding writer, often travels to a refugee camp and writes stories inspired by the people there. During one visit, Thiruchelvan sees a newborn baby girl and writes a short story about her. Indira is his neighbour, and has always been interested in him. Thiruchelvan wants to adopt the girl, but is not allowed to as a single man. He marries Indira and adopts the baby girl, naming her \"Amudha\" at Indira's suggestion. A few years later, Indira gives birth to Vinay and Akhil.\nStill dissatisfied, Amudha requests to meet her biological mother despite Indira's insistence that she can't be found. Amudha secretly goes to Rameshwaram with her cousin and finds her records. Shocked at her stubbornness, her family rushes there. Thiruchelvan gives in and agrees to take Amudha to Sri Lanka to find her birth mother. Leaving the two boys under the care of Indira's father, the trio travel to Sri Lanka and meet Dr. Harold Wickramasinghe, a Sinhalese friend of Thiruchelvan who guides them. Amudha's increasingly rude and impatient behavior towards Indira strains their relationship. During their stay, they observe the difficulties and violence that the civil war has brought. While walking in the jungle, Thiruchelvan and Wickramasinghe are captured by a group of LTTE cadres. Thiruchelvan immediately recites Tamil poetry and is identified as Indira by Pasupathy, the group's leader. Thiruchelvan explains his motives of coming to the country, mentioning the only evidence that he has regarding Amudha's birth mother is that her name is Shyama. Pasupathy arranges a meeting and says he will bring Shyama to the designated spot. It turns out that Shyama is Pasupathy's sister and a fellow LTTE cadre living in hiding.\nThe next day, Wickramasinghe, Amudha, Indira, and Thiruchelvan wait in a park to meet Shyama, but a battle breaks out there as the Sri Lankan army tries to destroy a nearby LTTE base. During their escape, Indira gets shot in her arm. After escaping and getting medical treatment, Amudha apologizes to Indira for her behavior and requests they return to India. The next day, the family leaves for the airport but Indira unexpectedly asks them to revisit the park. Shyama arrives just in time; after an emotional reunion, Amudha gives Shyama a photo album and asks her a series of questions which she only partially answers. As the meeting comes to an end, Amudha begs Shyama to come to Chennai with her but Shyama tearfully refuses, saying that she has work to do in Sri Lanka and they can only meet again when the country is at peace. Thiruchelvan, Amudha, and Indira hug each other as Shyama leaves, and a teary-eyed Amudha kisses her parents."

        "content": "Like other Mani Ratnam projects, the film began production with very little official publicity in early 2001 with the media covering the project as either Manjal Kudai (Yellow Umbrella) or Kudaigal (Umbrellas). The film was reported of a trilogy of films based on love and peace in the backdrop of war after Roja (1992), Bombay (1995) and Dil Se (1998). The film was originally conceived as a taut racy thriller that centres on a script based on a female leader of a guerilla group  \u2013 with Mani Ratnam later choosing to base the film on human relationships with the backdrop of the Sri Lankan Civil War. R. Madhavan was signed up to play a leading role in the film, with the venture becoming his third straight Mani Ratnam project after Alaipayuthey and the Mani Ratnam production, Dumm Dumm Dumm. For the role of Indira, Mani Ratnam considered casting Jyothika, Soundarya or relative newcomer Bhumika Chawla, before finalising Simran to portray the character. Madhavan and Simran thus shot for two films simultaneously together, as they had also been cast in K. Balachandar's Paarthale Paravasam as a married couple. Nandita Das was also hired for the film, making her debut in Tamil films, and in a later interview mentioned that the team shot for nearly thirteen hours a day. P. S. Keerthana, the second daughter of actors Parthiban and Seetha, was cast the child artiste in the film, while Prakash Raj was also hired to play a Sinhalese character. Mani Ratnam approached actor Vikram to make a special appearance as Keerthana's biological father in the film, but his refusal meant that J. D. Chakravarthy was later handed the role.The title of the film was finally announced as Kannathil Muthammittal (If the cheek is kissed) in July 2001, after a famous phrase from a poem written by Subramanya Bharathi. The shoot began in Chennai with a ten-day schedule in the Besant Nagar area. Parts of the film shown to be Colombo in the film were shot in Puducherry. Further schedules were carried out in the forests of Kerala to depict the base of the LTTE in northern Sri Lanka. As most of the cast were non-native Tamil speakers, dubbing artistes were used with actresses Sukanya and Deepa Venkat lending their voices for Nandita Das and Simran respectively. Furthermore, Mounika lent her voice for Easwari Rao's character, while Thalaivasal Vijay spoke lines for Chakravarthy."

It revolves around the growing tensions within a small convent of Anglican sisters who are trying to establish a school and hospital in the old palace of an Indian Raja at the top of an isolated mountain above a fertile valley in the Himalayas. The palace has ancient Indian erotic paintings on its walls and is run by the agent of the Indian general who owns it, a handsome middle-aged Englishman who is a source of attraction for the sisters.\nIn her autobiography, A Time to Dance, a Time to Weep, Godden, who grew up in India, describes an event that became an inspiration for Black Narcissus. While exploring the Indian countryside with friends one day, they came across a gravestone, covered with brush. When they cleared it away, all that was on the stone was the name \"Sister Ruth\". \nBlack Narcissus received acclaim for its technical mastery, with the cinematographer, Jack Cardiff, winning an Academy Award for Best Cinematography and a Golden Globe Award for Best Cinematography, and Alfred Junge winning an Academy Award for Best Art Direction.According to film critic David Thomson, \"Black Narcissus is that rare thing, an erotic English film about the fantasies of nuns, startling whenever Kathleen Byron is involved\"."

Several monks previously failed to start a school there; the general's agent Mr Dean describes the social and environmental difficulties the sisters will face. The ambitious Sister Clodagh is appointed Sister Superior and is sent with four other nuns: Sister Philippa for gardening; Sister Briony for the infirmary; Sister Blanche, better known as \"Sister Honey\", to teach lace-making; and the emotionally unstable Sister Ruth for general classes. Mr Dean is unimpressed and predicts the women will last only until the beginning of the monsoon.\nWhile setting up the convent, the sisters face difficulties with the old palace and also the local population, often clashing with the native caretaker, Angu Ayah. They have difficulty accepting a Hindu holy man in their grounds (the general's uncle) who spends all his time in meditation on one of the mountains. The sisters take in Kanchi, a local girl, to try and control her erratic behavior, and they also tutor the general's heir\u2014referred to as the Young General\u2014in Western culture prior to a trip to Britain. Ayah whips Kanchi for stealing, but the Young General stops her. He soon falls in love with Kanchi, creating a situation that Mr Dean compares to the tale of The King and the Beggar-maid.\nEach convent member begins experiencing ill-health and emotional problems caused by their surroundings. Philippa loses herself in the environment and plants the vegetable garden with flowers. Ruth, already highly strung, becomes increasingly jealous of Clodagh and obsessed with Mr Dean, leading her to renounce the order. Clodagh recalls a failed romance which prompted her to join the order. Honey's growing attachment to the local children ends disastrously after she gives medication to a fatally-ill baby. The child's death angers the locals, who blame and abandon the mission, putting further strain on the sisters. Mr Dean fails to persuade Clodagh to leave before anything else untoward happens.\nOne night Clodagh confronts the now-unstable Ruth, finding her wearing a modern dress she ordered to entice Mr Dean. Ruth escapes Clodagh's watch and finds Mr Dean. When he rebuffs her advances, she suffers a mental breakdown and returns to the mission, intent on killing Clodagh. When Clodagh rings the morning service bell, Ruth attempts to push her over the cliff edge. In the ensuing struggle, Ruth falls to her death. The mission leaves just as the monsoon season begins, with Clodagh's final request to Mr Dean that he tend Ruth's grave."

Film critic Dave Kehr has suggested that the final images of the film, as the sisters abandon the Himalayas and proceed down the mountain, could have been interpreted by British viewers in 1947 as \"a last farewell to their fading empire\"; he suggests that for the film-makers, it is not an image of defeat \"but of a respectful, rational retreat from something that England never owned nor understood\". The story in the film quite closely follows that of the book, which was published in 1939."

        "content": "Black Narcissus achieved acclaim for its pioneering technical mastery and shocked audiences at the time of release with its vibrant colour and the themes of the film. Audiences gasped at some of the scenes, notably the shot of the pink flowers which, shown on the big screen, was a spectacle at the time. The film's lighting and techniques have had a profound impact on later film makers, notably Martin Scorsese who used the extreme close-ups of the sisters as the inspiration for the treatment of Tom Cruise's character around the pool table in The Color of Money. Scorsese has said that the film, particularly in its last quarter, is one of the earliest erotic films. The film was one of his favourites as a boy and one of the greatest experiences he has had with film is viewing Black Narcissus projected on a massive screen at the Directors Guild in 1983. In Michael Powell's own view, this was the most erotic film he ever made. \"It is all done by suggestion, but eroticism is in every frame and image from beginning to end. It is a film full of wonderful performances and passion just below the surface, which finally, at the end of the film, erupts.\" The English film critic Peter Bradshaw, who put it on his list of the ten best films ever made, took Powell's statement further, and said that it was the most erotic film he had ever seen.In The Great British Picture Show, the writer George Perry stated, \"[Powell and Pressburger's] films looked better than they were \u2013 the location photography in Technicolor by Jack Cardiff in Black Narcissus was a great deal better than the story and lifted the film above the threatening banality.\" In contrast, the critic Ian Christie wrote in the Radio Times in the 1980s that \"unusually for a British film from the emotionally frozen forties the melodrama works so well it almost seems as if Powell and Pressburger survived the slings and barbs of contemporary criticism to find their ideal audience in the 1980s\". Marina Warner, introducing the film on BBC2 (on a nun-themed film evening, with Th\u00e9r\u00e8se), called it a masterpiece.\nThe film's resonance with populations exploring previously stifled sexual desires and expression extends beyond its contemporary milieu of women in the post-war era. Black Narcissus also influenced the themes and aesthetic of the ground-breaking gay experimental film Pink Narcissus, which portrays a series of pornographic vignettes in vivid colour as the fantasies of a prostitute between visits from his keeper. Although Pink Narcissus was lost in obscurity for some time, in recent years it has resurfaced as a cult classic, due in part to the vivid, fantastical aesthetic inspired by Black Narcissus.The look and cinematography of the 2013 Disney film Frozen was influenced by Black Narcissus. While working on the look and nature of the film's cinematography, Frozen art director Michael Giaimo was greatly influenced by Jack Cardiff's work in Black Narcissus."

However, the pressures of success cause her to nearly end her life by falling off a hotel balcony. She is saved by a young police officer, Kaz Nicol. Noni's team, including her mother, tells the media in a press conference that she fell by accident. Kaz, who has political ambitions, is not happy to be forced to lie to the media, and is initially cold to Noni. However, he later apologizes to her. Gradually, they connect and begin to fall in love, despite her mother's disapproval. Noni tells Kaz about the songs she has secretly written, and he is supportive of her creative ambitions. Noni decides to end the romantic relationship with Kid Culprit that her team has encouraged.\nIn spite of her team's attempt to cover it up, rumors persist that Noni attempted suicide, and her label tells Macy (who is also Noni's manager) that her record contract is conditional on a successful upcoming performance. However, during the performance, Kid Culprit sexually assaults and humiliates her, claiming that Noni attempted suicide because he'd broken up with her. He tries to strip Noni's clothes off on stage when Kaz rushes in to rescue her and punches Kid Culprit in her defense. Following this, Noni loses her record contract and is at a low point emotionally, so Kaz takes her on a trip to Mexico away from the spotlight where they enjoy each other's company. Noni gets rid of her old hairstyle in favor of her natural hair, and a trip to a local karaoke bar leads to Noni giving an emotional performance of \"Blackbird.\" The performance is uploaded to the internet and goes viral, causing Noni's mother and the paparazzi to find her. Macy tells Noni that the viral success of her performance has caused her record label to reconsider, and Noni agrees to return home. Kaz tells Noni he is not convinced that anything will be different than it was before, and their relationship is put on pause.\nNoni wants to add a song she has written to her upcoming album, but Macy refuses. The two fight about their relationship and Noni tells her mother that even after her suicide attempt, Macy continued to focus only on her career to the detriment of her happiness and mental health. Noni fires Macy as her manager. Meanwhile, Kaz has begun a political campaign and reflects on whether his career should take precedence over his personal happiness. Inspired by Kaz's honesty, Noni gives a television interview where she admits to having attempted suicide and says she is getting help. Noni prepares for her first live performance in London, and shortly before going onstage suddenly encounters Kaz, who has taken a flight there and expresses his love for her. Noni performs a song she has written to an enthusiastic audience. She brings Kaz onstage, tells him that she loves him too, and they embrace."

Rajamanickam agrees with the villagers, and asks his brother-in-law to withdraw. His brother-in-law vehemently refuses and the election heavily contested. Rajamanickam wins with a high vote difference and his brother-in-law hangs himself. Kayavaram portrays the suicide as heart attack, and promises revenge on Rajamanickam, effectlively severing their relationship.\nIn 2010, Vetrivel (Sasikumar) is a organic-fertiliser vendor, who lives in a nearby village with his parents Navaneetham (Ilavarasu), Saradha (Renuka) and brother Saravanan (Ananth Nag). Saravanan falls in love with his classmate Subha (Varsha Bollamma), the only daughter of Rajamanickam. Meanwhile, Vetrivel develops a liking for an agriculture researcher Janani (Miya).\nVetrivel urges his father to approach Rajamanickam with a marriage proposal between Saravanan and Subha for which Rajamanickam opposes citing caste differences. Vetrivel and Saravanan plan to kidnap Subha during a temple festival but the plan fails as they accidentally kidnap another girl Latha (Nikhila Vimal) by mistake. Latha is engaged to Arul (Rajesh Gopalan), son of Kayavarnam and her wedding was supposed to take place in a week. Vetrivel realizes his mistake and rushes back to the village to drop off Latha but her father commits suicide before her arrival thinking that Latha eloped with someone. She understands that it was Kayavarnam who behaved very rude towards Latha\u2019s father which made him to end his life.\nVetrivel marries Latha as she is helpless now. Vetrivel\u2019s parents accept Latha understanding her situation. Janani although disappointed, understands Vetrivel\u2019s situation and accepts his decision. Meanwhile, Rajamanickam plans to get his daughter Subha married to his relative but Vetrivel interferes and cancels the wedding talks. Finally, Rajamanickam decides to get Subha married to Arul with the hope of ending his long dispute with Kayavarnam. The wedding is arranged and Rajamanickam drops off Subha in Kayavarnam\u2019s house fearing Vetrival\u2019s intervention again. But Rajamanickam finds out that Kayavarnam has plans to ditch Subha after wedding as a means of revenge on Rajamanickam.\nRajamanickam understands his mistake and meets Vetrivel and agrees for Subha's wedding with Saravanan. On his way back, Rajamanickam is kidnapped by Kayavarnam. Meanwhile, Arul informs Subha that he does not want to marry her without her consent. Arul asks Subha to inform Saravanan about her whereabouts so that Saravanan can come and rescue her. Subha informs Saravanan and he arrives at the place but gets shocked to see Arul\u2019s henchmen there. It is revealed that it was a plan by Kayavarnam and Arul to kill Saravanan. Vetrivel also arrives there and he beats everyone and saves Saravanan and also saves Rajamanickam. Finally, Subha is married to Saravanan."

        "content": "Mouna Ragam ( transl.\u2009Silent Symphony) is a 1986 Indian Tamil-language romantic drama film written and directed by Mani Ratnam, and produced by G. Venkateswaran. The film stars Mohan and Revathi, with Karthik, V. K. Ramasamy, Ra. Sankaran, Bhaskar, Kanchana, Vani, Kalaiselvi and Sonia in supporting roles. It narrates the life of Divya (Revathi), a free-spirited college girl who is forced into an arranged marriage with Chandrakumar (Mohan) by her father (Sankaran). But, she still lives in the memory of her past lover Manohar (Karthik). The story follows Divya's inner conflict between holding onto her past and coming to terms with the present.\nThe film's development began when Ratnam began writing a short story tiled \"Divya\" with no cinematic plans until he finished it. Since production on his directorial debut Pallavi Anu Pallavi (1983) was delayed, he took a break for a month and developed \"Divya\" into a film script, which would eventually be renamed Mouna Ragam. Although Ratnam began work on the script during Pallavi Anu Pallavi, it languished in development hell and ended up becoming his fifth film. Mouna Ragam was the first film produced by Venkateswaran's Sujatha Films, and was shot primarily in Madras, with additional filming taking place in Delhi and Agra. The music was composed by Ilaiyaraaja, with lyrics by Vaali. P. C. Sreeram was the cinematographer, and the art director was Thota Tharani. The film was edited by B. Lenin and V. T. Vijayan.\nMouna Ragam was released on 15 August 1986. Despite opening to modest audiences, it became a box-office success, with a theatrical run of over 175 days, and Mani Ratnam's breakthrough. The film received critical acclaim; it won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil, and Ratnam received the Filmfare and Cinema Express Awards for Best Director in Tamil. Mouna Ragam also became a breakthrough in Karthik's career despite his role being a cameo. The film introduced techniques such as soft-focus shots, flare filters and backlighting, which became popular in Tamil cinema. It was remade in Hindi in 1992 as Kasak, and in Kannada in 1999 as Chandrodaya."

        "content": "Divya is a free-spirited college student from a conservative family in Madras. Her father Chandramouli has arranged for her marriage and tells Divya to come home early from college to meet Chandrakumar, the prospective groom. Uninterested in marriage, she deliberately arrives home late, hoping Chandrakumar will reject her, only to find him patiently waiting for her. Though respectful of him, she arrogantly mentions various reasons to make him dislike her but, undeterred, he says that he likes her and agrees to the marriage. Divya initially refuses, but when her father has a heart attack as a result of her stubborn behaviour, her mother begs her to accept the proposal to aid his recovery. Succumbing to the pressure, Divya marries Chandrakumar, but, seeing how she is unwilling, they do not consummate their marriage.\nAfter the marriage, Chandrakumar takes Divya to his house in Delhi, but she indirectly mentions that she cannot accept him as her husband. To make her comfortable, he asks her what she would like as a wedding gift, to which she replies saying she wants a divorce, which shocks Chandrakumar. Sometime later Chandrakumar gives Divya his wedding gift, but she refuses it and tells him not to try anything to make her comfortable as she cannot accept Chandrakumar as her husband because of her past love relationship with Manohar, whom she met during her college days. She reveals that she first encountered Manohar when he and his gang were robbing a politician's son. Divya reports Manohar to the police, and he is arrested. She later learns that the politician's son had run over a girl with his car, and Manohar stole the money to pay for the girl's medical treatment. Feeling guilty, Divya bails him out by pawning her gold chain.\nWhen Manohar meets Divya to return her chain, their conversation leads him to fall in love with Divya, and he tries various ways to win her love; although she initially rejects him, she eventually returns his feelings. Manohar is a member of a revolutionary group that plans to hold an illegal rally. Divya does not approve, and asks him not to attend; he agrees only if she will marry him. On their wedding day, Manohar is falsely accused of participating in the rally and arrested. He escapes and runs to the marriage registrar's office where Divya is waiting for him. A policeman accidentally shoots Manohar, and he dies in front of Divya.\nAfter hearing her story, Chandrakumar tells Divya that he does not care about her past, but about the future that he wants to build with her. He tells Divya to either sign the divorce papers he has obtained as per her request for a wedding gift or accept the anklets he bought as his wedding gift to her; Divya chooses divorce. They consult a lawyer who tells them that according to the law, they must wait one year to file for divorce since they are newly married; the couple is forced to live together for a year.\nHaving told Chandrakumar about her past and the reason why she was unable to accept her marriage, Divya finds herself finally free from her mental baggage and discomfort around Chandrakumar. She begins to appreciate her situation and make the most of it. Conversely, Chandrakumar is wary of her presence in his life as he fears what would happen at the end of the year when their divorce would be approved. Troubled, he distances himself from her and rejects her every move. At the same time, he slowly begins falling in love with her while denying his feelings to himself.\nOne day, Chandrakumar is attacked by his company's labourers because he had suspended their union leader. Divya rushes him to a nearby hospital, where he survives after receiving treatment. After he is discharged, Divya takes care of him and realises that she has fallen in love with him. She tries to show it by wearing the anklets which Chandrakumar bought as a wedding gift for her. But before he can notice the anklets, they enter an argument while Divya tried to surprise him, and Chandrakumar asks her to return to Madras and books her trip. Divya rushes out of her home alone at night after the argument and is chased by goons, but rescued by Chandrakumar. He notices her anklets and realises that she too loves him. However, the booked ticket arrives the next morning; neither Chandrakumar nor Divya express their wish for the trip to be cancelled aloud.\nOnce Chandrakumar leaves for work, Divya arrives alone at the railway station, where she sees Chandrakumar waiting for her. He hands her the finalised divorce papers, saying that it has been approved that morning. Divya breaks down, telling Chandrakumar that she loves him and would wait indefinitely for him to reciprocate. She tears the divorce papers and leaves to catch her train. Chandrakumar, surprised at Divya's open declaration, catches the train that was departing from the station, stops it and carries Divya home."

        "content": "Mouna Ragam provides insight into the issues faced by married couples, exploring the plight and perception of divorce, how societies need to view the desires of women, and questions the agency of women. Film critic Baradwaj Rangan compared it to Nenjathai Killathe (1980), another story of a woman torn between the man she loves and the man she marries, Andha 7 Naatkal (1981) and its Hindi remake, Woh Saat Din (1983). Rakesh Mehar of The News Minute noted that one thing differentiating Mouna Ragam from Andha 7 Naatkal and similar films is that it remains focused on Divya. Kumuthan Maderya, writing for PopMatters, described Mouna Ragam as a \"chick flick\", because like other chick flicks, the film allowed romance to blossom between Divya and Chandrakumar, rather than let divorce separate them; according to him, \"chick flicks center on the romantic worldview of females while gratifying their hopes and dreams usually through a warm and fuzzy denouement\".Manohar was part of a group involved in anti-government activities. Rangan drew similarities between his motives and those of characters in the Italian film The Night of the Shooting Stars (1982) and Unaroo. The connection to The Night of the Shooting Stars is referenced when a poster of it appears in a scene where Manohar and his anarchist friends plan an event. According to Rangan, the scene where Divya is looking after Chandrakumar at the hospital reflects her traditional qualities; with her strengths, she is humane and vulnerable. Divya's mischievous nature is shown in a scene where she teaches a Sardar offensive Tamil phrases, which he says to Chandrakumar's boss.Revathi compared herself to Divya, saying that Divya believes in \"living life to the fullest\" and she was once like that. Sujatha Narayanan, writing for The New Indian Express, described Chandrakumar as a \"patient-understanding-and-poised-at-all-times\" man, contrasting him with Manohar who she described as a \"dashing, brave and epitome-of-the-word-'dude'\". She noted that Divya, like the female leads in most of Ratnam's films, is \"practical with strong convictions\" and the characters \"go through their confusions unapologetically\". According to Ratnam, the line \"Neenga thottaale kambilipoochi oorraa madhri irukku\" (When you touch me, it feels as if caterpillars are crawling on me), spoken by Divya to Chandrakumar, expressed how she would feel on her wedding night.Many critics have mentioned that Mouna Ragam's background score suits its scenes and themes. According to Martin Clayton, Trevor Herbert and Richard Middleton's 2003 book, The Cultural Study of Music: A Critical Introduction, \"Oho Megam Vandhadho\" resembled Broadway and MTV styles of singing and dancing, and the main songs combine American music with Indian vocals by S. Janaki. Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu considered that Ratnam used rain in the film to accentuate the \"childlike, free-spirited nature\" of Divya. The sarangi and nadaswaram are used in the music accompanying Chandrakumar and Divya's wedding. In scenes of the couple sightseeing in Delhi, light synth-based music depicts them as modern tourists in their own country. The restaurant scene with Manohar and Divya includes awkwardly played sitar music, indicating the couple's emotions. Spanish music is used for the fight scene when Manohar attacks the politician's son.The Hindu's Sruthi Radhakrishnan described \"Panivizhum Iravu\" as \"one of those only-80s songs that served as a stand-in for sexual tension, where you'd have two people looking intensely at each other.\" Raveena Joseph of The Hindu noted that films in the 1980s which featured men stalking women, hoping to get them, were reflective of \"the times where romances were covert and such discretion was necessary even in consensual encounters\", citing Manohar stalking Divya in Mouna Ragam as an example. The film was Ratnam's first to follow the theme of a person moving to a strange place where they do not know the local language. Divya has a dilemma; since she does not know the language of Delhi, she can barely socialise with local people, and is in conflict with Chandrakumar, the only person with whom she can socialise. Rangan believed Manohar to be the first character in a Tamil film to invite a girl for a \"cup of coffee\", a form of dating. He contrasted it with Oru Thalai Ragam (1980), in which the protagonists barely spoke. Ratnam replied that although it was not uncommon to invite a girl for a cup of coffee in the 1980s, it was not reflected in mainstream Tamil cinema of the time."

In a 31 August 1986 review, the review board of the Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan praised Revathi and Mohan's performances, the film's camera work, music and lack of masala, giving Mouna Ragam a score of 43 out of 100. Jayamanmadhan (a duo) of Kalki wrote that Karthik's presence completely overshadowed Mohan and Revathi while appreciating Sriram's cinematography. The duo said it almost felt like Sreeram had a magic wand instead of camera and also called the screenplay consistent which moves seamlessly but found the story slightly lagging after the intermission and the song set in Agra as minus points. Jayamanmadhan concluded that the relief that one gets after getting up from watching the film would get rid of all the irritants in the film and felt that was enough. Kaviya Shetty of India Today wrote in 1994, \"[Mouna Ragam] found the perfect formula of a strong storyline and great music, presented in a fresh visual style that caught the audience by surprise\"."

The film introduced techniques such as soft-focus shots, flare filters and backlighting, which became popular in Tamil cinema. Ratnam continued using these techniques in his later films, notably Nayakan (1987) and Agni Natchathiram (1988). Mouna Ragam's theme of a person moving to a new place where they do not know the local language was replicated in Ratnam's later films like Nayakan, Roja (1992) and Bombay (1995). It was also Ratnam's first film to make extensive use of staccato dialogue; this became another recurring feature in his later films. The film became a major breakthrough for Karthik despite his role being a cameo, and his \"Mr. Chandramouli\" dialogue became popular. A feature film, released in 2018 and starring him, was named after this dialogue. The character of Chandramouli became one of Sankaran's best known roles.According to a Rediff.com article, \"The Most Memorable Mani Movies\", Mouna Ragam was \"arguably the film that announced Mani Ratnam to the Tamil film industry as a talent to watch out for.

Pavithra Srinivasan of the same website said, \"It took a Mani Ratnam to move away from clich\u00e9d romantic dialogues and capture subtle nuances that add so much richness to the story, introduce proper, three dimensional characters that lived breathed and sorrowed like everyone else\". Deccan Chronicle listed Karthik and Revathi on its \"Top 10 Jodis\" of Tamil cinema; they \"made a fresh pair and were adored by the youth, especially the college students. Their awesome on-screen chemistry in Mouna Ragam was a talking point back then\". For the April 2013 centenary of Indian cinema, Forbes India included Revathi's performance in its list, \"25 Greatest Acting Performances of Indian Cinema\"."

        "content": "Mouna Ragam has influenced countless films, particularly regarding the trope of the bride or groom being reluctantly married. These include Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (1999), Vallamai Tharayo (2008), Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), Tanu Weds Manu (2011), Raja Rani (2013) where both the male and female leads have past lovers, Bangalore Days (2014) where a man who is unable to forget his past love and accept his wife, and Maalai Naerathu Mayakkam (2016).Karthi said that his character in Naan Mahaan Alla (2010) was similar to Karthik's \"moody yet jovial\" character in Mouna Ragam. Sri Divya called Revathi's character an influence on her role in Mallela Theeram Lo Sirimalle Puvvu (2013). Vaibhav Reddy compared his character in Kappal (2014) to Manohar in Mouna Ragam because of their shared effervescence. Director B. V. Nandini Reddy said that the story of a bride unhappy with her husband in Mouna Ragam inspired her to make Kalyana Vaibhogame (2016), where neither the bride nor the bridegroom is interested in marriage.The scene where Manohar tries to declare his love for Divya through the college intercom in response to her challenge was parodied in Thamizh Padam (2010).  Director R. S. Prasanna described one scene in Kalyana Samayal Saadham (2013) where the male lead meets his father-in-law at a caf\u00e9 as an ode to the \"Mr. Chandramouli\" scene. In Master (2021), JD (Vijay) lies about his past but from Manohar's perspective."

        "content": "The Hateful Eight is a 2015 American Western film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. It stars Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Demi\u00e1n Bichir, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Bruce Dern, as eight dubious strangers who seek refuge from a blizzard in a stagecoach stopover some time after the American Civil War.\nTarantino announced the film in November 2013. He conceived it as a novel and sequel to his 2012 film Django Unchained before deciding to make it a standalone film. After the script leaked in January 2014, he decided to abandon the production and publish it as a novel instead. In April 2014, Tarantino directed a live reading of the script at the United Artists Theater in Los Angeles, before reconsidering a new draft and resuming the project. Filming began in January 2015 near Telluride, Colorado. Italian composer Ennio Morricone composed the original score, his first complete Western score in 34 years (and the last before his death in 2020), his first for a high-profile Hollywood production since 2000, and the first and only original score for a Tarantino film.\nDistributed by The Weinstein Company in the United States, The Hateful Eight was released on December 25, 2015, in a limited roadshow release on 70 mm film, before expanding wide theatrically five days later. The film was praised for its direction, screenplay, score, cinematography, and performances, though the depiction of race relations and the violent treatment of Leigh's character divided opinions. It has grossed over $156 million worldwide. For his work on the score, Morricone won his only Academy Award for Best Original Score after five previous nominations. The film also earned Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Leigh) and Best Cinematography (Robert Richardson).\nIn 2019, a re-edited version of the film was released as a four-episode miniseries on Netflix with the subtitle Extended Version. The Hateful Eight is Tarantino's final collaboration with The Weinstein Company following allegations of sexual abuse against Harvey Weinstein in 2017."

        "content": "In 1870, bounty hunter and Union Army veteran Major Marquis Warren heads to Red Rock, Wyoming, with three bounty corpses. His horse gives out, and, faced with a blizzard, Warren hitches a ride on a stagecoach driven by O.B. Jackson. Aboard is bounty hunter John Ruth \"The Hangman\", handcuffed to fugitive \"Crazy\" Daisy Domergue, whom he is taking to Red Rock to be hanged. Warren and Ruth had previously bonded over Warren's personal letter from Abraham Lincoln. Chris Mannix, whose father, Erskine, led a Lost-Causer militia called Mannix's Marauders, claims to be Red Rock's new sheriff and joins them. During the trip, Ruth learns about the Confederate bounty on Warren's head for breaking out of and setting fire to a prisoner-of-war camp.\nThey seek refuge from the blizzard at Minnie's Haberdashery, tended by Bob, a Mexican who claims to be watching the haberdashery in Minnie's and her husband Sweet Dave's absence. The lodge shelters local hangman Oswaldo Mobray, cowboy Joe Gage, and Confederate general Sanford Smithers, who is planning to erect a cenotaph for his missing son, Chester Charles. Suspicious, Ruth disarms all but Warren. While Mannix recognizes Smithers as a war hero, Warren wants him dead as revenge for ordering the execution of black prisoners of war at Baton Rouge. At dinner, Mannix surmises that the Lincoln letter is false. Warren responds to Ruth's disappointment by saying his forged letter buys him leeway with whites.\nAfter a small talk, Warren puts one of his guns next to Smithers and claims that he raped and murdered Smithers' son, who had tried to claim the bounty. When Smithers reaches for the gun, Warren kills him.\nDuring the confrontation, the coffee is poisoned, which Daisy silently witnessed. Ruth and O.B. drink the coffee; O.B. dies, and Daisy kills the dying Ruth with his own gun. Warren disarms Daisy, leaving her shackled to Ruth's corpse, and holds the others at gunpoint except Mannix, who nearly drank the poisoned coffee himself. Warren deduces, with evidence, that Bob is lying about looking after the haberdashery and kills him. When Warren threatens to kill Daisy, Gage admits that he poisoned the coffee. An unknown man hiding under the floorboards shoots Warren in the groin, and Mobray and Mannix shoot and wound one another.\nA flashback shows Bob, Mobray, Gage, and Daisy's brother Jody arriving at the lodge hours earlier. They killed Minnie, Sweet Dave, and all the employees and customers except Smithers, whom they spared to create a believable setting in exchange for his silence. Once they finished hiding the bodies, cleaning the store, and hiding weapons for future use, Jody hid in the cellar as Ruth, Daisy, O.B., Warren and Mannix arrived.\nIn the present, Warren and Mannix, both seriously wounded, hold Daisy, Gage, and Mobray at gunpoint. When they threaten to kill Daisy, Jody surrenders and is executed by Warren. The surviving gang members claim fifteen hired guns are waiting in Red Rock and offer a deal: if Mannix kills Warren, they will spare him and allow him to collect the bounty on the dying Mobray and the deceased Bob (whose real names are revealed as \"English\" Pete Hicox and Marco \"the Mexican\", respectively). Warren kills Hicox when he tries to persuade Mannix. Warren and Mannix then kill Gage (whose real name is \"Grouch\" Douglass) when he grabs a pistol hidden under a table.\nMannix hears Daisy's proposal but deduces she is lying. When Mannix faints from blood loss, Daisy hacks off Ruth's arm and goes for a gun, but Mannix reawakens and wounds her. Mannix and Warren hang Daisy from the rafters in honor of Ruth, who always brought his bounty to the gallows (which earned him the nickname \"The Hangman\"). As they lie dying, Mannix reads aloud Warren's fake Lincoln letter, complimenting its detail."

He initially attempted the story as a novel, a sequel to his film Django Unchained (2012), titled Django in White Hell but realized that the Django character did not fit the story. On January 11, 2014, the title was announced as The Hateful Eight.The film was inspired by the 1960s Western TV series Bonanza, The Virginian, and The High Chaparral. Tarantino said:\n\nTwice per season, those shows would have an episode where a bunch of outlaws would take the lead characters hostage. They would come to the Ponderosa and hold everybody hostage, or go to Judge Garth's place \u2013 Lee J. Cobb played him \u2013 in The Virginian and take hostages. There would be a guest star like David Carradine, Darren McGavin, Claude Akins, Robert Culp, Charles Bronson, or James Coburn. I don't like that storyline in a modern context, but I love it in a Western, where you would pass halfway through the show to find out if they were good or bad guys, and they all had a past that was revealed. I thought, 'What if I did a movie starring nothing but those characters? No heroes, no Michael Landons. Just a bunch of nefarious guys in a room, all telling backstories that may or may not be true. Trap those guys together in a room with a blizzard outside, give them guns, and see what happens.\nProduction was planned for late 2014 in the winter, but after the script leaked online in January 2014, Tarantino considered publishing it as a novel instead. He said he had given the script to a few trusted colleagues, including Reginald Hudlin, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern, and Tim Roth. This version of the script featured a different ending in which Warren and Mannix attempt to kill Gage in revenge by forcing him to drink the poisoned coffee, sparking a firefight in which every character is killed. Tarantino described his vision for the character of Daisy Domergue as a \"Susan Atkins of the Wild West\". Madsen based Joe Gage on Peter Breck's performance in The Big Valley.On April 19, 2014, Tarantino directed a live reading of the leaked script at the United Artists Theater in the Ace Hotel Los Angeles. The event was organized by the Film Independent at Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) as part of the Live Read series and was introduced by Elvis Mitchell. Tarantino explained that they would read the first draft of the script, and he added that he was writing two new drafts with a different ending. The actors who joined Tarantino included Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Dern, Roth, Madsen, Walton Goggins, Zo\u00eb Bell, Amber Tamblyn, James Parks, James Remar, and Dana Gourrier."

        "content": "Medgar Evers was an African-American civil rights activist in Mississippi murdered on June 12, 1963. It was suspected that Byron De La Beckwith, a white supremacist, was the murderer. He had been tried twice in the 1960s and both trials ended in hung juries. Evers' widow Myrlie Evers had been trying to bring De La Beckwith to justice for over 25 years.\nIn 1989, emboldened by a newspaper article by Jerry Mitchell exposing jury tampering by the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission in the first two trials, Myrlie Evers believed she had what it would take to bring him to trial again. Although most of the evidence from the old trial had disappeared, Bobby DeLaughter, an assistant District Attorney, decided to help her despite being warned that it might hurt his political aspirations and the strain that it caused in his marriage. DeLaughter forms a team of investigators from his office, however, the investigation suffers many setbacks.\nAfter learning that several of the key witnesses have died, and the court transcript of their testimony from the 1960s trials is lost, the team is convinced this is a futile effort. This is reinforced when DeLaughter fails at a desperate strategy of convincing two police officers who provided De La Beckwith with an alibi in the 1960s trials to admit they lied under oath. However, their pessimism fades with two discoveries. The rifle used in the murder, thought to have been lost, was hiding in plain sight. Later, one of the investigators learns of the existence of a witness unknown to the prosecution in the 1960s trials, Delmar Dennis. Dennis was a former member of the Ku Klux Klan who agreed to be an undercover informant for the FBI. Dennis testified against the Klan in the Mississippi Burning case, and once mentioned having met De La Beckwith. The investigation turns to finding Dennis, who was living in hiding since turning state's evidence on the KKK, to see what he knows of the case.\nOnce confirming that Dennis indeed had met De La Beckwith, the team is optimistic they have enough to secure a new indictment. As knowledge becomes public that the district attorney's office has re-opened the case, white supremacist elements threaten DeLaughter and his children, having by this time separated from his wife. After committing to Myrlie that he will try De La Beckwith again, Myrlie, initially skeptical of DeLaughter, reveals that she has a court certified transcript of one of the 1960s trials in her possession. DeLaughter had long sought such a transcript to be able to read testimony from deceased witnesses to the jury for the new trial. DeLaughter mostly presents the same case as was presented in the 1960s trial, with the addition of Dennis and two other witnesses who supported Dennis's testimony. Detective Lloyd Bennett read the testimony of his father, Detective LC Bennett, the officer who found the murder weapon while searching the crime scene, to the jury.\nIn 1994, De La Beckwith was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. The film ends with Myrlie tearfully rejoicing to the assembled crowd at the courthouse that she never gave up in the fight for justice for Medgar."

Jacob witnesses his murdered driver, a black-marketeering American soldier named Tully, being fished from a river, suspiciously adjacent to the Potsdam conference grounds. The corpse is discovered to be in possession of 50,000 German reichsmarks \u2014 which are later revealed to have been printed by the U.S occupying forces.\nGeismer becomes entwined in both the mystery of his murdered driver and the clandestine search by both Soviet and American forces for the missing German Emil Brandt. He becomes more involved in both mysteries as his investigation intersects with his search for Lena Brandt, a Jew married to Emil. Geismer had been in a relationship with Lena during his first stint as a journalist in pre-war Berlin. She has survived the Holocaust by doing \"what she had to\" to stay alive \u2014 early in the film this is assumed to be prostitution, but Lena (based loosely on the Jewish collaborator Stella Goldschlag) is later revealed to be secretly complicit in the deportation of her fellow Jews.\nIn the film, Emil Brandt is a former SS officer who had been the secretary of Franz Bettmann, Chief Production Engineer of the V-2 rocket at concentration camp Mittelbau-Dora/Mittelwerk. (Bettmann is only a minor character in the film; he appears to be based on the real Arthur Rudolph.) The Soviets, the Americans, and the British all try to get hold of Emil Brandt, for different reasons. The Americans have already detained Bettmann in a safehouse and intend to transport him to the U.S. as part of their Operation Overcast/Paperclip to have him work on their own rocket program (cf. Wernher von Braun). In the film, they are fully aware of Bettmann's role at Camp Dora and know about the slave labor used in the V-2 program, but want to cover up his involvement (because they could not lawfully employ a known war criminal), which includes eliminating Emil Brandt, whose testimony or written notes could prevent the cover-up.\nGeismer, in his attempts to get Lena out of Berlin, gets more and more involved in the search for Emil Brandt. At one point, Lena gives Emil's notes on Camp Dora to Geismer. When Lena and Geismer try to hand Emil Brandt over to the American prosecutor charged with handling war crimes cases, they are intercepted by the American authorities who want to protect Bettmann, and Brandt is murdered. But Geismer still has Brandt's notebooks, which he now trades in to the war crimes investigators of the U.S. Army (who have turned out to be in league with the other American authorities \u2014 the ones who want to keep the evidence confidential to whitewash Bettmann) in exchange for a Persilschein (a denazification document) and a visa for Lena, such that she can leave Germany."

Most of the scenes were shot on soundstages and on Universal Studios' backlot, and were then edited with archival Russian footage and archived film from Corbis. Although the finished film is in black and white, it was shot in color because this allowed the use of faster film than available black-and-white film stocks, and afforded the ability to use 'green screen' techniques. The color was then reduced in post-production through the use of a digital intermediate to a grainier black and white, in order to blend with the carefully restored archival material.Unlike modern films that are shot with significant \"coverage\" and mostly with close-ups or two shots, The Good German was shot with 1940s era wide angle lenses, such as a 32 mm, with deep focus, \"strongly accented camera angles\" and entire scenes staged. Director Steven Soderbergh said:\n\nthat kind of staging is a lost art, which is too bad. The reason they no longer work that way is because it means making choices, real choices, and sticking to them ... That's not what people do now. They want all the options they can get in the editing room.\nThe set lighting was entirely incandescent and the audio was recorded on a boom mike instead of the more modern body mikes or automated dialogue replacement  (ADR).

Advocate Bail Lingam bails them out whenever legal issues arise because of their brawls. Katamarayudu hates the idea of marriage as he feels that his wife might create disharmony among brothers. Though the four younger brothers say that they do not want to either fall in love or get married, when Katama is not around, they all have their secret lovers. To get the  approval of their love stories, they learn through his brother's childhood friend Collector that Katama, when in school, was in love with a girl named Avantika, and his brothers hatch a plan to find her and reintroduce her to  Katama so that he may fall for her all over again. However, she is married now and has kids, so the brothers hatch  to find another woman named Avantika because Katama was not in love with that girl so much as her name, and when he meets another (completely random) girl with that name, he is sure to lose his heart to her just because she bears that name. Though initially reluctant, later  Katama  falls in love with her. He clashes with a businessman called Radia to take care of the market in the village.

Yelasari Bhanu, who escapes from the death sentence, arrives to kill Bhupathi, but  Katama keeps him and his family in a safe place. Yelasari Bhanu informs  Katamarayudu that he had kidnapped one of his brothers, Sivarayudu.  Katama arrives at the nick of time and saves his brother but instead gets attacked by Yelasari Bhanu.

She sentences the crew to be turned into trash cans, and Captain EO to 100 years of torture in her deepest dungeon. Before being sent away, Captain EO tells the Supreme Leader that he sees the beauty hidden within her, and that he brings her the key to unlock it: his song, \"We Are Here to Change the World\".\nThe two robot members of the crew transform into musical instruments, and the crew members begin to play the various instruments. As Hooter runs toward his instrument, he trips over EO's cape and breaks it, stopping the music. The spell broken, the Supreme Leader orders her guards to capture Captain EO and his crew.\nHooter manages to repair his instrument and sends out a blast of music, providing EO with the power to throw off the guards. He uses his power to transform the dark hulking guards into agile dancers who fall into step behind him for a dance number, which leads into the song, \"We Are Here to Change the World\". The Supreme Leader unleashes her Whip Warriors, two cybernetic defenders each with a whip and shield that can deflect EO's power.\nThe others all run away, leaving Captain EO to fight the Whip Warriors alone. EO is trapped by a closing gate and prepares for a last stand as both the whip warriors draw their whips back for a final blow. Fuzzball drops his instrument and speedily flies over to tie the two whips together, causing the Whip Warriors to be thrown off balance and giving EO an opportunity to transform them as well. With no further obstacles, EO uses his power to transform the remaining four henchmen (not yet unleashed) and they, the transformed whip warriors and the other dancers, press forward in dance. Captain EO then flies up to the Supreme Leader and transforms her into a beautiful woman, her lair into a peaceful Greek temple, and the planet into a paradise.\nA celebration breaks out to \"Another Part of Me\", as Captain EO and his crew triumphantly exit and fly off into space, ending the film."

He suffers from cluster headaches, extreme paranoia, hallucinations, and schizoid personality disorder. His only social interactions are with his mathematics mentor, Sol Robeson (now disabled from a stroke), and those who live in his building: Jenna, a little girl fascinated by his ability to perform complex calculations, and Devi, a young woman living next door who sometimes speaks with him.  \nMax tries to program his computer, Euclid, to make stock predictions. Euclid malfunctions, printing out a seemingly random 216-digit number, as well as a single stock pick at one-tenth its current value, then crashes. Disgusted, Max throws away the printout. The next morning, he learns that Euclid's pick was accurate but cannot find the printout. When Max mentions the number, Sol becomes unnerved and asks if it contained 216 digits, revealing that he came across the same number years ago. He urges Max to take a break from his work.\nMax meets Lenny Meyer, a Hasidic Jew who does mathematical research on the Torah. Lenny demonstrates some simple Gematria, the correspondence of the Hebrew alphabet to numbers, and explains that some people believe the Torah is a string of numbers forming a code sent by God. Intrigued, Max notes some of the concepts parallel other mathematical concepts, such as the Fibonacci sequence. Agents of a Wall Street firm approach Max. One of them, Marcy Dawson, offers him a classified computer chip called \"Ming Mecca\" in exchange for the results of his work.\nUsing the chip, Max has Euclid analyze mathematical patterns in the Torah. Once again, Euclid displays the 216-digit number before crashing. As Max writes down the number, he realizes that he knows the pattern, undergoes an epiphany, and loses consciousness. After waking up, Max appears to become clairvoyant and visualizes the stock market patterns he sought. His headaches intensify, and he discovers a vein-like bulge protruding from his right temple. Max has a falling out with Sol after Sol urges him to quit his work.\nDawson and her agents grab Max on the street and try to force him to explain the number, having found the printout Max threw away. Attempting to use the number to manipulate the stock market, the firm instead caused the market to crash. Driving by, Lenny rescues Max, but takes him to his companions at a nearby synagogue. They ask Max to give them the 216-digit number, believing it was meant for them to bring about the messianic age, as the number represents the unspeakable name of God. Max refuses, insisting the number has been revealed to him alone.\nMax flees and visits Sol, only to learn from his daughter, Jenny, that he died from another stroke. He finds a piece of paper with the number in his study. At his own apartment, Max experiences another headache but does not take his painkillers. Driven mad, he destroys part of Euclid. Believing the number and the headaches are linked, Max tries to concentrate on the number through his pain. After passing out, Max has a vision of himself standing in a white void and repeating the digits of the number. The vision ends with Max hugging Devi, who is revealed to be a hallucination. Standing alone in his trashed apartment, Max burns the paper with the number and begins to use a drill on his head in a trepanning procedure.\nSometime later, Jenna approaches Max in a park and asks him to do several calculations, including 748 \u00f7 238 (an approximation for pi). Max smiles and says that he does not know the answer. He sits on the bench and watches the trees blowing in the breeze, seemingly at peace."

        "content": "Before production, to finance the complex visual sets and shots for the film, producer Eric Watson and director Darren Aronofsky begged every friend, relative or acquaintance for donations of $100 each. Eventually, they accumulated an estimated $60,000 for their production budget.The film was shot on an Aaton XTR Prod Camera, which shoots with 16mm film, with a Bolex H16 Camera used for most of the handheld shots that the crew broke and had to fix.  A Canon 16mm camera package was also used. Lenses were from Angenieux. The film was shot on black and white reversal film stock; Aronofsky aimed for high-contrast shots to give Pi a more \"technically raw and spontaneous\" look.Pi was produced with a low budget (production cost is reported to be $60,927), with the crew being paid $200 a day and actors being paid $75 a day.  To save money, various cost-cutting techniques were used, including using only the actors' clothes and thrift store purchases as costumes, and shooting all of the subway and outdoor city scenes illegally to get around paying expensive permits. To get vehicles for the film, Aronofsky says he \"probably\" rented a station wagon belonging to the film's consulting producer, and claims to have hailed a cab and paid the driver $100 to keep his car there for a scene that was later cut, rather than renting out an additional vehicle.For the main set, which was Max Cohen's apartment, Scott Franklin's father allowed the production to use a warehouse he owned in Bushwick, Brooklyn. While the crew was able to shoot in the warehouse for free, they did have to pay the electricity bill, which increased dramatically during filming.  A back room was cleared out and used as a sound stage, where Max's Euclid supercomputer was built and the majority of the film was shot.\nFinishing the film was more costly than shooting it. The post-budget was $68,183, most of which went into post-production sound, film and lab work, and film editing. Throughout the filming, fifty-three thousand feet of 16mm film was shot, amounting to about 23 hours over 28 days.The film was sent to be developed in Bono Labs in Arlington, Virginia, which was the only one to develop black and white reversal stock. Consequently, the crew only received dailies after a week of sending the footage in. Raw stock cost $5,414 and developing it cost $18,000. During post-production, most of the budget went toward the negative cut, which was a match back from an AVID cut list. Clint Mansell created the score on his equipment, for which he was paid a deferred fee.\nThe production cost was $60,927, with post-production costing an additional $68,183. Along with other expenses, including insurance, the film cost $134,815."

Tragedy strikes when an old woman named Vidyavati also unveils a body only to find her son under the cloth and is terrified to see her son in that condition.\nA great strike was held on 24 March mourning the death of those three youngsters. Meanwhile, at Malir station in Karachi, Mahatma Gandhi arrives at the station and sees his supporters praising him, except for those youngsters shouting insults against him for not saving the three youngsters, it was revealed that they were Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru respectively. They gift him a crafted black rose and explain to him the reason, Gandhiji tells them that he appreciates their feelings for the country and he could have given his life to save them, but they were on the wrong path of patriotism and didn't want to live. A youngster disagrees with his reply and says that his intention was similar to that of the British government who never wanted to free the three young revolutionaries, and added that Gandhiji never tried his best to free them. Gandhiji also says that he never supports the path of violence. The youngsters still disagreed and concluded that history will ask this question to him forever, continuing the insults for Gandhiji and praising Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru. Bhagat Singh's father, Kishan Singh secretly greets him. The story later rewinds to past events.\nBhagat Singh was born on 28 September 1907, at Banga village of Lyallpur district in Punjab Province of British India. He witnesses some British officials torturing people who were not even guilty, the young Bhagat also hears that the British officials cussed them \"Bloody Indians\" when he was on his father's lap who was going back after witnessing all the atrocities. At the age of 12, Bhagat takes a solemn vow to free India from the British Raj after witnessing the aftermath of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. Soon after the massacre, he learns of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's satyagraha policies and begins to support the non-cooperation movement, in which thousands of people burn British-made clothing and abandon school, college studies, and government jobs. In February 1922, Gandhi calls off the movement after the Chauri Chaura incident. Feeling betrayed by Gandhi, Bhagat decides to become a revolutionary, and, as an adult, he goes to Cawnpore and joins the Hindustan Republican Association, a revolutionary organization, in its struggle for India's independence, ending up in prison for his activities. Singh's father, Kishen Singh, bails him out on a fee of \u20b960,000 so that he can get him to run a dairy farm and marry a girl named Mannewali. Bhagat runs away from home, leaving a note saying that his love for the country comes first.\nWhen Lala Lajpat Rai is beaten (lathi charged) to death by the police while protesting against the Simon Commission, Bhagat, along with Shivram Hari Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar and Chandra Shekhar Azad, killed John P. Saunders (who is mistaken for James A. Scott who ordered Lala Lajpat Rai's beatdown), a British police officer, on 17 December 1928. Two days later the incident, they were in disguise to escape from the police who started an identification process with the witnesses of the murder to arrest them. Later, in Calcutta, they start to think that their efforts have gone waste and decide to make a plan for an explosion. After meeting Jatindra Nath Das who reluctantly agrees, they learn the bomb-making process and check whether it is successful. Azad starts to worry whether anything may happen to Bhagat, Bhagat is later consoled by Sukhdev and Azad reluctantly agrees. On 8 April 1929, when the British proposed the Trade Disputes and Public Safety Bills, Bhagat, along with Batukeshwar Dutt, initiate a bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly. He and Dutt throw the bombs on empty benches due to their intention to avoid causing casualties. They are subsequently arrested and tried publicly. Bhagat then gives a speech about his ideas of revolution, stating that he wanted to tell the world about the freedom fighters himself rather than let the British misrepresent them as violent people, citing this as the reason for bombing the assembly. Bhagat soon becomes more popular than Gandhi among the Indian populace, in particular the younger generation, laborers, and farmers.\nIn Lahore Central Jail, Bhagat and all of the other fellow prisoners, including Sukhdev and Rajguru, undertake a 116-day hunger strike to improve the conditions of Indian political prisoners. On the 63rd day, one of Bhagat's partners Jatin Das, dies of cholera in police custody as he could not bear the disease anymore. Meanwhile, Azad, whom the British had repeatedly failed to capture, is ambushed at the Alfred Park in Allahabad on 27 February 1931. The police surround the entire park leading to a shootout; refusing to be captured by the British, Azad commits suicide with the last remaining bullet in his Colt pistol.\nFearing the growing popularity of the hunger strike amongst the Indian public nationwide, Lord Irwin (the Viceroy of British India) order the re-opening of the Saunders' murder case, which leads to capital death sentences being imposed on Bhagat, Sukhdev, and Rajguru. The Indians hope that Gandhi will use his pact with Irwin as an opportunity to save Bhagat, Sukhdev, and Rajguru's lives. Irwin refuses Gandhi's request for their release. Gandhi reluctantly agrees to sign a pact that includes the clause: \"Release of political prisoners except for the ones involved in violence\". Bhagat, Sukhdev, and Rajguru are hanged in secrecy on 23rd March 1931 even before their trial on 24 March 1931."

        "content": "A. R. Rahman composed the soundtrack and score for The Legend of Bhagat Singh, marking his second collaboration with Santoshi after Pukar. Sameer wrote the lyrics for the songs. In an interview with Arthur J. Pais of Rediff.com, Rahman said that Santoshi wanted him to compose songs that would stand apart from his other projects like Lagaan (2001) and Zubeidaa (2001). Rahman took care to compose the tunes for \"Mera Rang De Basanti\" in a slow-paced manner to avoid comparisons with the songs in Shaheed, which he and Santoshi found to be fast-paced. Rahman followed the same procedure for \"Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna\". He created a softer tune, saying that the \"song is pictured on men who have fasted for over a month. How can I compose a high-sounding tune for that song?\" Despite this, Rahman admitted that \"Des Mere Des\" had \"some strains\" from Lagaan's music. Rahman took \"Santoshi's commitment to the film\" as a source of inspiration to make an album that was \"flavorsome [sic] and different.\" Rahman experimented with Punjabi music more than he had done before on his previous soundtracks, receiving assistance from Sukhwinder Singh and Sonu Nigam. The soundtrack was completed within two months, with \"Des Mere Des\" recorded in an hour.The soundtrack, marketed by Tips, was released on 8 May 2002 in New Delhi. The songs, especially \"Mera Rang De Basanti\" and \"Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna\", received favourable reviews. A review carried by The Hindu said that while \"Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna\" had a \"forceful\" impact, \"Mera Rang De Basanti\" and \"Pagdi Sambhal Jatta\" were \"not the boom-boom types but subtly tuned\". The review praised Rahman's ability \"to impart the sombre and poignant mood\" in all the album's songs \"so well that despite being subdued, it retains the patriotic fervour\". Seema Pant of Rediff.com said that \"Mera Rang De Basanti\" and \"Mahive Mahive\" were \"well rendered\" by their respective singers and called \"Sura So Pahchaniye\" an \"intense track, both lyrically as well as composition wise\". Pant praised Sukhwinder Singh's \"exquisite rendition\" of \"Pagdi Sambhal Jatta\" and described the duet version of \"Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna\" as having \"been beautifully composed\". She appreciated how the \"tabla, santoor and flute gives this slow and soft number a classical touch.\" A critic from Sify said the music is \"good\". While Pant and the Sify reviewer concurred with Rahman that \"Des Mere Des\" was similar to Lagaan's music, the review in The Hindu compared the song to \"Bharat Hum Ko Jaan Se Pyaara Hain\" (\"Thamizha Thamizha\") from Roja (1992)."

Kumar Taurani defended his film saying that he did not add Rao \"for ornamental value\", noting he would have opted for an established actress instead if that were the case. A press statement issued by Tips Industries said: \"This girl from Manawali village loved Bhagat Singh so totally that she remained unmarried till death and was known as Bhagat Singh's widow.\" The chief operating officer of Tips Industries, Raju Hingorani, pointed out that Kultar had authenticated the film, stating: \"With his backing, why must we be afraid of other allegations?\"On 29 May 2002, a 14-page petition was filed by Paramjit Kaur, the daughter of Bhagat's youngest brother, Rajinder Singh, at the Punjab and Haryana High Court to stay the release of both The Legend of Bhagat Singh and 23rd March 1931: Shaheed, alleging that they \"contained distorted versions\" of the freedom fighter's life. Kaur's lawyer, Sandeep Bhansal, argued that Bhagat singing a duet with Mannewali and wearing garlands were \"untrue and amounted to distortion of historical facts\". Two days later, the petition came up for hearing before the Judges Justice J. L. Gupta and Justice Narinder Kumar Sud; both refused to stay the films' release, observing that the petition was moved \"too late and it would not be proper to stop the screening of the films\"."

The Wild Bunch was filmed in Technicolor and Panavision, in Mexico, notably at the Hacienda Ci\u00e9naga del Carmen, deep in the desert between Torre\u00f3n and Saltillo, Coahuila, and on the Nazas River.\nThe Wild Bunch is noted for intricate, multi-angle, quick-cut editing using normal and slow motion images, a revolutionary cinema technique in 1969. The writing of Green, Peckinpah, and Sickner was nominated for a best screenplay Oscar, and the music by Jerry Fielding was nominated for Best Original Score. Additionally, Peckinpah was nominated for an Outstanding Directorial Achievement award by the Directors Guild of America, and cinematographer Lucien Ballard won the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Cinematography.\nIn 1999, the Library of Congress selected The Wild Bunch for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\". The film was ranked 80th in the American Film Institute's 100 best American films and the 69th most thrilling film. In 2008, the AFI listed 10 best films in 10 genres and ranked The Wild Bunch as the sixth-best Western."

        "content": "In 1913 Texas, Pike Bishop, the leader of a gang of aging outlaws, seeks to retire after a final robbery of silver from a railroad payroll office. Corrupt railroad agent Pat Harrigan has hired a posse of bounty hunters led by Pike's former partner Deke Thornton, who ambush and kill more than half of Bishop's gang in a bloody shootout, which also kills many innocent bystanders as Pike uses a serendipitous temperance union parade to shield their getaway.\nPike rides off with the only survivors: his close friend Dutch Engstrom, brothers Lyle and Tector Gorch, the inexperienced Angel, and a fifth man blinded and mortally wounded by buckshot, who Pike mercy-kills. The loot from the robbery turns out to be worthless steel washers planted by Harrigan. Needing money, they head for Mexico accompanied by the cantankerous Freddie Sykes and cross the Rio Grande to the rural village where Angel was born. The village elder warns them about General Mapache, a vicious Huertista officer in the Mexican Federal Army, who has been stealing food and animals from local villages to support his campaign against the forces of Pancho Villa.\nPike's gang ask the general for work at his headquarters in the town of Agua Verde. Angel spots his former lover Teresa in Mapache's arms and shoots her dead, angering the general and nearly getting them killed, but Pike defuses the situation. Mapache offers gold to the gang to rob a U.S. Army train so Mapache can resupply his army's dwindling stocks of ammunition and provide samples of American weapons to his German military adviser Commander Mohr.\nAngel gives his share of the gold to Pike in return for sending one crate of rifles and ammunition to a band of peasant rebels opposed to Mapache. The holdup goes largely as planned until Thornton's posse turns up on the train the gang has robbed and chases them to the Mexican border. The robbers blow up a trestle bridge spanning the Rio Grande as the posse tries to cross, dumping the entire posse into the river, but the exhausted posse continues their pursuit.\n\nPike, anticipating that Mapache might double-cross him, hides the goods and has his men sell them to Mapache in separate amounts. However, Mapache learns from Teresa's mother that Angel stole some of the weapons and reveals this as Angel and Dutch deliver the last of the weapons. Angel desperately tries to escape, only to be captured and beaten. Mapache lets Dutch go after he states that Angel is a thief who deserves to be punished, and Dutch then tells Pike and the others what happened.\nSykes is wounded by Thornton's posse while securing spare horses. Dutch criticizes Thornton for working with the railroad, but Pike says Thornton \"gave his word\" to the railroad and must see it through. Dutch angrily declares, \"That ain't what counts, it's who you give it to.\" Pike and the gang bury most of the gold and return to Agua Verde, where the townspeople and soldiers are drunkenly celebrating the weapons sale and Mapache is dragging Angel through town on a rope tied to the back of his car. Mapache refuses to sell Angel back to the gang, and after a period of reflection while visiting a brothel, Pike and the others arm themselves to rescue their friend by force.\nMapache initially agrees to release Angel, only to cut his throat at the last second. The gang instantly opens fire and guns down the general. While the nearby soldiers are frozen in shock, Pike calmly takes aim and kills Mohr. This begins a bloody gunfight that kills Pike, Dutch, the remaining gang members, Mohr's aide, every member of Mapache's staff, and most of the assembled troops.\nThornton arrives and finds Pike already dead. Thornton finds a loaded revolver on Pike's belt and takes it as a sign that the days of men like him are over. Feeling outdated and tired, Thornton allows the remaining posse members to greedily strip Pike and his men of their possessions before taking them back to Texas for the bounty, while he stays behind. After some time, Sykes arrives with the elder from Angel's village and a band of rebels, indicating that they caught up with the bounty hunters, avenged the gang's deaths, and buried them properly. Sykes invites Thornton to join the coming revolution against the Mexican government. Thornton smiles and rides off with them."

        "content": "Critics of The Wild Bunch note the theme of the end of the outlaw gunfighter era. For example, the character Pike Bishop advises: \"We've got to start thinking beyond our guns. Those days are closing fast.\" The Bunch lives by an anachronistic code of honor that is out of place in 20th-century society. Also, when the gang inspects Mapache's new automobile, they perceive it marks the end of horse travel, a symbol also in Peckinpah's Ride the High Country (1962) and The Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970).The violence that was much criticized in 1969 remains controversial. Peckinpah noted it was allegoric of the American war in Vietnam, the violence of which was nightly televised to American homes at supper time. He tried showing the gun violence commonplace to the historic western frontier period, rebelling against sanitized, bloodless television Westerns and films glamorizing gunfights and murder: \"The point of the film is to take this fa\u00e7ade of movie violence and open it up, get people involved in it so that they are starting to go in the Hollywood television predictable reaction syndrome, and then twist it so that it's not fun anymore, just a wave of sickness in the gut ... it's ugly, brutalizing, and bloody awful; it's not fun and games and cowboys and Indians. It's a terrible, ugly thing, and yet there's a certain response that you get from it, an excitement, because we're all violent people.\" Peckinpah used violence as a catharsis, believing his audience would be purged of violence by witnessing it explicitly on screen. He later admitted to being mistaken, observing that the audience came to enjoy rather than be horrified by his films' violence, which troubled him.Betrayal is the secondary theme of The Wild Bunch. The characters suffer from their knowledge of having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate, thus violating their own honor code when it suits them (\"$10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties\"). However, Bishop says, \"When you side with a man, you stay with him, and if you can't do that you're like some animal.\" Such oppositional ideas lead to the film's violent conclusion, as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable. Bishop remembers his betrayals, most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton, in flashback, when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery, ostensibly to guard the hostages. Critic David Weddle writes that \"like that of Conrad's Lord Jim, Pike Bishop's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish.\""

It's also so full of violence\u2014of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story\u2014that it's going to prompt a lot of people who do not know the real effect of movie violence (as I do not) to write automatic condemnations of it.\" He observed, \"Although the movie's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos, corruption, and defeat\". About the actors, he commented particularly on William Holden: \"After years of giving bored performances in boring movies, Holden comes back gallantly in The Wild Bunch. He looks older and tired, but he has style, both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he's always done, not because he really wants the money but because there's simply nothing else to do.\"TIME also liked Holden's performance, describing it as his best since Stalag 17 (a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar), noting Robert Ryan gave \"the screen performance of his career\", and concluding that \"The Wild Bunch contains faults and mistakes\" (such as flashbacks \"introduced with surprising clumsiness\"), but \"its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah, along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn, belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers.\"In a 2002 retrospective Roger Ebert, who \"saw the original version at the world premiere in 1969, during the golden age of the junket, when Warner Bros. screened five of its new films in the Bahamas for 450 critics and reporters\", said that, back then, he had publicly declared the film a masterpiece during the junket's press conference, prompted by comments from \"a reporter from the Reader's Digest [who] got up to ask 'Why was this film ever made?'\" He compared the film to Pulp Fiction: \"praised and condemned with equal vehemence.\"\"What Citizen Kane was to movie lovers in 1941, The Wild Bunch was to cineastes in 1969,\" wrote film critic Michael Sragow, who added that Peckinpah had \"produced an American movie that equals or surpasses the best of Kurosawa: the Gotterdammerung of Westerns\".Today, the film holds a 91% rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 8.8/10 based on reviews from 65 critics with its consensus stating, \"The Wild Bunch is Sam Peckinpah's shocking, violent ballad to an old world and a dying genre\".The Wild Bunch was cited as cinematographer Roger Deakins's favorite film, and film director Kathryn Bigelow named it as one of her five favorite films. In the 2012 BFI poll for The Greatest Films of All Time, The Wild Bunch received 27 votes from critics and directors such as Michael Mann, Paul Schrader and Edgar Wright."

Much is made of the latter in a title leader, which sets forth that this day is one where woman is asserting herself in all the arts, and therefore it is time she undertook the direction of pictures.\nBut Lillian does not qualify as a particularly strong directress in this production. The story may have had something to do with that. It is not a world beater but with the action that Dorothy supplies it gets by with laughs.\nJames Rennie, who plays opposite the star, is the only member of the supporting cast who seems to have more than a \u2018bit\u2019 to do.

The commander of the raid had been Meg's husband, Major Elgin. The men had been led to believe that Elgin knew about secreted treasure in a house in Brittany which he owned before the war, and they are desperate to get their hands on it.

The fog-bound streets of London, the attempt by Morrison to blackmail Meg Elgin, the half-mad gang of street musicians and their thieves-kitchen hideout, evoke an authentically strange and eerie atmosphere. But with the appearance of the homicidal Jack Havoc, following a long and effective build-up, the film begins its marked deterioration into the commonplace. Regrettably, Tony Wright fails to convey the raw, exposed neurosis of the character, investing the part with more brawn than psychopathic insight. The rest of the playing is also highly variable, although there are several recognisable Allingham characters, notably the Scotland Yard men of Alec Clunes and Christopher Rhodes and the sinister Mrs. Cash, portrayed with considerable relish by Beatrice Varley.\"Variety called it \"An intriguing, nearly plausible  Screenplay has been made... With a sterling cast, and not over complicated plot, the result is good general entertainment... Tony Wright is making his mark in the cold killer type of roles and this one fits him like a glove.\""

Hustler then published a press release with a series of fake parody films (including Glee and FOX News); one of the films listed was an Avatar parody, and the producers at Hustler and Braun began serious discussions about the creation of an Avatar porn film. In March 2010, Hustler announced that Braun would be officially directing the film.Marc Star was tapped by Hustler to write the screenplay, where he came up with the idea of having the film take place after the end of the original Avatar, and to have the sex scenes shown through video logs before and during the original film. In order to avoid confusion with it actually being part of James Cameron's Avatar universe, the names of many objects in the universe are subtly changed to parody the original Avatar. The Na'vi are referred to as Na'bi, the planet Pandora was renamed to Panwhora, and instead of being after unobtainium, the humans are after viagratanium.In order to film the 3D sequences, Hustler contacted an outside company with 3D expertise to train their personnel and to lease their equipment. The director struggled to maneuver the 3D cameras during some of the sequences, but Braun was pleased with the end result. In order to achieve a look similar to that of the blue Na'vi from Avatar, makeup artists used gallons of blue paint on the Na'bi actresses in order to achieve a close look to that of the film. Prosthetics were attached to the performers' faces to simulate their alien nature. The film finished production in late June 2010.Hustler released the trailer for this film's unique texture and 3D effects in September 2010."

There, model Janet talks about her boyfriend Tony, a virgin philosopher who thinks sex is the root of all of modern society's evils. She complains that they do nothing but talk. In her car, Emanuelle gets hijacked by Tony, who threatens to kill her because of her sexual immorality. Emanuelle finds out about his sexual childhood trauma, argues for the cleanliness of sex, and starts to  fellate him. Panic-stricken, Tony runs away.\nAt her apartment, Emanuelle's boyfriend Bill plays with Tony's gun while she prepares to leave for a meeting. Craving sex, he playfully threatens to commit suicide with the gun and gets Emanuelle to postpone and have sex with him.\nPlanning to investigate billionaire Van Darren, Emanuelle visits a boxing gymnasium, where Joe, a former fighter turned trainer after being replaced as Van Darren's bodyguard, provides her with false papers. Van Darren's harem consists of twelve zodiacal women, the only current opening being for a Virgo. \nAt Van Darren's villa, Emanuelle infiltrates the harem. At the pool, she joins two of the women for a lesbian underwater game. Investigating the stables, she finds a weapons stash labeled \"horse shoes\". A guest there, the Duke of Elba Alfredo Elvize, has a monogamous attitude, unlike his host. In the evening, everyone watches a woman give a hand job to a horse. Alone with Van Darren, Emanuelle ridicules him for his power-centered and money-centered approach to sex. In the game room, she beats him at poker dice, taking a lot of money from him. She flees in Elvize's car and is invited to his Venetian palazzo.\nThere, the duke catches his wife with another man, and in turn, sleeps with Emanuelle. When his wife joins them, Emanuelle leaves, happily reuniting the couple. Emanuelle's boyfriend Bill later pays her a visit, the couple have sex during a rehearsal of the Spring concerto. At a party in the mansion, Emanuelle learns of a Caribbean island resort which offers beautiful men to sex-starved women. She also discovers the duke's hidden stash of forged paintings. When a pop out cake is opened, the party turns into an orgy, and Emanuelle takes pictures.\nBack at the Manhattan studio, Janet reveals that sex is all that Tony thinks of now. Alone again, Emanuelle has phone sex with Bill.\nEmanuelle poses as a client to infiltrate the island resort. She takes pictures of the couples and their sexual role plays. One of the women watches an 8 mm snuff film during sex, which shocks Emanuelle. Her cover is blown when a male sex worker recognizes her from one of her journals. She escapes by seducing, drugging and raping the resort's lesbian director and getting into the cab of the chauffeur with whom she came. They have sex in the car.\nThe trail of the snuff film leads her to a US senator in Washington, whom Emanuelle seduces. Presenting himself as a conservative patriot, he invites her to his studio. There, she convinces him of showing her his snuff film collection. Enamored, the senator has sex with her and drugs her drink. Emanuelle goes into a drug trip in which she travels with him to South America and witnesses torture and rape with her own eyes. In the morning, she promises the senator to visit him again.\nEmanuelle does not know if what she saw was real until her editor shows her pictures she took. Emanuelle sees it as the scoop of the century, but the editor tells her he has received orders from the top not to publish them. Angered, Emanuelle decides to take an indefinite break from her job.\nVacationing in an island with Bill, Emanuelle gets caught by a native tribe and is to become the local chieftain's twelfth wife. Bill confesses he has sold her for a shell necklace and beer. After the ceremony, a US film crew appears. The tribe are used as actors. Not wanting to take part in a film, Bill and Emanuelle elope, running along the beach in the sunset."

The documentary depicts the yearly journey of the emperor penguins of Antarctica. In autumn, all the penguins of breeding age (five years old and over) leave the ocean, which is their normal habitat, to walk inland to their ancestral breeding grounds. There, the penguins participate in a courtship that, if successful, results in the hatching of a chick. For the chick to survive, both parents must make multiple arduous journeys between the ocean and the breeding grounds over the ensuing months.\nIt took one year for the two isolated cinematographers Laurent Chalet and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Maison to shoot the documentary, which was shot around the French scientific base of Dumont d'Urville in Ad\u00e9lie Land.\nMarch of the Penguins was released in France on 26 January 2005 by Buena Vista International France and in the United States by Warner Independent Pictures on 24 June 2005. The documentary won the 2006 Oscar for Best Documentary Feature. On 1 June 2010, a home video release in France included the movie in the Disneynature collection. A direct sequel titled March of the Penguins 2: The Next Step (aka March of the Penguins 2: The Call) was released in France in 2017 by Disneynature. It was released in the United States exclusively on Hulu on 23 March 2018. It is named as one of the most successful documentaries in North America and France."

        "content": "The emperor penguins use a particular spot as their breeding ground because it is on ice that is solid year round with no danger of the ice becoming too soft to support the colony that exists. At the end of Antarctic summer, the breeding ground is only a few hundred meters away from the open water where the penguins can feed. However, by the end of winter, the breeding ground is over 100 kilometres (62 mi) away from the nearest open water. To reach it, all the penguins of breeding age must traverse this great distance.\nThe penguins practice serial monogamy within each breeding season. The female lays a single egg, and the co-operation of the parents is needed if the chick is to survive. After the female lays the egg, she transfers it to the feet of the waiting male with minimal exposure to the elements, as the intense cold could kill the developing embryo. The male tends to the egg when the female returns to the sea, now even farther away, both to feed herself and to obtain extra food for feeding her chick when she returns. The male has not eaten in two months and by the time the female leaves the hatching area, she will have lost a third of her body weight producing the egg.\nFor an additional two months, the males huddle together for warmth, and incubate their eggs. They endure temperatures approaching \u221262 \u00b0C (\u221280 \u00b0F), and their only source of water is snow that falls on the breeding ground. When the chicks hatch, the males have only a small meal to feed them, and if the female does not return, they must abandon their chick and return to the sea to feed themselves. By the time they return, the males have lost half their weight and have not eaten for four months. The chicks are also at risk from predatory birds such as northern giant petrels.The mother penguins come back and feed their young, while the male penguins go all the way back to sea (70 miles) to feed themselves. This gives the mothers time to feed their young ones and bond with them. Unfortunately, a fierce storm arrives and some of the chicks perish.\nThe death of a chick is tragic, but it does allow the parents to return to the sea to feed for the rest of the breeding season. When a mother penguin loses its young in a fierce storm, it sometimes attempts to steal another mother's chick. When the other parent returns, it can recognize the chick only from its unique call. Many parents die on the trip, killed by exhaustion or by predators (such as the leopard seal), dooming their chicks back at the breeding ground.\nThe ingenious fight against starvation is a recurring theme throughout the documentary. In one scene, near-starving chicks are shown taking sustenance out of their father's throat sacs, 11th-hour nourishment in the form of a milky, protein-rich substance secreted from a sac in the father's throat to feed their chicks in the event that circumstances require.\nThe parents must then tend to the chick for an additional four months, shuttling back and forth to the sea to provide food for their young. As spring progresses, the trip gets progressively easier as the ice melts and the distance to the sea decreases, until finally the parents can leave the chicks to fend for themselves."

Although the penguins' meeting place, one of four in Antarctica, was known to be near, the day on which it occurs is not known, so they had to be ready every day. Fortunately, the gathering that year was huge \u2013 more than 1,200 penguins, compared with the norm of a few hundred.\nFor cameras to operate at \u221240\u00b0, they had to use film and to load all the film for the day, as it was impossible to reload outside. Because of the isolation from any film studios, remembering each shot was necessary to ensure continuity and to make sure that all the necessary sequences were finished.The main challenge of making the documentary was the weather with temperatures between \u221250 and \u221260 \u00b0C (\u221258 and \u221276 \u00b0F). At dawn, the film crew would spend half an hour putting on six layers of clothes, and on some days they could not spend more than three hours outside.

        "content": "The documentary attracted some political and social commentary in which the penguins were viewed anthropomorphically as having similarities with, and even lessons for, human society. Michael Medved praised the documentary for promoting conservative family values by showing the value of stable parenthood. Medved's comments provoked responses by others, including Andrew Sullivan, who pointed out that the penguins are not in fact monogamous for more than one year, in reality practicing serial monogamy. Matt Walker of New Scientist pointed out that many emperor penguin \"adoptions\" of chicks are in fact kidnappings, as well as behaviours observed in other penguin species, such as ill treatment of weak chicks, prostitution, and ostracism of rare albino penguins. \"For instance, while it is true that emperor penguins often adopt each other's chicks, they do not always do so in a way the moralisers would approve of.\" Sullivan and Walker both conclude that trying to use animal behavior as an example for human behavior is a mistake.\nThe director, Luc Jacquet, has condemned such comparisons between penguins and humans. Asked by the San Diego Union Tribune to comment on the documentary's use as \"a metaphor for family values \u2013 the devotion to a mate, devotion to offspring, monogamy, self-denial\", Jaquet responded: \"I condemn this position. I find it intellectually dishonest to impose this viewpoint on something that's part of nature. It's amusing, but if you take the monogamy argument, from one season to the next, the divorce rate, if you will, is between 80 to 90 percent... the monogamy only lasts for the duration of one reproductive cycle. You have to let penguins be penguins and humans be humans.\"Some of the controversy over this may be media driven. Rich Lowry, editor of National Review, reported in the magazine's blog that the BBC \"have been harassing me for days over March of the Penguins ... about what, I'm not sure. I think to see if I would say on air that penguins are God's instruments to pull America back from the hell-fire, or something like that. As politely as I could I told her, 'Lady, they're just birds.'\"Another controversy involves those who feel that the emperor penguin's behavior can be viewed as an indication of intelligent design and those who consider it to be an example of evolution by natural selection in action. Steve Jones, professor of genetics at University College London, is quoted as saying, \"Supporters of intelligent design think that if they see something they don't understand, it must be God; they fail to recognise that they themselves are part of evolution. It appeals to ignorance, which is why there is a lot of it in American politics at the moment.\" Author Susan Jacoby claims in her 2008 book, The Age of American Unreason, that the distributors of the movie deliberately avoided using the word \"evolution\" in order to avoid backlash from the American religious right, and writes, \"As it happens, the emperor penguin is literally a textbook example, cited in college-level biology courses, of evolution by means of natural selection and random mutation. ... The financial wisdom of avoiding any mention of evolution was borne out at the box office ...\""

Some scenes were filmed nearly two years later in Staten Island at the request of producer Mishkin to pad out the short running time.\nBecause of the low budget, Milligan actually acted in at least two different roles during the production under two different names which included playing a gunsmith who sells Diana a pistol containing silver bullets, as well as a pawnshop owner named Mr. Micawber in the re-shot scenes involving Monica and the rats (which were added after Willard achieved popularity).The film was released on VHS by Midnight Video in the 1980s."

        "content": "Agni Natchathiram (transl.\u2009Scorching Star) is a 1988 Indian Tamil-language masala film that was written and directed by Mani Ratnam. The film stars Prabhu, Karthik, Amala and newcomer Nirosha, with Vijayakumar, Jayachitra, Sumithra, Tara, S. N. Lakshmi and G. Umapathy in supporting roles. Its story revolves around two half-brothers who come into conflict with each other due to their claims for legitimacy as sons of a common father.\nRatnam intended Agni Natchathiram to follow Mouna Ragam (1986); he completed the script but chose to prioritise Nayakan. Although some scenes were filmed during a break from Nayakan, production on Agni Natchathiram stalled for nearly a year and resumed in late 1987 after Nayakan's release. Agni Natchathiram was produced by Ratnam's brother G. Venkateswaran; it was filmed by P. C. Sreeram, and edited by B. Lenin and V. T. Vijayan.\nAgni Natchathiram was released on 15 April 1988, the week of the Tamil New Year festival Puthandu, and became a box-office success, running in theatres for over 200 days. The film won two Filmfare Awards South, three Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, and five Cinema Express Awards. It became a trendsetter in Tamil cinema, set a new standard in the use of lighting, and was remade in Hindi as Vansh (1992)."

Gautham's mother is Vishwanath's first wife Susheela, and Ashok's mother is Vishwanath's second wife Kamala. Both Gautham and Ashok inappropriately express their anger towards their father to others, and display open antipathy towards each other.\nGautham, a trainee Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, meets the Commissioner's daughter Anjali and they slowly become lovers. After graduating from the police academy, Gautham is appointed Assistant Commissioner in Madras. Around the same time, Ashok meets a mysterious girl and they also form a romantic relationship. Meanwhile, Vishwanath is appointed head of an inquiry commission to investigate a nefarious factory owner called Chidambaram.\nOne night, Ashok and his friends run into Gautham and Anjali; one of Ashok's friends teases Gautham, who arrests Ashok's friend on an invented charge. Enraged, Ashok and his gang throw stones at Gautham's house, accidentally injuring Susheela. The next day, Gautham arrests Ashok after provoking him into attacking him. Because Vishwanath is out of town, Susheela helps Kamala bail Ashok and offers snide, unsolicited advice about raising her children to be law-abiding. Meanwhile, Chidambaram repeatedly tries to bribe Vishwanath but is rebuffed and orders an assault on Vishwanath.\nOn the day when Ashok's sister Mallika is meeting a prospective groom's family for a matchmaking ceremony, Vishwanath fails to arrive, causing the groom's family to question the seriousness of the marriage between Kamala and Vishwanath. Ashok is enraged; he goes to Vishwanath's house and berates him but realises his paternal grandmother has died; Gautham throws him out. Later, Ashok learns his girlfriend also comes from a broken family. The Commissioner learns of Gautham's romance with Anjali and, based on his father's behaviour, doubts his monogamy.\nMallika runs into Gautham and Anjali on a commuter train; Gautham protects her from ruffians hired by Chidambaram to harass her, and he and Anjali accompany Mallika home safely. Mallika addresses Gautham as her elder brother but before he can respond, Ashok arrives and throws him out. Another altercation occurs at a wedding. The next day, they get into a huge brawl in public. Vishwanath berates them both, lamenting his public humiliation at his sons' behaviour.\nWhile Vishwanath is leaving his office, he is run over by a truck driven by one of Chidambaram's thugs and becomes comatose. Mutual fear brings the families closer as Susheela and Kamala wait by his bedside. Chidambaram arranges for Vishwanath's murder in the hospital. When the thugs attack, Gautham and Ashok foil the murder attempt by switching to the ambulance that Vishwanath was in. The next day, the brothers take the bandaged Vishwanath into the commission's office to submit evidence of Chidambaram's crimes. Chidambaram is arrested and the brothers high five each other."

In 2018, Rangan called Agni Natchathiram one of the best films in the masala genre, though he noted elements such as the loosu ponnu character played by Amala and the \"flashy, MTV-era cinematography\" did not age well.

Irma, his mistress for seven years, learns that her husband, who left for Australia years ago in search of a job, recently died there. Irma goes to the refinery and drops off Aldo's lunch, but does not stay to talk with him. Concerned about her behaviour, Aldo goes back to the house where they discuss her husband's death. Aldo suggests that after seven years they can finally get married and legitimise their daughter Rosina. The next day, Irma reveals that she has fallen in love with someone else a few months ago. Aldo is devastated and desperately tries to change her mind during the following days, but to no avail. When he slaps Irma in public, she declares this incident the end of their relationship.\nDistraught and disillusioned, Aldo leaves Goriano with Rosina, and the two start wandering throughout the Po Valley. They stop at the house of his former girlfriend Elvia, who works as a seamstress. He flatters her and helps repair a racing boat owned by the boyfriend of Elvia's younger sister Edera. Later he and Rosina join Elvia and Edera watching the river race, with Elvia holding Aldo's arm, but Aldo cannot hide his sadness for long and retracts. In his absence, Irma shows up at Elvia's house to deliver Aldo's valise and gives her the news of their separation. Elvia has little sympathy for Irma, believing she will regret throwing away her relationship with Aldo. That night Elvia and Aldo go to a dance, but Elvia asks to leave early so she can talk with him. Upset that Aldo returned to her only after Irma broke off their relationship, she asks him to move on. She also tells him she received his valise from Irma, but does not mention Irma's visit. Later that evening, Edera returns from the dance a little drunk and flirtatious, and she and Aldo kiss, but Aldo can only think of Irma. He leaves with his daughter early the next morning. Elvia tells her sister that she is sad about his departure, but remains calm on the outside.\nAldo and Rosina continue their travels. He is unsuccessful in finding a steady job, as there is no worksite with a school for Rosina nearby. The relationship between the two becomes strained, and when Rosina is almost hit by a car, he slaps her. They get a ride atop a petrol truck, but are forced to disembark before a police check point near a filling station, as passengers on the vehicle are not allowed. The driver tells Aldo that he will pick him up the following day when the police are not around. The filling station is run by Virginia, a young widow who lives with her father, a former farmer whose land she sold. She offers Aldo and Rosina the shack next to the station for the night. The next morning, Virginia offers Aldo a job. When the truck driver from the previous day approaches and asks if Aldo still wants the ride, he declines, choosing to stay. Soon, he and Virginia become lovers.\nRosina spends time with Virginia's father, singing old Anarchist anthems with him or throwing stones at the workers on the land which he previously owned. Enervated by her father's erratic behaviour, Virginia decides to put him in a retirement home. On the way back, Aldo and Virginia get into repeated quarrels, first because Virginia didn't have an eye on Rosina who ran away, and later because Rosina discovers them making love in an open field. Virginia starts crying, while Aldo utters Irma's name. Back at the house, Virginia suggests that they can no longer take care of Rosina, and soon Aldo puts her on a bus back to her mother. As the bus pulls away, Aldo runs after her, shouting that he loves her.\nSome time later, after leaving Virginia, Aldo finds work as a mechanic with a dredge crew. Listening to his boss' tales of travel, Aldo thinks about going to Venezuela and starts learning Spanish, but soon loses interest. He helps Andreina, a local prostitute living in a riverside shack, by forcing a doctor to examine her. When the police show up, Aldo, convinced that they are after him, rushes off, leaving behind his coat. Andreina finds the shack where Aldo is hiding, and they go for a walk, speaking about their past. Aldo recalls how he met Irma, and Andreina how she once almost got married but lost her unborn child.\nDuring the following days the rain falls heavy over the Po valley, and the river rises. The roof of the shack which Andreina and Aldo have moved into leaks, and both she and Aldo are starving. Infuriated about Aldo's lethargy, she goes to a nearby restaurant where she intends to sleep with the owner for food. Aldo follows and tries to get her to come back, but, confronted with her ongoing accusations, eventually walks out in silence, leaving behind a grieving Andreina. \nTaking a ride on a truck back to Goriano, Aldo meets Virginia at the filling station again. She gives him the valise he left behind and tells him about a postcard that arrived from Irma, which she says she has misplaced. In his anger, Aldo grabs Virginia, but finally lets go of her.\nArriving in Goriano, Aldo finds the town in turmoil over the construction of an airfield, which the inhabitants, threatened with dispossession, protest against. He walks through the deserted streets and sees Rosina entering Irma's house. Through the window, he sees Irma comforting a new child of her own, and walks away. Irma notices him and follows him to the deserted sugar refinery, whose workers have joined the protesters. Exhausted, Aldo climbs to the top of the refinery tower where he once worked. From the ground Irma calls up to him, and he turns and sees her down below. Appearing weak and disoriented, Aldo falls to his death as Irma cries out in horror. She kneels over his dead body, while the townspeople, heading for a rally, pass by in the background."

Antonioni later spoke of problems he had with some of his foreign actors: with Betsy Blair, because she wanted the meaning behind her complete dialogue explained in detail, and with Steve Cochran for regularly refusing to follow the director's instructions.Il grido premiered at the Locarno Film Festival on 14 July 1957 and in Rome on 29 November 1957. Of the films Antonioni had made up to this point, Il grido proved to be the least successful at the box office, earning a mere 25 million lire during its initial release.In English speaking countries, the film saw a delayed release, in late 1961 in the UK and in October 1962 in the US.

(Contrary to this, Seymour Chatman in Michaelangelo Antonioni: The Investigation cites Il grido as his \"first genuine critical success\".) In a later interview, Antonioni explained that he had been in a state of depression at the time, and that the film reflected this in a more pessimistic, desperate tone. As a result of the film's disappointing domestic reception, Antonioni was forced to cancel planned film projects and turn to theatre work, before returning to the cinema with his 1960 L'Avventura.On the occasion of the film's 1962 New York release (where it was screened in Italian with English subtitles), The New York Times critic A. H. Weiler saw an \"interesting, sometimes arresting slice of life at the lower depths\", but the outlook of its director as \"dismal and depressed\". F. Maurice Speed, writing for the British Film Review, was more enthusiastic, calling it \"brilliant\" and \"sad, fascinating and finely directed\"."

Club) saw Il grido as a transitional work between Antonioni's neorealist roots and his later films. In her 1984 analysis of Italian cinema, Mira Liehm writes that while Il grido contains neo-realist elements, \"particularly the interdependence between the landscapes and the characters and the emphasis on objects\", protagonist Aldo \"foreshadows Sandro in L'avventura and Giovanni in La notte in his refusal to acknowledge the fading of love\".Reviewers disagree about whether Aldo's death at the end is intentional or not. While French critic G\u00e9rard Gozlan (Positif) saw it as a suicide, Seymour Chatman argues that Aldo is overcome with vertigo as he stands atop the tower, causing him to fall to his death. Chatman found support in the original screenplay, which mentions that Aldo attempts to resist a sudden onset of vertigo as he looks down on the ground. Peter Brunette regards the ending as being ambiguous: Aldo's death can be viewed either as caused by a fall or a deliberate jump.Liehm, Brunette and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith also point out that as an exception in Antonioni's films, the protagonist of Il grido is a member of the working class instead of the bourgeoisie, an observation confirmed by the director in an interview in which he stated that only Il grido and his early documentary short Gente del Po (1947) were about working class concerns."

While he and his half-Pawnee son, Hawk, are hunting, the company's camp is attacked by an Arikara war party which is seeking to recover its chief's abducted daughter, Powaqa. Many of the trappers are killed during the fight, and the rest of them escape onto a boat. Guided by Glass, the survivors begin a trek to Fort Kiowa on foot because Glass believes that traveling downriver will make them vulnerable. After docking, the crew stash their pelts near the shore.\nWhile he is scouting game, Glass is mauled and left near death by a female grizzly bear which is guarding its cubs. Trapper John Fitzgerald, fearing another Arikara attack, argues that the group must mercy-kill Glass and keep moving. Henry agrees, but he is unable to pull the trigger. Instead, he offers money in order to pay someone to stay with Glass and bury him after he dies. When the only volunteers are Hawk and the young Jim Bridger, Fitzgerald agrees to stay for money, in order to recoup his losses from the abandoned pelts.\nAfter the others leave, Fitzgerald attempts to smother Glass but is stopped by Hawk, who intervenes. Hawk threatens to shoot Fitzgerald and shouts for Bridger, who is away gathering water so Fitzgerald stabs Hawk to death as Glass watches helplessly. The next morning, Fitzgerald convinces Bridger, who is unaware of Hawk's murder, that the Arikara are approaching and they must abandon Glass. At first, Bridger protests, but he ultimately follows Fitzgerald after the latter leaves Glass half-buried alive in a makeshift grave. Bridger leaves his canteen, in which he engraved a spiral symbol, with Glass. After they depart, Fitzgerald admits that he lied about the approaching Arikara. When Fitzgerald and Bridger later meet Henry at the fort, Fitzgerald tells Henry that Glass died and Hawk vanished. Bridger is complicit in the lie about Glass's death, but he knows nothing about Hawk's murder.\nGlass begins his arduous journey through the wilderness. He performs a crude cauterization of his wounds and eludes the pursuing Arikara by jumping into river rapids. He later encounters Pawnee refugee Hikuc, who says that \"revenge is in the Creator's hands.\" The men share bison meat and travel. As a storm approaches, Hikuc constructs a makeshift sweat lodge for a feverish Glass to shelter in. After a hallucinogenic experience in the lodge, Glass emerges to discover that his wounds are healing, but French hunters have lynched Hikuc. He infiltrates their camp and sees the leader raping Powaqa. Glass frees her, and while she castrates her rapist, he kills several hunters, and recovers Hikuc's horse. The following day, Glass is ambushed and driven over a cliff on his horse by the Arikara. He survives the stormy night by eviscerating the dead horse and sheltering inside its carcass.\nA frightened French survivor staggers into Fort Kiowa, and Bridger recognizes his spiral engraved canteen as Glass's. Believing that it might be a surviving Hawk, Henry organizes a search party. Realizing that Glass is alive, Fitzgerald empties the outpost's safe and flees. The search party finds the exhausted Glass. Furious, Henry orders the arrest of Bridger, but Glass vouches for Bridger by stating that he was not present when Fitzgerald murdered Hawk and he was later deceived and threatened by the higher-ranking Fitzgerald. Glass and Henry set out in pursuit of Fitzgerald.\nAfter the two men split up, Fitzgerald ambushes, kills, and scalps Henry. Glass finds Henry's corpse, places it on his horse in an attempt to act as a decoy, and shoots Fitzgerald in the arm. He pursues Fitzgerald to a riverbank, where they engage in a brutal fight. Glass is about to kill Fitzgerald, but he spots a band of Arikara downstream. He remembers Hikuc's words and pushes Fitzgerald downstream into the hands of the Arikara. Their chief Elk Dog kills and scalps Fitzgerald, and the Arikara (who have found Powaqa) spare Glass. Glass retreats into the mountains, where he is visited by his wife's spirit."

Dimock argues that the film reinterprets the concept of \"half-breeds\" from a derogatory idea that Cooper despised to an aesthetic way in which to see the world. She compared both works' protagonists\u2014Glass and Hawk-eye\u2014as literary foils, with Glass living an inversion of the latter's biography and perspective.In the documentary A World Unseen, the director stated that for The Revenant's main themes, he revisits the issues and concerns of intense parental and filial relations, which are readily recognizable as a recurrent theme from his previous works. Regarding the theme of revenge, he mentioned that the approach of vengeance in the film needs to be significantly tempered by anyone who would want to see vengeance as either an effective or useful moral to be applied in life. In the end, he said, there can only be a disappointment and lack of fulfillment for anyone who looks to revenge as providing a higher purpose for living or a life-defining purpose."

It has been suggested the real Glass had such a relationship, but there's no firm evidence\u2014and no evidence that he had any children. ... As for the ending, it has been changed in one significant way: in real life, nobody got killed.\"Canadian actor Roy Dupuis was strongly critical of the portrayal of French-Canadian voyageurs as murderous rapists. Dupuis was originally offered a role as a voyageur, but he rejected it due to perceptions of anti-French bias and historical inaccuracies. According to Allan Greer, the Canada Research Chair of colonial North America, \"generally the American traders had a worse reputation than the Canadians.\"The filmmakers made a special point of emphasizing the importance of historical issues of ethnicity approached in the movie and represented in the mixed ethnic background of Hugh Glass's son portrayed in the film (portrayed as half Pawnee by Glass's wife) as relating to his own life and his identification with ethnic concerns. The director has referred to having encountered constant xenophobia and stated that: \"These constant and relentless xenophobic (comments) have been widely spread by the media without shame, embraced and cheered by leaders and communities around the US. The foundation of all this is so outrageous that it can easily be minimized as an SNL sketch, a mere entertainment, a joke ... I debated with myself, if I should bring up this uncomfortable subject tonight but in light of the constant and relentless xenophobic comments that have been expressed recently against my Mexican fellows, it is inevitable.\"Bruce Bradley of True West Magazine pointed out several anachronisms hinted in the film such as John Fitzgerald talking about his father having friends in the Texas Rangers and about going to Texas and joining the army himself. However, in 1823, Texas was still part of Mexico and therefore would not have had an American army, let alone the Texas Rangers. Another example being Hugh Glass discovering a mountain of buffalo skulls while working his way to Fort Kiowa despite the buffalo slaughter not occurring until the 1870s."

The film follows a teenage actress who is encouraged by her theater director to blur the lines between the character she is playing and her actual identity. The film is known for its experimental visuals and the improvisational process Decker used to create the story, not unlike the characters themselves.\nThe film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2018. It was released on August 10, 2018, by Oscilloscope Laboratories. The film received critical acclaim, particularly for Howard's performance, which was hailed by IndieWire as one of the 50 best performances of the 2010s decade."

        "content": "Madeline is a lonely teenager who is part of a professional acting ensemble creating an experimental theater performance about The Three Little Pigs using improvisation. She enjoys the company of the other actors and their director Evangeline, and dreads having to go home to her mother Regina who doesn't understand Madeline and often starts arguments. One day at rehearsal, Madeline confesses to Evangeline that she had a dream in which she placed a hot iron on her mother. Struck by this dream, Evangeline decides to have the performers recreate it in an improv exercise. Madeline gets overwhelmed at how her life is conflating with her art and wanders out of the theater alone while Regina looks for her. After she finds Madeline, Regina discovers that Madeline's prescription for an unspecified mental illness has run out, and she struggles to get it quickly refilled.\nEvangeline gradually makes Madeline's life the central focus of the theater performance they are devising. During a promotional photoshoot, Evangeline asks Regina to pose in the photo with Madeline. One rehearsal ends early, so Madeline goes to Evangeline's house for a birthday party, where she shows off her acting skills to the uncomfortable guests and hits on Evangeline's husband. After speaking with Evangeline about their mutual feelings of self-consciousness and vulnerability, Madeline reveals that she wants to leave the group and Evangeline agrees that Madeline should take a break from acting for a bit.\nMadeline is relieved at her new found creative freedom but is dismayed when Evangeline stops by Madeline's house. She and Regina end up bonding over a couple glasses of wine, and Evangeline convinces Regina that she would be an excellent actor if she tried it. She tells Regina to stop by rehearsal the next day. All three women show up to the rehearsal, and Evangeline has them do an exercise where everyone pretends to be Regina, but Madeline's version of her mother is too real and it hits a nerve: Regina leaves the rehearsal crying.\nEvangeline loves how real the emotions are, and asks the performers to recreate that scene again while she takes an important phone call outside. The performers are disgusted by the way Evangeline has been exploiting Madeline's emotions and identity, and they lock the door. They quickly devise a performance for Evangeline: a confrontational journey through the winding rehearsal building.\nAt first Evangeline objects to being shoved around by everyone, but eventually despite struggling, she is used as part of the performance. The troupe ends up outside in the street, all dancing together in the sunlight as Madeline walks in the opposite direction."

        "content": "Josephine Decker directed the film and wrote its screenplay. Camera work was handled by Ashley Connor, and music was composed by Caroline Shaw. The film's producers were Krista Parris and Elizabeth Rao.Decker and Howard first met in 2014 at a teen arts festival that the director was judging. 15-year-old Howard performed a monologue from Blackbird by David Harrower, and Decker was so moved by the performance that she began to cry, which caused Howard to cry, too. Decker told her that it was the best performance she'd ever seen, and that she'd like them to work together on a film.The film's story began as a fictionalized telling of Howard's own life, but Decker also wanted to explore her own anxieties as an artist. In her previous work Bi the Way and Flames, she had experiences where artists told others' stories in ways that she felt were exploitative, and she wanted to explore whether it would be possible to tell someone else's story faithfully.\nIn 2014, she began a series of workshops to devise the story, based on techniques she had learned at the Pig Iron Theatre Company in Philadelphia and the School of Making Thinking. Decker, Howard, and eleven other actors met about nine different times over the course of seven months. They used improvisation to create a variety of different scenes, many of which never ended up in the final film, and explored each performer's personal experiences, such as with mental illness. Cinematographer Ashley Connor also participated in some of the workshops because Decker wanted the camera to also be treated as a character. After all the workshops, Decker sat down and wrote a script that incorporated the best scenes they had created. In one draft of the script, she included a real-life event that had happened between her and Howard, and when she realized that it had crossed a line between the character Madeline and the actual Helena Howard, she decided to take the script in a more fictional direction. Decker realized from that experience that the character Evangeline would have enjoyed crossing boundaries like that, so she started incorporating that desire into her character.Decker continued this collaborative style during production. At the beginning of each day of shooting, the cast and crew met for a short meditation and a chance for anyone to voice concerns they had with the production process. Many of the scenes were improvised, so Connor and gaffer David April lit the sets in such a way that the actors and camera could freely move anywhere without a light being in the shot. The visual style of the film incorporated camera techniques that Connor and Decker had discovered working on previous films together. Connor created a custom camera rig that allowed her to manipulate the focus in new ways, which Chris O'Falt of Indiewire described as \"an almost liquid-like aspect to the focus, and the image if often slightly doubled or warped, while out-of-focus translucent objects come into the edges of frame to cause pockets of soft, sometimes colorful blurring.\"Harrison Atkins was the editor for the first four months of post production and made over a hundred different cuts of the movie exploring various ways the story could be told, but when he had to leave to work on a different show, Decker took on the editing herself. Six months went by and she still wasn't satisfied with the film, so she brought on producer Liz Rao to help with editing for five weeks. With only two weeks left until the deadline for submitting to the Sundance Film Festival, Decker realized there was still a major problem with the ending, so she brought on David Barker for some last-minute changes. Spike Jonze and Mike Mills also offered advice during post-production."

Saroja Devi while K. A. Thangavelu, Vijayakumari, M. Saroja, S. D. Subbulakshmi, A. Nageswara Rao and M. N. Nambiar play supporting roles. A triangular love story, it is about two close sisters whose lives turn upside down when they both fall in love with the same man. Out of respect, the younger sister decides to sacrifice her love, unknown to the elder sister.\nKalyana Parisu was the directorial debut of Sridhar, who co-produced it with his partners S. Krishnamoorthy and T. Govindarajan under Venus Pictures. It also marked the cinematic debut of T. A. Sadagoppan (later known as Chitralaya Gopu) who worked as associate writer, and the debut of A. M. Rajah as a music composer in Tamil. Cinematography was handled by A. Vincent, and editing by N. M. Shankar.\nKalyana Parisu was released on 9 April 1959. It was critically acclaimed, particularly for eschewing formulaic Tamil cinema conventions like long dialogues and fixed-point cinematography in favour of short verses with simple words and camera mobility. The film was commercially successful, running for over 25 weeks in theatres and thereby becoming a silver jubilee film. At the 7th National Film Awards, it won the Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film in Tamil.\nKalyana Parisu emerged a milestone in Tamil cinema, and the breakthrough for Saroja Devi and Rajah. Its success led to Sridhar launching his own production company Chitralaya, and set the pattern for his later works in which he repeated the motif of the eternal triangle and unrequited love. The comedy subplot written by Gopu involving Thangavelu and M. Saroja gained popularity, and was sold separately on audio cassettes and vinyl records. The film was later remade by Sridhar in Telugu as Pelli Kanuka (1960) and Hindi as Nazrana (1961), and in Malayalam by J. Sasikumar as Sammanam (1975)."

When Sridhar told Kalyanasundaram told the complete storyline of Kalyana Parisu in detail, Kalyanasundaram felt it was too \"longwinded\" and summed it up in two lines: \"Kaathalile tholviyutraal kanni oruthi, kalangukiral avanai nenjil niruthi\" (A virgin had lost her love, she is heartbroken about him). Sridhar was surprised at this since he had struggled to develop the storyline for months. Though initially depressed, he felt the lines were true and asked Kalyanasundaram to develop them into a song; the result was \"Kaathalile Tholviyutraal\". According to Sridhar, the song was originally \"meant as a criticism! So, one shouldn't be scared of criticism. We should use it to catalyze our imagination.\" The Diwali-themed song \"Unnaikkandu Naanada\" is set in Bilahari, a Carnatic raga. The song \"Tea Tea Tea\", sung by Sirkazhi Govindarajan, is picturised on Sampath, a tea seller, and deviated from the divine, philosophical songs Govindarajan was generally known for. The film follows a then convention of Tamil cinema to feature the same song sung twice: once in joy and once in sorrow.A version of the soundtrack released by Odeon Records in 1983 includes only four songs: \"Thullatha Manamum\", P. Susheela's version of \"Unnaikkandu Naanada\" (listed as \"Unnaikandu\"), \"Vaadikkai Maranthathum\" and \"Mangayar Mugathil\" (listed as \"Akkalukku Valaikappu\"). A version released by EMI in 1995 includes all songs except \"Tea Tea Tea\", and \"Mangayar Mugathil\" is listed as \"Mangayar Mugathil (Akkalukku)\". The songs \"Kaathalile Tholviyutraal\" and \"Kaathalile Tholviyutraan\" are listed as two separate tracks in this version; however, in the tracklist released by Saregama in 2015, they are listed as a single merged track."

With a newly raised bounty on Tae-goo, a new chase begins as he flees across the Manchurian desert."

The Korean theatrical cut is 136 minutes long and the international cut is 129 minutes long. The Korean ending is more \"upbeat\" than the international version, including several more minutes of footage. In the alternative ending, The Weird, Tae-goo, gets up. He reveals the thick metal sheet he hid under his quilted jacket and limps over to demolish the corpse of Chang-yi, The Bad. While doing so, he discovers diamonds in Chang-yi's pocket and giggles with delight before realising he's surrounded by the Japanese army. Inadvertently lighting a stick of dynamite, Tae-goo scares off the Japanese and dives for cover after realising it was lit. Over the credits, Tae-goo sets off to continue hunting for the treasure with his bounty multiplied sevenfold, while The Good, Do-won, vindictively pursues him. The ending of the international version reflects the end that director Kim Jee-woon originally wanted.In the United Kingdom, the British Board of Film Classification ordered five seconds of cuts to the cinema release due to scenes of horse falls judged to be animal cruelty that violated the Cinematograph Films (Animals) Act 1937."

It also received screenings at the Toronto International Film Festival, Hawaii International Film Festival, Sitges Film Festival, Chicago International Film Festival, and the London Film Festival.\nAmerican distribution rights were acquired by IFC Films, who released it in theaters on a limited basis on April 23, 2010.The Good, the Bad, the Weird received generally positive reviews. Review aggregating website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 84% of 60 sampled critics gave the film positive reviews and that it got a rating average of 7.2 out of 10 stating that \"Whilst never taking itself too seriously, this riotous and rollicking Sergio Leone-inspired Korean Western is serious fun.\" On Metacritic, it received generally favorable reviews with a total score of 69. Variety said that \"East meets West meets East again, with palate-tingling results, in 'The Good the Bad the Weird', a kimchi Western that draws shamelessly on its spaghetti forebears but remains utterly, bracingly Korean\" awarding the film 3.5 out of 5 stars.The A.V. Club gave it a B+ saying that \"The story\u2019s many advances and reversals can be hard to follow at times, but this isn\u2019t really a movie where plot is paramount. Everything boils down to the action, and what that action means\". The New York Post gave it a four star rating out of five stating that \"The Good, the Bad, the Weird may owe a lot to other films but it is always fresh and never boring\". Empire magazine gave it a three star rating out of five commenting that \"A tangled narrative and damp -squib ending detract from an otherwise joyous Spaghetti Eastern Western.\" Time Out critic Tom Huddlestone stated that \"This is filmmaking as rodeo ride: bruising and ultimately pointless, but thrilling as hell while it lasts\" and awarded the film four out of five stars. The Hollywood Reporter gave it a positive review declaring the film \"a jaunty, happy-go-lucky adventure that packs a fistful of dynamite in the spectacular showdown.\"\nOn the other hand, there were criticism directed towards the excessive violence and the simplicity of the script. In particular, the Village Voice's Nicolas Rapold mentioned that \"Kim's filmmaking is generally cartoonish in a bad sense, as he squanders his set pieces, flashbacks, and other attention-getting with sometimes downright wretched staging\" while The Boston Globe wrote that the film \"goes for shallow pop instead of narrative depth. It's a lot of fun before it wears you out, and it wears you out sooner than it should.\" Additionally, Robert Abele from the Los Angeles Times mentioned that \"Knives, explosions and knockabout humor have been added to taste. As vigorously staged as it all is -- sometimes confusingly, occasionally with camera-torqueing flair and impressive stuntwork -- the urge to thrill grows wearisome. Were audience members to be included as a collective character as well, they'd be 'The Tired'.\""

Bhanupratap has done yeoman's service not only for the people of Bharatpur but also for those of eighteen neighboring villages. He lives in a mansion with his wife Sharda and his three sons Karan, Varun, and Heera. Heera, the youngest one, lives like a servant because of his illiteracy. Hated by Bhanupratap, Heera is prohibited from being involved in familial matters and only performs menial activities. Despite being treated terribly, Heera loves his father unconditionally. Heera is only loved by Sharda and Heera's close friend Dharmendra (Mindra), a servant in the house.\nDays before the wedding of Bhanupratap's daughter, the groom visits the house with his sister Radha. Believing Heera to be a simple servant, Radha makes him do various chores. On the day of the wedding, Radha is shocked to learn the truth from her father. Curious, she makes Mindra tell her about Heera's past.\nDuring his childhood, Heera constantly failed at school. Enamored, he used to go there only to see Gauri, a girl whom Bhanupratap adopted after her parents' death. One day, a teacher thrashed Gauri, causing Heera to discontinue his academic studies. Thinking that Heera's company would hamper Gauri's studies, Bhanupratap sent her to a boarding school in the city. When Heera and Gauri came of age, Bhanupratap planned their marriage. After learning of this, Gauri attempted suicide and Heera rescued her. Gauri then admitted she would rather die than marry an illiterate man like him. To save Gauri from blame, Heera took the responsibility of saying no to the marriage. Bhanupratap, misunderstanding the situation, thought Heera only had lust for Gauri. This made him hate Heera even more. Later, Gauri married a rich man. Moved by Heera's story, Radha proposes to him, and he accepts.\nDeshraj Thakur, another zamindar in Bharatpur, schemes to devastate Bhanupratap and his family by making Radha his daughter-in-law. If Radha is married to Deshraj's son Arjun, Radha's lawyer father will do whatever Deshraj wants. In this way, he will be able to get ahead of Bhanupratap. Radha's mother approves of the alliance and asks Bhanupratap to make Heera leave Radha. Bhanupratap gives two choices to Heera: he can either be with Radha or gain his father's respect again. Mindra convinces Heera to accept Radha as his wife, saying only a fortunate few find true love like him. On the day of Radha's marriage to Arjun, Heera takes Radha away with him and marries her. This enrages Bhanupratap, who disowns Heera.\nHeera and Radha move into Mindra's house on the outskirts of the village. He later gets a job as a labourer in a transport company. Radha eventually encourages Heera to start his own business. With the money lent by her uncle Ranjeet, Heera establishes a transport company under the name of his father. Soon, Heera becomes a rich & respected person while Radha clears UPSC exam and is appointed as the District Collector as an IAS officer. The couple also has a son, named after Heera\u2019s father (nicknamed Sonu). Bhanupratap, despite knowing that Heera and his family have moved up the social strata, continues to hate them. Heera fulfills his father's dream of setting up a hospital for the poor. During its inauguration, Heera publicly owes his success to his father, who, he believes, had expelled him from home so that he learned to fend for himself. Surreptitiously attending the ceremony, Bhanupratap hears this.\nWhile reconsidering his life decisions, he accidentally meets Sonu outside his school and starts secretly spending time with him. After learning about this, Heera hands some Kheer to his son, telling him to give it to his \"friend\" next time they meet. Meanwhile, Sharda urges Bhanupratap to accept Heera back into the family. Bhanupratap, hating himself for the way he treated Heera, phones him. However, before being able to speak a word, he starts vomiting blood and becomes ill. Bhanupratap is hospitalized and Deshraj publicly accuses Heera of trying to kill his father with the poisoned Kheer, because of his expulsion from the family. While Deshraj and his henchmen assault Heera, Bhanupratap recovers and goes to his rescue. There, Bhanupratap reveals that the Kheer was poisoned by Deshraj himself. Bhanupratap and Heera fight against their attackers until Deshraj confesses his crime and begs for forgiveness.\nThe kith and kin of Bhanupratap's family then assemble in front of the mansion, where Bhanupratap embraces Heera."

Raja rejects the proposal and Govindayya offers to find a suitable bridegroom for Ammadu if Raja marries Chitti. Raja rejects the proposal and with Kundu he sets out to find a suitable bridegroom for Ammadu.\nIn a distant village, Raja and Kundu meet Dhoopati Viyyanna, a zamindar and the president of the panchayat. Viyyanna is a complex character of declining fortunes and a generous spirit who believes in respecting his guests. Raja and Viyyanna's daughter Savitri fall in love and their wedding is quickly arranged. Viyyanna also finds a bridegroom named Venkata Ramana, a pleader living in Madras, for Ammadu.

Prasad and financed by their company Vijaya Productions. Pelli Chesi Choodu was made as a bilingual film; it was shot simultaneously in Telugu and Tamil, with the Tamil version titled Kalyanam Panni Paar, the first Tamil film directed by Prasad. Chakrapani wrote the film's script, which was based on the negative effects of the dowry system in India. Marcus Bartley was recruited as the cinematographer and the film was edited by  C. P. Jambulingam and M. S. Money. Madhavapeddi Gokhale and Kaladhar were the film's art directors, and the music score was composed by Ghantasala. Chalapathi Rao and Jagannadham were the production executives. Pasumarthi Krishnamurthy choreographed the song sequences. T. Prakash Rao worked as an assistant director under Prasad; Rao directed Palletooru (1952) during the post-production phase of Pelli Chesi Choodu. Kalyanam Panni Paar was partly colourised using Gevacolor.N. T. Rama Rao and G. Varalakshmi were chosen as one of the leading pairs of actors. During the songs' shoot, Ghantasala taught Rama Rao to play the harmonium and gave him a few music lessons so he would look believable in the film. Yandamuri Jogarao and Savitri, who had played minor roles in Shavukar and Pathala Bhairavi, were chosen as the other leading pair. In playing the role of the zamindar, S. V. Ranga Rao exhibited a strange body language, inspired by a stranger he had observed at a railway station. Sivarama Krishnayya and C. V. V. Panthulu played the role of Rama Rao's father in the Telugu and Tamil versions. Padmanabham played two roles; a postman and Ranga Rao's friend.The child artists in the film were members of Nyapathi Raghavarao's 'Balanandam' troupe. They were trained by Gnapadi Kameswara Rao, whose nephew Gade Balakrishna \"Kundu\" Rao played a key role in the film's Telugu and Tamil versions. Vijaya Productions hired actors on a monthly salaried basis for this film; one of these was M. Mallikarjuna Rao, who later directed films Prameelarjuneeyam (1965), Muhurtha Balam (1969), and Gudachari 116 (1976). Differences between Chakrapani and Varalakshmi occurred during the last stage of principal photography. Chakrapani wanted to replace Varalakshmi with Anjali Devi and reshoot the entire film. However, Devi mediated between them and resolved the differences.Differences between Rama Rao and Varalakshmi due to the latter's tantrums, also occurred. When Varalakshmi refused to touch Rama Rao's feet in the scene in which his father drags him from the marriage hall, Prasad asked Nagi Reddy's son B. L. N. Prasad\u2014the second assistant cameraman working under Bartley\u2014to wear a dhoti and stand before her. Chakrapani liked a scene in a play in which a group of police officers in ascending hierarchy, each junior gave up his chair for the senior; he used the same idea in Savitri's marriage sequences in the film. Similarly, Prasad incorporated part of a stage play enacted by children into the film, which Nagi Reddy's son Venkatarami Reddy was a part of. Prasad also made a cameo appearance in the film. Mohan Kanda, who later became the Chief Secretary of Andhra Pradesh before its bifurcation, also appeared in the film as a child artist. The final reel length of both versions was 5,243 metres (17,201 ft)."

He learns that his father is suffering from pancreatic cancer and has roughly a month or more to live. Subrahmanyam reveals his name as Ramesh Chandra Prasad, who was once London's richest entrepreneur, who lost all his wealth because of a cunning man, Krishna Murthy Kautilya, who made his worldwide business empire cheating Ramesh Chandra. He was then forced to change his name to Subrahmanyam and got rich again after years of work. Subrahmanyam requests his three sons to take revenge on his behalf. \nSubramanyam's first son lies to him that he has filed a lawsuit against Krishna Murthy to pacify him, but Abhiram takes matters into his own hands. He sets 30 days to bring down Krishna Murthy and hires three youngsters who are shown to love their fathers dearly. He targets Krishnamurty's daughter Divyanka aka Divya to reach him. Divya reappropriates Abhiram's feelings after saving her from kidnapping and spending every last penny of their family bank balance to buy her a \u20b925 crore (US$3.1 million) worth of painting. Abhiram meets Krishnamurty at Divya's birthday party, but Krishna Murthy turns out to be aware of Abhiram's intentions. Subrahmanyam gets admitted to the hospital as his condition turns critical. \nAbhiram's brothers cut ties with him after they came to know that Abhiram wasted their property on the painting. Krishna Murthy plants a bug in Abhiram's lair, because of which he discovers their plans, and Divya too learns of Abhiram's intentions and breaks up with him. Krishna Murthy had grabbed the People Oil and Natural Gas project, which is one of the largest oil and gas bases in Europe belonging to a businessman Kapil Sinha in Spain, to where he goes with Divya. Abhiram follows them with his group but gets kidnapped by Divya's henchman. She does so as she wants to find his plans of ruining her father. Abhiram regains Divya's love and also gets her to meet her mother in prison, whom she had not met since she was 4 years old, and reveals her mysterious dream. \nKrishnamurthy had planted drugs in their bag during one of their travels, but the airport security found the bag with Divya's mother when Krishna Murthy and Divya were in the washroom. Krishna Murthy leaves his wife to save himself and his daughter. Divya begins to loathe her father. Krishna Murthy, under the guise of Abhiram, sends a false message to Abhiram's elder brother Vamsi that his father has died. Vamsi rushes to the hospital to meet Abhiram who says that he did not send any message. His brother becomes furious. Immediately, Abhiram receives a bouquet sent by Krishna Murthy where he finds a deathstalker in it and gets bitten by it. Krishna Murthy sends some clues to Abhiram to find the antidote which is not available in any pharmacy. In a series of events, the lives of all, Abhiram and his brothers, are endangered. Abhiram finds the antidote and saves his brothers but he gets arrested in a medical drug case. His elder brother bails him out and Abhiram's brothers patch up with him.\nMeanwhile, it turns out that the painting gifted to Krishna Murthy had a camera in it and that Abhiram was also aware of Krishna Murthy's plans. Abhiram accesses Krishna Murthy's bank number, transferring \u20b940,000 crore (US$5.0 billion) to his family account. It is also revealed that the People Oil and Natural Gas land that Krishna Murthy grabbed was no real gas land and the gas there was given by tunnels planted by Abhiram's KMC company: Krishna Murthy Mosam Chese company (lit.\u2009'Cheating Krishna Murthy Company'). Kapil is revealed to be Satpal Singh, Subrahmanyam's ex-adviser and best friend, who had been supporting Abhiram since the beginning. Krishna Murthy becomes of the same condition as Ramesh Chandra Prasad and absconds and changes his identity to Subrahmanyam. Divya and her mother move in with Abhiram's family, but sadly, Ramesh Chandra succumbs to his disease and dies. Abhiram still does not cry as he thinks that his father will go the day he cries."

Murphy reaches the shore and finds a missionary settlement on the Orinoco in Venezuela, where he is treated by the pacifist Quaker Dr. Hayden.\nWhen Murphy discovers that the U-boat is hiding farther up river under the cover of the jungle, he obsessively plots to sink it by any means, including by using a surviving Grumman J2F Duck floatplane from the Mount Kyle. The floatplane's wounded pilot was shot dead in his hospital bed by the U-boat captain in order to preserve the secret of the sub's location and of the war crimes committed by the shooting of survivors in the water.\nMurphy tries to fly the aircraft on the choppy river water and learns how to manipulate the controls by trial and error. He soon finds the U-boat's hiding place and attempts to bomb it using homemade Molotov cocktail bombs, but his effort fails and the mission settlement is destroyed in retaliation. Later, word comes that Germany has surrendered, but Murphy is obsessed with revenge and plans to ram the U-boat with a floating crane owned by Louis, a friendly Frenchman. This attempt also fails when the U-boat dives under him. However, the submerged U-boat is ensnared in a mud bank. Murphy uses the crane to recover an unexploded torpedo fired earlier by the U-boat and drops it on the trapped crew, killing them. Murphy is also killed as the explosion from the torpedo causes the crane jib to pin him to the deck as the floating crane sinks to the river bed."

While helping him, Jenny notices a large sculpture resembling abstract flames in a corner and recognizes it as her brother's work. The gallery owner says the artist is known as \"The Seeker\", an itinerant preacher. Ex-band member Dave may know The Seeker's current whereabouts. Dave's information leads the gang to a junkyard, where Jenny recognizes her brother's car. A group of thugs who frequent the junkyard accost the group and threaten to rape Jenny. Violence ensues, and the group barely escape with their lives.\nIn Stoney's crowded home, everyday hippie life is less than ideal. The residents are all involved in contemplation, sex, sleeping, dancing or decorating, but with little cleaning or maintenance. Jenny tries to wash the mountain of dishes in the kitchen and finds that the plumbing is broken. Frustrated, she goes for a walk. Stoney goes to find her and ends up at the art gallery, where he hears breaking glass and slips inside. Steve, AKA The Seeker, has returned to the art gallery to pick up his sculpture. He is glad that Jenny is looking for him, but says he is on drugs and wants to be sober when they meet. He tells Stoney that Jenny's deafness is the result of trauma caused by their abusive mother.\nThe performance at the Ballroom is a success. The Seeker shows up, hoping to see Jenny, but the junkyard thugs chase him back to his home. At an after-show party, Dave offers Jenny a glass of orange juice spiked with STP. Stoney charges in and angrily shouts at Jenny. Heartbroken, Jenny accepts Dave's glass of fruit juice and drinks nearly all of it. Jenny again explains her search for Steve, and Dave pulls a note from his pocket containing an address and the words \"God is in the flame.\" Jenny runs out and takes a streetcar to the address, with Stoney and Dave, now tripping, close behind.\nPursued by the junkyard thugs back to his home, Steve lights a fire inside his shrine. Jenny arrives just in time to see him standing in the middle of the flames, absorbed in prayer; he sees her, but merely smiles and waves. In her grief and confusion, she runs up to the roof, hallucinating wildly, ending up at the middle of the Golden Gate Bridge with cars coming at her from both directions.

He resigns from the priesthood. Hours later, the city is bombarded and he takes shelter with a mysterious, beautiful woman named Soledad.\nAs night falls, Loyalist speakers induce a mob to torch the church, and its ranking cleric moves to hide the Blood of St. John relic by giving his deputy the task of taking it to Franco's Nationalists. Both the deputy and Arturo become hunted men. Arturo seeks shelter in a local cabaret, where he again meets Soledad, who is revealed to be a prostitute.\nSoledad discovers that Arturo was a priest, but because she likes him, she tries unsuccessfully to hide him from the militiamen. Hawthorne, New York war correspondent and Soledad's friend, tries to free Arturo.\nArturo tells the Loyalist intelligence chief that he can make himself useful by comforting Catholic Loyalists who are wavering because of the treatment of the church.\nOut of jail, but under surveillance, Arturo meets Soledad and the priest who has hidden the holy relic. The absence of the relic is causing unrest in the town and unsettling the local Loyalist militia. The Loyalists are now suffering a great number of desertions because of the missing relic, which is fabled to provide victory to those who possess it. This makes it essential for the local Loyalists to secure it. But because of a well-meaning, disastrous attempt to feed the old priest in hiding, Soledad leads Loyalist security men to his hideout.\nDespite torture, the old priest refuses to divulge the relic's location, and he is to be shot at dawn. The security chief then has Arturo hear the condemned priest's confession. Learning of the relic's whereabouts, Arturo takes it, but claims not to know where it is. He is arrested and taken to see the torturing of Soledad, for whom he has declared his love.\nSoledad is spared by the arrival of the commanding general, an old man who disapproves of torture and dirty tricks. He orders all 250 prisoners to be marched to the battle lines. They will be given arms to slow the Nationalist advance on the city and cover the Loyalists' retreat. On the march, Arturo gives Soledad the relic so she that can try to take it to safety. However, in a surprise nighttime rebel attack, she is wounded. The prisoners change hands, but the Nationalist commander decides that he cannot trust them or leave them behind, and he orders that they be executed. Arturo pleads with the officer assigned to the task, but the man does not believe Arturo's story. Before the unfortunates have been shot, however, Soledad and the relic are found. She dies, but the prisoners are set free."

No amount of thoughtful writing or glib direction, however, can salvage the effort when the plot, after going farther than other films toward investigating a religious quandary in the Graham Greene manner, takes everything back at the end and dissolves into a mass of inspirational sentimentality.\"According to MGM records, the film earned $410,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $525,000 in other markets, resulting in a loss of $1,527,000, making it one of MGM's bigger box-office failures of the year."

James' 1992 novel The Children of Men, was credited to five writers, with Clive Owen making uncredited contributions. The film is set in 2027, when two decades of human infertility have left society on the brink of collapse. Asylum seekers seek sanctuary in the United Kingdom, where they are subjected to detention and refoulement by the government. Owen plays civil servant Theo Faron, who tries to help refugee Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) escape the chaos. Children of Men also stars Julianne Moore, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Pam Ferris, Charlie Hunnam, and Michael Caine.\nThe film was released by Universal Pictures on 22 September 2006, in the UK and on 25 December in the US. Despite the limited release and lack of any clear marketing strategy during awards season by the film's distributor, Children of Men received critical acclaim and was recognised for its achievements in screenwriting, cinematography, art direction, and innovative single-shot action sequences. It was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Film Editing. It was also nominated for three BAFTA Awards, winning Best Cinematography and Best Production Design, and for three Saturn Awards, winning Best Science Fiction Film.

The United Kingdom is one of the few remaining nations with a functioning government and has become a police state in which immigrants are arrested and either imprisoned or executed.\nTheo Faron, a former activist turned cynical bureaucrat, is kidnapped by the Fishes, a militant immigrant-rights group led by Theo's estranged wife, Julian Taylor; the pair separated after their son's death during a 2008 flu pandemic. Julian offers Theo money to acquire transit papers for a young refugee woman named Kee. Theo obtains the documents from his cousin, a government minister, and agrees to escort Kee in exchange for a larger sum of money. Luke, a Fishes leader, drives Theo, Kee, Julian, and former midwife Miriam towards Canterbury, but an armed gang ambushes them and kills Julian. Two police officers later stop their car; Luke kills them, and the group hides Julian's body before heading to a safe house.\nKee reveals to Theo that she is pregnant, making her the only known pregnant woman in the world. Julian had intended to take her to the Human Project, a scientific research group in the Azores dedicated to curing humanity's infertility, which Theo believes does not exist. Luke becomes the new leader of the Fishes. That night, Theo eavesdrops on a discussion and learns that the Fishes orchestrated Julian's death so that Luke could become their leader and that they intend to kill him and use Kee's baby as a political tool. Theo wakes Kee and Miriam, and they escape to the secluded hideaway of Theo's reclusive, aging hippie friend Jasper Palmer, a former political cartoonist whose wife was tortured into catatonia by the British government for her activism.\nThe group plans to reach the Human Project ship, the Tomorrow, scheduled to arrive offshore at Bexhill, a notorious immigrant detention centre. Jasper plans to use Syd, an immigration officer to whom Jasper sells cannabis, to smuggle them into Bexhill as refugees, from where they can take a rowing boat to rendezvous with the Tomorrow. The next day, the Fishes discover Jasper's house, forcing the group to flee. Jasper stays behind to stall them and is murdered by Luke as Theo watches. Theo, Kee, and Miriam meet with Syd, who helps them board a bus to the camp. When Kee begins experiencing contractions, Miriam distracts a guard by feigning religious mania and is taken away.\nInside the camp, Theo and Kee meet a Gypsy woman, Marichka, who provides a room where Kee gives birth to a baby girl. The next day, Syd tells Theo and Kee that war has broken out between the British military and the refugees and that the Fishes have infiltrated the camp; he then reveals that Theo and Kee have a bounty on their heads and attempt to capture them. Theo subdues Syd with Marichka's help; they escape but are ambushed by the Fishes, who capture Kee and the baby. Theo tracks them to an apartment building that is under heavy fire. Theo confronts Luke, who is killed in an explosion, and Theo escorts Kee and the baby out. Awed by the baby, the British soldiers and Fishes temporarily stop fighting and allow the trio to leave. Marichka leads them to the boat but stays behind as they depart.\nAs British fighter jets conduct airstrikes on Bexhill, Theo and Kee row to the rendezvous point in heavy fog. Theo reveals that he was shot and wounded by Luke earlier; he teaches Kee how to burp her baby, and she tells him she will name the baby girl Dylan, after Theo's and Julian's lost son. Theo smiles weakly, then loses consciousness as the Tomorrow approaches. As the screen cuts to black, children's laughter is heard."

James novel was originally written by Paul Chart, and later rewritten by Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby. The studio brought director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n on board in 2001. Cuar\u00f3n and screenwriter Timothy J. Sexton began rewriting the script after the director completed Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n. Afraid he would \"start second guessing things\", Cuar\u00f3n chose not to read P. D. James' novel, opting to have Sexton read the book while Cuar\u00f3n himself read an abridged version. Cuar\u00f3n did not immediately begin production, instead directing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. During this period, David Arata rewrote the screenplay and delivered the draft which secured Clive Owen and sent the film into pre-production. The director's work experience in the United Kingdom exposed him to the \"social dynamics of the British psyche\", giving him insight into the depiction of \"British reality\". Cuar\u00f3n used the film The Battle of Algiers as a model for social reconstruction in preparation for production, presenting the film to Clive Owen as an example of his vision for Children of Men. In order to create a philosophical and social framework for the film, the director read literature by Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, as well as similar works. The 1927 film Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans was also influential."

The film was produced by Sai Korrapati's Vaaraahi Chalana Chitram with an estimated budget of \u20b930\u201340 crore (US$6\u20137 million). It was filmed simultaneously in Tamil language with the title Naan Ee (transl.\u2009I, the Fly). The film stars Nani, Sudeepa, and Samantha. M. M. Keeravani composed the songs and the background score while K. K. Senthil Kumar was the director of photography. Janardhana Maharshi and Crazy Mohan wrote the dialogue for the Telugu and Tamil versions, respectively.\nThe film's narrative is in the form of a bedtime story told by a father to his daughter. Its protagonist Nani, who is in love with his neighbour Bindu, is murdered by a wealthy industrialist named Sudeep, who is attracted to Bindu and considers Nani a rival. Nani reincarnates as a housefly and tries to avenge his death and protect Bindu from an obsessive Sudeep.\nThe idea for the film originated in the mid-1990s from a conversation in which Rajamouli's father and screenwriter V. Vijayendra Prasad joked with Rajamouli about the idea of a fly seeking revenge against a human. Rajamouli reconsidered the idea after finishing Maryada Ramanna (2010), and developed it into a script. The film's production began on 7 December 2010 at Ramanaidu Studios in Hyderabad. Principal photography began on 22 February 2011 and continued until late February 2012. Makuta VFX and Annapurna Studios oversaw Eega's visual effects and digital intermediate process, respectively.\nThe two versions of the film, alongside a Malayalam-dubbed version titled Eecha, were released on 6 July 2012 in approximately 1,100 screens globally. The performances of the cast (particularly of Nani, Sudeep and Samantha), Rajamouli's direction, and visual effects received critical acclaim upon release. Eega was one of the highest-grossing Telugu films of the year, earning more than \u20b9125 crore ($23 million). Eega won two National Film Awards (Best Feature Film in Telugu and Best Special Effects), five South Filmfare Awards including Best Telugu Film, Best Telugu Director, Best Telugu Actress (Samantha) and Best Telugu Supporting Actor (Sudeep) and three South Indian International Movie Awards. The film won nine awards, including Most Original Film at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival. Eega was listed among \"The 25 Best Foreign Films of the Decade\" by The Ringer."

        "content": "A young girl who is unable to sleep asks her father to tell her a bedtime story. Although reluctant at first, he tells her a story of a fly named Nani.\nNani is a young man based in Hyderabad who specialises in preparing fireworks. He is in love with his neighbour Bindu, a micro artist who runs Project 511, a non-governmental organisation (NGO). Bindu also develops romantic feelings for Nani though she does not express them. Seeking to raise money for her NGO, Bindu visits the office of a rich and powerful industrialist named Sudeep, who also finds her attractive and starts lusting for her. He donates \u20b915 lakh (US$28,000), and befriends her. As days go on Sudeep's attempts to woo her fail miserably as she does not even notice his intentions. One day he sees Nani following Bindu on the street and realizes that they are attracted to one another. Sudeep sees Nani as a rival and plans to kill him. One night, Nani inspires Bindu to help her finish a piece of micro art\u2014a heart locket made from a pencil. While returning home, Sudeep kidnaps and strangles Nani to death, making his death look like an accident. Before dying, Nani curses Sudeep, swearing to kill Sudeep if he tries to hurt Bindu. Unaware of the incident, Bindu confesses her love for the dying Nani by phone; it is the last thing Nani hears before he is reincarnated as a housefly that cannot remember its previous life.\nThe fly's memory is triggered when it encounters Sudeep and Bindu and begins to devote itself to exacting revenge on Sudeep. Sudeep asks the heartbroken Bindu to accompany him to New Delhi to meet the education minister; if she can impress the minister with a presentation about the NGO, he might help it gain national recognition. The fly causes Sudeep to have a freak accident on his way to the airport and writes \"I will kill you\" on the windshield; this makes Sudeep paranoid. The fly, who sees Bindu mourning Nani's death in her bedroom, reveals itself to be Nani by writing on the desk with her tears. It conveys the circumstances of Nani's death to Bindu, and they join forces against Sudeep. The latter's obsession with the fly affects his professional and personal life. In a chain of events, his black money is burnt to ashes, leaving him almost penniless. Sudeep learns from a sorcerer named Tantra that Nani is reincarnated as a fly and seeks revenge. Sudeep arranges to kill Nani at his home, but the fly escapes after causing a short circuit and a fire, which locks up the room. Tantra is killed in an accident and Sudeep is left unconscious from the smoke. Nani and Bindu assume Sudeep is dead, but he is saved by his business partner Adithya. Sudeep is enraged when he learns that Bindu is helping the fly. Sudeep kills Adithya to collect a \u20b9700 crore (US$130 million) insurance policy, as well as to prevent his investors from taking action against his company.\nSudeep takes Bindu to his home to interrogate her, and Nani follows them. Bindu, after attempting to stab Sudeep with a razor blade, has her life threatened as Sudeep demands Nani to appear. During the encounter however, Nani seriously injures Sudeep with a needle. After an intensive fight, the latter clips Nani's wing before fatally stabbing him with the same needle. Knowing that he is dying, in a last-ditch attempt to destroy Sudeep, Nani coats himself with gunpowder and jumps through the flame of a burning match and into a cannon, which was loaded with a steel ball. The cannon fires and the projectile passes through Sudeep's chest and hits an oxygen cylinder, causing a fierce explosion in which Sudeep dies and his entire house burns down. A grieving Bindu (who hid from the inferno unscathed), pines for Nani and takes his wing and makes an amulet with it. One day when travelling to work, an eve teaser bothers her; Nani, again reborn as a Honeybee, attacks him with a needle before announcing his return.\nThe young girl is impressed with the story of the fly her father narrates. During the credits, her father recounts the fate of a drunken thief who broke into Bindu's house earlier in the story, and who ultimately turns his life around after overhearing a loving speech given to Nani by Bindu and mistakenly believing that Bindu was speaking to him."

        "content": "The film's main theme is revenge; the soul of a murdered man is reincarnated as a fly and seeks revenge against his killer. Rajamouli identified some similarities to David Cronenberg's The Fly (1986), in which a scientist becomes a fly when his experiment malfunctions, and thought of Eega as a \"socio-fantasy\" rather than a science fiction film. At a meeting with students at the Annapurna International School of Film and Media Campus (AIFSM), he compared the battle between the fly and Sudeepa, which the underdog fly wins, to David's triumph over Goliath and India's victory in the 1983 Cricket World Cup. Crazy Mohan compared the film with Apoorva Sagodharargal (1989), a revenge drama whose protagonist Appu (Kamal Haasan) is a dwarf.Mohan told Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu that although the film's script may resemble those of Stuart Little (1999) and Shrek (2001), the use of the plight of someone tormented by a housefly was an original idea. According to Tamil film historian and actor Mohan Raman, Naan Ee\u2014unlike the animal-centred films Nalla Neram (1972) and Neeya? (1979)\u2014lacks a human protagonist. Film critic Baradwaj Rangan found Eega's protagonist realistic, contrary to the ones in the animated films by the Walt Disney Company, except when it displays a few anthropomorphic traits. Mid-Day compared Eega to Cockroach (2010), an Australian short film about a man who is reincarnated as a cockroach after he is accidentally killed on his wedding day.The film's secondary theme is the survival of love beyond death. Rangan has likened Eega to a ghost film because a dead protagonist returns to his loved ones as a troubled soul. Malini Mannath of The New Indian Express found the scene where the fly foils Sudeepa's attempt to get close to Bindu reminiscent of one in the film Ghost (1990). Mayank Shekhar criticised the relationship between the lead pair, which he said advocates stalking as an accepted form of romance. Malathi Rangarajan said the antagonist took the \"extreme step\" of murdering the hero early in the film, in contrast with the stereotypical antagonist whose lust for the female lead has just begun and threatens the hero.Commenting on the usage of Tantrism, The New Indian Express' Kruthi Grover found the death of the sorcerer similar to the story of Bhasmasura, a demon in Indian mythology to whom Shiva gives the power to reduce a person to ashes by touching her or his head. When Bhasmasura tries to touch Shiva's head, Vishnu assumes the form of Mohini and makes Bhasmasura touch his own head, killing him. According to Malathi Rangarajan, the film's themes of Tantrism and black magic are reminiscent of the use of the occult as a plot device in films directed by B. Vittalacharya."

Keeravani said because the film's theme of revenge and the protagonist (a housefly) are universal concepts, his \"only challenge\" was ensuring the music did not have a \"distinct ethnic or regional flavour\" and \"appeal\". He incorporated the buzzing sound made by flies into the score and exaggerated or reduced it according to a scene's emotional nature. Rajamouli approached Madhan Karky to write the lyrics for Naan Ee's soundtrack after the release of Enthiran (2010), explaining the importance of each song in the film's narrative. As well as providing detailed profiles of the characters, Rajamouli enacted a few scenes, which helped Karky write the lyrics.Eega's soundtrack was released on 4 April 2012 at a promotional event at Shanti Sarovar, Brahma Kumaris' academy in Gachibowli, a suburb of Hyderabad. The soundtrack for Naan Ee was released on 2 May at another promotional event at Sathyam Cinema in Chennai. Eega's soundtrack release on iTunes was delayed until 7 April to avoid piracy and illegal downloads.Writing for The Hindu, Sangeetha Devi Dundoo called the soundtrack \"melodious ... sharply contrasted by the background score, which seamlessly moves from sober to playful to pulsating\". Another critic for The Hindu, S. R. Ashok Kumar praised Vijay Prakash's rendition of \"Konjam Konjam\". Kumar appreciated the use of violins in \"Eedaa Eedaa\" and called \"Lava Lava\" \"a good number\". Karthik Pasupulate of The Times of India wrote that Keeravani \"just seems to reserve his best for [Rajamouli]\", calling the soundtrack \"one of his finest\"."

His performance was appreciated by other celebrities such as Nagarjuna, Mahesh Babu, and Ram Gopal Varma; Varma said he recognised Sudeep's potential after watching Eega, adding, \"Many take his acting in that film for granted, with respect to his expressions when interacting with the fly, but as a director, I know how difficult it is to act when you are imagining the fly to be there\". Sudeepa's performance in Naan Ee impressed filmmaker Chimbu Deven, who cast him as the antagonist in Puli (2015).Speaking about the centenary of Indian cinema at the CII Media & Entertainment Summit 2012, filmmaker Shekhar Kapur said regional cinema is surpassing Hindi cinema in content and story, and cited Eega as an example. Kapur said he was impressed with its story and use of technology, and called it \"no less than a Hollywood superhero film\". Shah Rukh Khan called Eega an \"awesomely original\" film and a \"must watch\" with children. Lavanya Tripathi cited Nani's performance in Eega as one of the reasons she worked with him in Bhale Bhale Magadivoy (2015).Eega was parodied twice in Bhimaneni Srinivasa Rao's comedy film Sudigadu (2012); when a young girl asks her father to tell her a bedtime story in the opening credits, and in a scene in which the protagonist threatens to kill a female crime boss with weapons designed by Rajamouli, including the fly's needle.

Shobha Warrier of Reddif placed Sudeepa on her list of \"Top Tamil Actors of 2012\", writing that his performance was \"so superlative and far superior to any other actor's in Tamil\" that it \"has to be termed as the best performance of the year\". Radhika Rajamani ranked Rajamouli first on her \"Top Telugu Directors of 2012\" list, which was published in January 2013. In 2020, Sankeertana Verma of Film Companion included the film in her list of \"25 Greatest Telugu Films Of The Decade\".Adam Nayman of The Ringer listed Eega among \"The 25 Best Foreign Films of the Decade\".

In an April 2016 interview with The Hindu, Tamil actor Suriya said films like Sagara Sangamam (1983), Eega, Baahubali: The Beginning, and Manam (2014) are remembered much longer than more conventional films.In 2019, the film's plot was widely shared on social media in Spanish-speaking countries because of its unique plot that involved a fly taking revenge on a human."

Stanford and his family have provided the only real support that Alec has ever known.\nGraham ricochets between potential allies, foes and new leads in order to learn who the real murderer could be, with suspects including Stanford's beautiful wife Honor, his even younger secretary Vickie Harker and his adopted son who's Alec's best friend, Brian, who allows Graham to see what his own misspent life looked like through his son's eyes.\nWith the Home Office on standby to receive any evidence proving Alec's innocence, Graham is forced to extreme measures to try to establish the real killer's guilt.\nIn a private room, Graham is permitted a final meeting with his son, with Honor there. Alec passionately kisses Honor, adding a new dimension. The conversation also alludes to Alec's relationship with Jenny. Honor leaves to allow father and son a final embrace, and more confessions are made.\nGraham visits a pub with Stanford and gathers some more clues before getting very drunk.\nGoing to a theatre, he finds Stanford's alibi of spending the night with an actress was not actually true. He confronts Stanford at his race track where he is test-driving a Mercedes 300SL. Stanford explains that anyone can be bought and offers Graham shares in his company in exchange for silence. Still lacking evidence, he says that Stanford is threatening to kill him if he tells the truth. A struggle with a gun ensues and David deliberately has Stanford shoot him dead, saving Alec's life."

The handling of the interestingly varied cast is creditable: Michael Redgrave gives a sensitive and accomplished interpretation of the difficult role of the introspective alcoholic. Alec McCowen as the son and Leo McKern as the crazed motor-manufacturer both give stylish performances.

The only substantial source of income for the little hill town of Santa Vittoria is its wine. The townsfolk learn that the German occupation forces will be arriving soon, with plans to confiscate most of Santa Vittoria's wine and transport it to Germany. The people organize under the inspiration of their new mayor, Italo Bombolini (Anthony Quinn), who until days before had been thought of as a buffoon by everyone in town including his wife (Anna Magnani), and had only been appointed mayor by the town\u2019s pro-Mussolini politicians as a ruse to deflect the people\u2019s anger. With everyone working together, the villagers are able to hide a million bottles of wine by sealing them up in the galleries of an ancient Roman cave before the arrival of a German army detachment under the command of Sepp von Prum (Hardy Kr\u00fcger).\nThe Germans, when they arrive, confiscate most of the almost 320,000 bottles of wine the villagers had left for them to find. However, the Germans have accounting records that there is supposed to be five times as many bottles. Von Prum comes to suspect the rest is hidden in or near Santa Vittoria. He and Bombolini, two very different men, engage in a battle of wits in the days that follow. The Germans\u2019 search is made complicated when von Prum becomes infatuated with Caterina Malatesta (Virna Lisi), an educated and elegant woman unlike any other in town. She is secretly sheltering and has fallen in love with Tufa (Sergio Franchi), a wounded captain in the Royal Italian Army, who, as it happens, has provided much of the brainpower for the town\u2019s so far successful wine-hiding plans.\nVon Prum orders every building and home and the surrounding area searched. His men find no wine, but they discover Tufa hiding in Caterina\u2019s home. Later von Prum, who by now is absolutely certain the village is indeed hiding one million bottles of wine from him, orders several villagers to be tortured into revealing its location. However, the villagers cunningly arrange for the Germans to select the pro-Mussolini politicians to be tortured, who because they had been arrested shortly after Bombolini had become mayor, genuinely do not know anything about any hidden wine.\nFinally, with time running out before the Germans must withdraw north toward the Gustav Line, a frustrated von Prum threatens to shoot mayor Bombolini in front of the assembled townspeople unless the hidden wine's location is told. No one speaks up. Not being a Nazi fanatic, and perhaps also because he had been somewhat appeased by Caterina\u2019s having spent the previous night with him, which she did to save Tufa from being executed for desertion, von Prum silently accepts defeat and leaves the town without harming the mayor. After the Germans leave Santa Vittoria, the townspeople, led by Bombolini, celebrate their victory by dancing in the streets."

        "content": "After blacking out from an all-night drinking binge, dock worker Bobo (Jean Gabin) wakes up in a decrepit shack on a San Pablo Bay barge. The barge's owner, fisherman Takeo (Victor Sen Yung), reminds him how they met the previous night and that he agreed to work for Takeo. Bobo does not remember the encounter and intends to leave. A police boat passes, and hearing that the police are searching for the murderer of local bar-fly Pop Kelly (Arthur Aylesworth), who was strangled to death sometime during Bobo's drinking spree, causes Bobo to put the brakes on his plans to go. He is afraid he may have killed the man due to drunken violence he has been capable of in the past.\nHe takes the job on the barge, then goes into town to meet his friends Tiny (Thomas Mitchell) and Nutsy, the town watchman and amateur philosopher (Claude Rains), at a local boardinghouse. Despite Tiny's assurances that he didn't hurt anyone, Bobo worries. He agrees to meet Tiny later that night and leave town together. As he and Nutsy talk after Tiny leaves, Nutsy realizes Bobo is in possession of Pop Kelly's hat.\nAs the two men walk near the water, a female group begins to shout about a young woman who is about to drown herself in the surf. Bobo rescues her and takes her back to the barge. The next morning, the young woman, Anna (Ida Lupino), has rebounded and tidies up the shack while Bobo repairs the boat of Frank Brothers (Jerome Cowan), a wealthy doctor, and his mistress (Helene Reynolds). Anna makes breakfast for Bobo. Tiny shows up and begins badmouthing Anna (\"she used to work in a hash house\") and implying she is a prostitute. Tiny argues for Bobo to finally leave town with him as they had agreed. Anna overhears and tells Bobo she is \"much obliged for everything\" but she is \"blowing now\", planning to go back to her life and make her way.\nBobo appears to have fallen for Anna. After she is gone, Tiny hints broadly at what damage he might be able to do to Bobo, regarding his history of aggression. Bobo loses his temper and nearly strangles Tiny, but catches himself and tells him to get out and never come back.\nNutsy stops by that night and finds Bobo having decided to leave town alone. While they are chatting, Nutsy acting as a voice of reason and encouraging Bobo to accept that he may have reached a point where he wants a home, Anna returns. Unnoticed, Nutsy takes Pop Kelly's hat from the shack and later burns it on the beach. Anna and Bobo  obviously are drawn to each other, and she talks about her dream of settling down and creating a home, like the cozy barge across the bay. He grabs his bag and leaves, wishing her \"good luck\". In town, he tries to spend time with Mildred (Robin Raymond), a prostitute he met during his drunken melee, but he can't stop thinking about Anna and goes back to the barge.\nBobo and Anna decide to settle down and plan to get married. They buy paint and fabric to fix up the shack. After he heads out with Takeo to catch bait, Tiny again interferes and suggests to Anna that he and \"his buddy\" have a dark history together. Anna is disturbed by this conversation, and when Bobo comes back, she asks him about Tiny. He explains their relationship and tells her about his regrettable tendency to be violent, especially if he gets drunk.\nBobo and Anna get married on the barge with all their friends in attendance. Dr. Brothers sails by during the wedding and asks Bobo to again help him fix his boat. With Anna's blessing, Bobo agrees, and they set off. His happily married state encourages the doctor to leave his mistress and return to his wife. On the barge, Anna opens a gift from Bobo \u2014 a gaudy revealing dress, once owned by Mildred. Nutsy assures her that wives should leave modesty out of married life and Anna dons the dress, anticipating Bobo's return.\nAfter Nutsy leaves Anna, Tiny comes to the barge, drunk and angry that he wasn't invited to the wedding. Tiny and Anna argue, and she realizes that Tiny killed Pop Kelly. Enraged, Tiny attacks Anna. When Bobo returns, he and the doctor find Anna stuffed in the bait box, badly injured. They rush her to the hospital, and Dr. Brothers promises to do all he can for her. Leaving Nutsy to wait for word about his wife's condition, Bobo goes hunting for Tiny. He tracks a drunken Tiny to the breakwater near the barge. Bobo stalks him down to the water while Tiny professes his innocence the entire time. Tiny, who cannot swim, climbs onto the rocks to escape, but he is swept away by a wave.\nAfter some time has passed and Anna is able to leave the hospital, Bobo brings her back to the barge via the doctor's boat. She is unable to walk, but he is anxious to at last carry her, as per tradition, across the threshold of their home, which has been spruced up to be as cozy as Anna dreamed it would be. Their favorite song plays as they go inside."

The charismatic Gabin had been in a number of successful leading-man roles and had a hand in picking Robertson's story for adaptation to film. Willing to take a chance on him, Twentieth Century Fox bought the rights, despite the novel's themes of prostitution, rape, cannibalism and murder. The Motion Picture Production Code meant the studio had to drop most of the story. In the role of the nefarious Tiny, Mitchell was cast against type, having played Scarlet O'Hara's father in Gone with the Wind.\nSoon after shooting began, director Fritz Lang left the project, rumored to be due to friction he had with Gabin regarding Marlene Dietrich, who had been involved with both men. It's not known which early footage is shot by Lang or replacement director Archie Mayo. There were problems regarding the film's location on San Pablo Bay, which had to be scrapped after the attack on Pearl Harbor and the west coast was declared a security zone. A large studio set was filled with water for the barge scenes, giving the film an artificial, dream-like ambiance. The lighting, fog and wave effects, at times dingy and sinister or sparkling and romantic depending on the scene, led to Clarke's Oscar nomination for cinematography.\nSurrealist Salvador Dal\u00ed was hired to create the drunken montage at the top of the story but his sketches were deemed too bizarre, and the scene was shot with only some of his influence (most likely the close-up of the clock, the headless woman) intact."

Gabin was unhappy within the studio system and the pressure to do publicity, and after the war, he resumed working in France exclusively.Bosley Crowther, film critic for The New York Times, questioned the direction of the film, especially its focus on actor Jean Gabin: \"But all of them need much more than a vague and irresolute script, much more than synthetic scenery and manufactured moods. Director Archie Mayo hasn't brought them into contact with real life. He has expended most of his energy in bringing the audience into contact with Mr. Gabin. And Moontide is too heavy a burden to be carried entirely by him, even though he is Charles Boyer from the other side of the railroad tracks.\"In 2013, Dave Kehr (also of the Times) wrote that Moontide \"provides an illuminating link to one of the frequently overlooked sources of noir: the movement known as 'poetic realism', which flourished in France from the mid-1930s until the onslaught of war...a rootless, hard-drinking French sailor, Bobo (Gabin), achieves a tentative domesticity operating a bait shack with Anna (Ida Lupino), a waif he has rescued from a suicide attempt. The story is so much in the foggy, claustrophobic, doom-laden spirit of poetic realism that at times it seems almost a parody of it. Fate is present in the form of Tiny (Thomas Mitchell), a blackmailer with knowledge of a murder that Bobo might have committed. A kindlier metaphysical force is represented by Claude Rains, playing a waterfront philosopher with the unfortunate name Nutsy.\"When the DVD was released in 2008, critic David Mermelstein, writing for Variety, wrote \"A twisted romance set among waterfront lowlifes, the b&w pic resonated with neither critics nor auds, though as this DVD debut makes clear, there seems every reason to hope cineastes may now embrace it for what is always was: a keenly observed, highly atmospheric film distinguished by several superb performances and a captivating, if quotidian, mise-en-scene. Solid extras like a full commentary track and meaty 'making-of' featurette should only help raise its standing.\""

The conflict between two older men with different mindsets\u2014Ramadasu (an eternal, devious debtor) and Mukundarao (a generous, rich gentleman with fake prestige)\u2014is the film's centrepiece.\nProduction began after the success of Mayabazar (1957), with M. S. Chalapathi Rao and Jagannadham the film's executive producers. Marcus Bartley was the director of photography. S. Rajeswara Rao composed the soundtrack and background score. G. Kalyanasundaram and K. Radhakrishna edited the film, and Madhavapeddi Gokhale and Kaladhar were its art directors. The film is shown almost entirely in black and white, with the exception of a dance sequence filmed in Gevacolor.\nAppu Chesi Pappu Koodu was released on 14 January 1959, during the Makara Sankranti festival season. With average returns during its first four weeks, the film eventually became an above-average grosser and its re-release was profitable. It has cult status in Telugu cinema, and is an acclaimed Prasad film. Goldstone Technologies announced that they would attempt to digitise the film in 2007, but abandoned the attempt three years later."

        "content": "Ramadasu, a devious zamindar who recently acquired the colonial title of Rao Bahadur, is a perennial debtor who believes in leading a luxurious life on credit. His shrewd, schizophrenic manager Bhaja Govindam placates angry creditors with false promises. Dewan Bahadur Mukunda Rao, a wealthy, generous zamindar, is searching for a royal bridegroom for his granddaughter Manjari. Ramadasu plans to marry his son Raghu, a doctor practising in London, to Manjari to pay his debts. Unbeknownst to his father, though, Raghu has married a woman named Leela.\nRamadasu first bribes Rao's manager, Ramalingam. Rao, unaware of the deception, agrees to the alliance. Manjari, who knows the truth, wants to stop the marriage. Leela's brother Raja, is released from prison after serving a sentence for his participation in the Indian independence movement. Raja and Manjari were lovers during their college days, and she tells him about Ramadasu's intentions. After Raghu arrives from London, Ramadasu misleads him into thinking that Leela has died.\nWhen Raja asks Ramadasu to spare Leela, he sends his mobsters to attack him. Raja overpowers them, cornering Ramadasu later, and Leela stays in his home disguised as a mute maid. Govindam, fed up with Ramadasu, wants to expose his dishonesty to his creditors. Govindam's relationship with Ramalingam's daughter, Usha, is strained. Ramalingam's attempts to marry her off are thwarted by Govindam. To reunite Leela and Raghu, Raja disguises himself as Prince Bonkulamarri Raja and enters Rao's house aided by Govindam's schizophrenia. Rao is impressed with Raja and considers him a suitable bridegroom for Manjari, who is aware of and supports Raja's plans.\nRaghu recognises Leela and is affectionate to her, which bothers Ramadasu. Despite his opposition to his father's intentions, Raghu continues to flirt with Manjari and play the prospective bridegroom. Raja and Govindam use several disguises in an attempt to expose Ramadasu's greed. Raghu introduces a foreign woman to Ramadasu as his demanding wife, who forces his father to incur more debt until he is cornered by his creditors. Ramalingam's deception is exposed, and Ramadasu apologises for his misdeeds. Raghu and Leela reconcile; Raja marries Manjari, and Govindam marries Usha."

With mediocre earnings during its first four weeks, the film became an above-average grosser. Its re-release was profitable, and it became a Telugu cult film.According to M. L. Narasimham of The Hindu, Prasad's \"deft handling\" made the scenes \"flow smoothly\" despite the number of characters but the magic of Pelli Chesi Choodu (1952) and Missamma was missing from Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu. In their Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema, Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen wrote that the film \"stages the victory of nationalist-modern alliance over decadent feudalism\"; Ramaiah's scenes are its \"most remarkable sections\", giving a \"semblance of unity\" to a plot they found \"barely coherent\". K. Moti Gokulsing and Wimal Dissanayake wrote that Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu, Missamma, Gundamma Katha (1962) and Ramudu Bheemudu (1964) \"represented the scope comedy had in the 1950s and 60s.\"In September 2006, a postage stamp commemorating Prasad was issued in Hyderabad. M. L. Narasimham, in an article about the honour, listed Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu with Shavukaru (1950), Samsaram (1950), Pelli Chesi Choodu, Manohara, Missamma and others as acclaimed films by the director after the release of Mana Desam (1949) and his association with Vijaya Productions. Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu was one of the popular 1950s films featuring Ramana Reddy and Relangi Venkata Ramaiah, whom film historian Punnami Ravi Chandra termed the Laurel and Hardy of Telugu cinema at the time. Relangi Narasimha Rao's 2008 comedy film of the same name, starring Rajendra Prasad, was a commercial failure."

Kanaga is the younger daughter of a local goon Amirthalingam. Kanaga's elder sister Beeda Pandiamma is a rogue who creates ruckuses in the village often. Kanaga goes to Chennai for her studies but is kept under continuous monitoring by her sister's henchmen as Pandiamma and Amirthalingam find out about Kanaga's love affair. Azhagiri skillfully takes Kanaga away to his home. However, Kanaga is again taken away from Azhagiri's home by Amirthalingam. Priya is surprised to see Amirthalingam. Priya tells a flashback whereby they actually belong to Thambikottai and their father Shanmugam was a bus driver working under Amirthalingam who owned a transport service with several buses. However, all the buses were poorly maintained, and Amirthalingam bribes the officials to obtain the fitness certificates. Despite several attempts made by Shanmugam to convince Amirthalingam to properly repair the buses, he neglects. This infuriates Shanmugam, and he resigns as does not want to risk the life of passengers. Lakshmi is Shanmugam's wife. When Lakshmi travels in Amirthalingam's bus, the brake fails and the bus meets with an accident, and Lakshmi passes away. Amirthalingam's bus company is sealed by the government.

On homecoming night, Cameron's boyfriend comes upon them having sex in Coley's car, and ultimately outs them both. \nCameron's aunt Ruth is raising the girl and is a devout Christian. She sends Cameron to God's Promise, a gay conversion therapy center for teenagers, who are called \"disciples\" there. It is run by the strict Dr. Lydia Marsh and her brother Reverend Rick, who claims that his sister's methods cured him of his own homosexuality; two members of his church had \"rescued\" him from a gay bar. Cameron's roommate Erin is repressing her homosexuality and earnestly believes in the camp's program.\nCameron befriends two fellow \"disciples,\" Jane Fonda, who was raised in a hippie commune, and Adam Red Eagle, a Lakota two-spirit youth whose father has converted to Christianity and believes Adam should be 'cured'. The three teenagers bond over their mutual rebelliousness and skepticism of the camp's purpose.\nDuring a group session, Cameron says that she thinks Coley is \"perfect\". Dr. Marsh says that the girl's homosexuality comes from a misplaced urge to be like Coley. Cameron covertly phones Coley during a visit to a restaurant and apologizes for how things turned out. Coley says she sent Cameron a letter, but the call is interrupted. After disrupting a kitchen chore session, Cameron has her mail privileges unexpectedly granted by Dr. Marsh. \nShe reads Coley's letter, learning that Coley blames her for \"seducing\" her and that she outed Cameron. Jane reads the letter with Cameron and destroys it, calling Coley weak-willed and treacherous. Crying, Cameron calls her aunt Ruth and asks to be brought home. Ruth turns her down, saying she is doing this because she loves the girl.\nCameron tries to adapt better to the center routine, exercising with Erin to Christian work-out tapes. One night while Cameron is having a sexual dream, Erin wakes her up and both girls kiss. Erin puts her hand in Cameron's sheets and pants to make love to her. Cameron has an orgasm but Erin regrets it and asks Cameron not to tell anyone because she wants to change.\nMark, a disciple who had been expecting to return home shortly, is informed by letter that he must remain at the camp because his father still considers him effeminate. In a group session, Mark recites a passage from 2 Corinthians 12. He begins to break down, shouting, \"When I am weak, I am strong!\" until he is forcibly restrained by Dr. Marsh. That night, Cameron sees large quantities of blood in one of the bathrooms.\nThe next morning, Dr. Marsh and Reverend Rick call a meeting, saying that Mark was badly injured during the night and is stable in a hospital. They do not explain what happened. After two of the \"disciples\" disrupt the group meeting, the adults hold a series of one-to-one meetings instead. \nDuring their meeting, Rick tells Cameron that Mark mutilated his own genitals and nearly died before Adam found him. Cameron asks why the staff wasn't monitoring Mark more closely; she asks Rick if he and Dr. Marsh have any idea what they are doing. Rick does not answer and bursts into tears. A government inquiry is launched into Mark's self-mutilation, but the investigator is unwilling to accept Cameron's assertion that God's Promise is inherently emotionally abusive.\nDisillusioned, Cameron, Jane and Adam decide to run away from the camp under cover of an early morning hike. They walk to a nearby road and hitchhike away."

At that time Samson had promised \"a kingdom\" to Hilda, then a girl of twelve; now, Hilda who earnestly believes his word has come to collect her kingdom.\nAs Samson struggles with the destructive consequences of his pursuit of glory and his growing fear that he has lost his creative powers, the mysterious Hilda helps him gain a glimpse of his former self."

Doctors tell him that no medical cure exists for his condition, but suggest that returning to L.A. might allow him to run into people who know him and might help fill in the blanks.\nRice does so, and promptly runs into some folks who recognize him. However, they know him as  Eddie Riccardi, a dangerous gangster gone missing, whose past record generates mistrust both among the police and all those who formerly knew him. Worse, ruthless crime boss Vince Alexander (Sonny Tufts), who was betrayed by Eddie before leaving town, is now out for revenge."

But there is so much pointless brutality in it that one may seriously question whether the movie people are wise to go on with the making of such pictures. The human family may not be perfect, but why subject it to so-called entertainment that is only fit for savage beasts.\"  In the 2009 book 100 Film Noirs, Jim Hillier compares and contrasts the film to Somewhere in the Night.  Hillier says that The Crooked Way benefited from its low budget by forcing the filmmakers to be more creative, which makes it the better film."

However, the corrupt MP Nagabooshan wants to destroy the dam and build a new one to get millions from the construction contract. When a dedicated dam inspector refuses to report it as unfit, Nagabooshan kills the inspector. In his dying moments, the inspector manages to hide a pen drive with the inspection report within an abandoned temple and warns the village head, Karunakara, to open the temple. Karunakara firmly believes that only the descendant of Raja Lingeswaran, the noble builder of the dam, can open the temple. Thus, he sets out on a mission to find the descendant. Lakshmi, Karunakara's granddaughter and a journalist, takes up the responsibility to locate the descendant. \nLakshmi's search leads her to Lingaa, a witty and cunning thief; he hates his grandfather for leaving his family penniless. Lingaa initially refuses to get involved, but he's trapped by Lakshmi to accompany her to Solaiyur. To his surprise, the villagers welcome Lingaa with great joy and celebration. Karunakara reveals a secret about the temple's lingam \u2013 it is made of an extremely valuable emerald stone. Tempted by the wealth it holds, Lingaa hatches a plan to steal it. However, his scheme is thwarted when he is caught by a diligent security guard. In a stroke of quick thinking, Lingaa pretends to perform a religious ritual to deceive the villagers. \nKarunakara reveals the true history of Raja Lingeswaran, who valiantly fought against the British to build the dam for the benefit of Solaiyur. Due to the British greed, Lingeswaran was falsely accused after completing the dam and banished from the village. When the villagers found out the truth, they tried to bring Lingeswaran home, but he refused, saying he was satisfied that his work on the dam would last forever. Karunakara's father vowed that until Lingeswaran returned to the village, the temple Lingeswaran built would be closed; Karunakara kept the promise. \nKnowing the truth about his grandfather, Lingaa decides to mend his ways, and agrees to help Karunakara save the dam. Nagabooshan tries to carry out his plan by bribing another inspector, but Lingaa, Karunakara, and Lakshmi stand in the way. Lingaa reveals the pen drive the previous inspector hid in the temple, having found it when he broke in. Nagabooshan tries to erase the file, but Lingaa's cohorts have already published it online to ensure the report doesn't disappear. Lingaa also reveals Nagabooshan's plans, having suspected him and had Lakshmi get proof; Nagabooshan is exposed, causing his downfall.\nNow desperate, Nagabooshan kidnaps Lakshmi and takes off in a hot air balloon rigged with a bomb to destroy the dam. Lingaa manages to get on the balloon and kick Nagabooshan out, killing him. He also kicks the bomb into the reservoir, saving the dam from destruction. Lingaa prepares to leave the village, wanting to become respectable like his grandfather. However, the police catch up with him, intending to arrest him for his past crimes.

Michael Sullivan, Sr. was orphaned and then raised by Irish Mob boss John Rooney in Rock Island, Illinois; unbeknownst to his own children, he is now Rooney's most fearsome enforcer. Rooney has come to love Sullivan more than he loves his own biological son, the rash and unpredictable Connor.\nSpeaking at his brother's wake, Rooney associate Finn McGovern insinuates that Rooney is responsible for his brother's death. Rooney sends Connor and Sullivan to talk with McGovern. Sullivan's older son, twelve-year-old Michael Jr., watches the interaction through a hole in the wall after having hidden in the back of the family car. McGovern denies that his brother stole anything from the mob and implies that Connor was responsible for the theft. Connor shoots McGovern, forcing Sullivan to shoot the other armed witnesses in self-defense. Sullivan learns that Michael saw the shootout and swears him to secrecy.\nRooney sends Sullivan to collect a debt from Tony Calvino. Connor, jealous and afraid, sends a letter with Sullivan for Calvino. Calvino reads the letter and reaches for his revolver, but Sullivan kills both Calvino and his bodyguard. The letter reads, \"Kill Sullivan and all debts are paid\". Sullivan rushes home. When he arrives, he discovers that Connor has already murdered his wife, Annie, and their younger son, Peter. Michael was unharmed, as he had arrived home late from detention.\nSullivan and Michael flee Rock Island and head to Chicago to meet mobster Frank Nitti. Sullivan offers to work for the Chicago Outfit in exchange for permission to kill Connor. Nitti rejects his offer and advises Sullivan against seeking revenge. Rooney, listening next door with Connor, reluctantly allows Nitti to dispatch freelance killer Harlen Maguire (who doubles as a crime scene photographer) to kill Sullivan. Maguire tracks the Sullivans to a roadside diner. Maguire and Sullivan have a seemingly casual conversation while Michael stays in the car. Sensing the danger, Sullivan escapes the diner through the bathroom window and slashes Maguire's tires before driving away.\nSullivan begins robbing the banks that hold the Outfit's money; in so doing, he hopes to pressure the Outfit into withdrawing their protection from Connor. Sullivan teaches Michael to drive so that he can act as a getaway driver. The mob withdraws money from its banks, frustrating Sullivan's plan. He visits Rooney's accountant, Alexander Rance. Rance stalls Sullivan until Maguire enters with a shotgun. Rance is killed in the crossfire before Sullivan wounds Maguire and escapes with Rooney's ledgers. During the escape, Maguire shoots Sullivan in the shoulder. Michael drives them to a farm after Sullivan collapses from his wound, and an elderly childless husband and wife at the farm help him recover. \nThe ledgers reveal that Connor has been embezzling from his father. Believing that Rooney will call off the hit on him if he knows the truth, Sullivan heads back to Chicago. Sullivan confronts Rooney at Mass and finds Rooney already knows that Connor has been robbing him. Rooney states that he expects that Connor will either be killed by Sullivan or be killed by Nitti's men after Rooney has died. Nevertheless, Rooney refuses to give up his son. He urges Sullivan to flee with Michael and raise him to be a better man than either of them are. Sullivan later ambushes and kills Rooney's bodyguards and then Rooney himself. Nitti reveals Connor's location after Sullivan promises that the feud will end with Connor's death. Sullivan goes to the hotel where Connor is hiding and kills him.\nSullivan takes Michael to his aunt's beach house in Perdition. Once there, he is ambushed and shot by Maguire inside the house as Michael stands on the beach. Michael appears and points a gun at Maguire, and Sullivan fatally shoots Maguire in the back. Michael tells his father that he could not pull the trigger, and Sullivan nods and smiles as he dies in his son's arms.\nMichael drives the car back to the elderly couple's farm. In a voiceover, he says that he grew up there. He adds that he has not held a gun since his father's death. Michael states that when he is asked if his father was a good man, he simply answers, \"He was my father\"."

Vasudevan Nair completed the screenplay of Panchagni, Hariharan decided to produce the film himself under his company Gayathri Cinema. During the pre-production of the film, G. P. Vijayakumar telephoned Hariharan and informed his wish to produce a Hariharan-M.T. Vasudevan Nair film under his newly formed production company, Seven Arts. Hariharan agreed and handed over the production to Vijayakumar. Initially, Naseeruddin Shah was cast in the role of news reporter Rasheed, per the suggestion of Nair. Shah signed the film and was given advance payment. Later, Mohanlal met Hariharan informing him of his wish to act in their film, but the casting process was already over by then. But after that meeting, Hariharan changed his mind and thought of casting him in the role of Rasheed. He talked the matter with Nair, and Mohanlal was fixed. In a later interview in 2000, Hariharan recalled: \"When we asked Mohanlal whether he would do the film, he said he would do 'any role'. The first thing I wanted was to give him a different appearance. Till then, he hadn't appeared without a moustache. So I asked him to shave it off. He immediately agreed. Panchagni went on to become a turning point in his career\". Initially, Ambika was chosen for the role of Indira, but she could not sign the film due to scheduling conflicts with a Kannada film, which she later regretted. Geetha was finalised for the role. Ambika said in a later interview in 2017 that Panchagni and Chithram are the two films in her career that she feels sad that she could not join."

Mary, a modernised Christian girl studying in a nearby town, returns to the village after finishing her examinations, where her wealthy brother David lives with his wife Elissy. David is ruthless, arrogant and feared by the villagers. However, he is extremely protective of his sister. Once when she sings with her friends, Vichu and his friends mock her singing skills. Feeling insulted, she decides to learn singing, obtains permission from David and enrolls in music classes under Vichu's mother.\nMary soon excels and gets the appreciation of Vichu's mother. Vichu gets impressed with Mary's perseverance and when she sings a song exceedingly well, he loses his heart to her. He starts chasing her and expresses his love. Mary, however, avoids him and goes to the extent of slapping him. But the same anger turns into love when she realises his true love for her.\nThe relationship between Vichu and Mary grows and they become very close to each other without their families knowing. Two children playing on the beach see Vichu and Mary romancing; one of them informs her mother, who in turn informs Elissy about their affair. Elissy berates Mary for courting a non-Christian and warns her of the consequences, should David learn. Elissy prevents Mary from leaving her house, instead arranging for Vichu's mother to teach her there. Vichu and Mary start exchanging messages written on paper pieces tucked in the harmonium. Despite Elissy's control, Mary manages to meet Vichu. Vichu's mother accidentally sees a note in the harmonium and cautions Vichu. However, he explains his true love and seeks her support.\nMary gets admission in a city college, but her love for Vichu prompts her to adopt ingenious techniques to fall ill to enable her to get excuses to cancel the trip. Vichu's friends say the best way to resolve the matter is by proposing formally. Vichu and his friends visit David at his house and propose Vichu's marriage with Mary; David angrily refuses, beats Mary and berates Elissy for being irresponsible. He then locks up Mary and vows to stop her love affair with Vichu.\nDuring the course of events, David gets aroused by his servant Mari's wife undressing, enters the bathroom and rapes her. Elissy who sees the whole thing is too afraid to stop David and she frantically tries to divert Mari's attention to avoid exposing David and thereby shaming her family. Though he is caught in the act, David cleanly gets away due to his clout, and Mari and his wife quietly leave the house without making a scene, after making a sarcastic comment to David that he had already 'repaid' them for their loyalty, and Elissy \u2014 rather than they \u2014 should be given the final payment for coolie services rendered, for standing 'guard' so faithfully during the shameful act.\nHurt by the barbed comment but knowing she did wrong and enraged at David's lack of remorse and callousness when she confronted him about the rape, Elissy now turns against David. She decides to help Mary, who truly loves Vichu and assists Mary to meet Vichu secretly. David, who comes to know of this, decides to get Mary married to a relative in a hurry. The priest at the local church meets David and advises him to understand true love and support the young lovers, but David disagrees as he feels religion is more important than emotions. Elissy is against his plan, and advises Mary to meet Vichu and decide their future.\nMary and Vichu decide not to run away, but to live in the same village. When they are together, David lands up, beats Vichu and his friends, takes Mary away and speeds up the process of her forced marriage. When Mary is determined to marry Vichu, Elissy takes her to Vichu's house and hands her over to his mother. Though Vichu's mother is apprehensive, she does not wish to abort their love and accepts Mary. However, David and his people arrive; Vichu's mother asks him and Mary to run away to a safer place. They both run away but remain at the beach. The night passes with protection from their friends. David meets the villagers and provokes them for allowing a Hindu to elope with a Christian. All the villagers join him and come to attack the lovers the next morning.\nVichu and Mary notice the armed crowds coming and decide to face them. An armed David comes to attack Vichu, but is stopped by the priest who advises David to be a human and respect love. David insists that as a true Christian he will not allow Mary to marry a non-Christian as long as she is Christian. In response, Vichu and Mary renounce their respective religions, much to the shock of David and the villagers, then walk away. Vichu's friends celebrate the lovers' new found happiness and peace."

The entire family goes to Bangalore to attend the marriage of Savitri (Richa Pallod) in Bangalore, and when the groom disappears, Arivu offers to take his place.

In a shop trying on a dress to wear to a wedding next day, she sees the man spying on her. When she goes home, he sneaks into the house, ties her up and rapes her. Realising after she has freed herself that he is still in the house, she gets out a shotgun and kills him. Then she drives the body to a cliff and tips it into the sea, saying nothing to her jealous husband when he returns.\nNext day at the wedding an uninvited American called Dobbs speaks to her. A body has been found and he claims she killed him, which she denies. The day after that, when her husband is away again, Dobbs sneaks into their house and questions Mellie roughly. She begins to think that the rapist had business with Toni, possibly drug related, and that is why Dobbs is so persistent. She goes with him to the bank and, drawing out all she has, offers it to him. But he doesn't want money, just the truth.\nThe next morning, Mellie stumbles upon the rapist's travel bag, which contains a staggering sum of 60,000 US dollars. Curious and determined, she stealthily enters Dobbs' hotel room to search for clues. To her astonishment, she uncovers evidence that Dobbs is not just an ordinary individual but a US Army colonel involved in a covert mission.\nIn a dramatic turn of events, Dobbs unexpectedly appears and reveals that a woman employed at a Parisian restaurant has been apprehended for the murder. Overwhelmed by the injustice of an innocent woman facing charges, Mellie impulsively boards a plane to Paris, determined to uncover the truth. She heads to the restaurant, but instead, she is redirected to the workplace of the arrested woman's sister\u2014an unexpected location: a brothel.\nWithin the confines of the brothel, Mellie finds herself subjected to intense interrogation by three criminals who are desperate for information about the deceased man. Just as the situation reaches a dangerous peak, Dobbs, who has been covertly following Mellie's trail, forcefully intervenes and rescues her from harm's way.\nTaking her home, Dobbs reveals that the corpse is not that of the rapist but another man's. The rapist was an escapee from a US military prison who had attacked three women in similar fashion before Mellie. She then tells him where she tipped the body, which is found by police frogmen. For Dobbs the case is closed and he does not tell the police about Mellie. Nor does he mention the 60,000 dollars.\nIn a closing homage to Alfred Hitchcock, it is revealed that the rapist's name was Mac Guffin."

All of their efforts are ultimately unsuccessful, with the result that all five of the women give birth the following year.\nThe story revolves around a wealthy London banker named Gerald Hardcastle (Niven) and his wife Prudence (Kerr), who live together unhappily, sleeping in separate bedrooms and speaking to each other only when necessary. The five couples in the film are (1) Gerald and his French mistress Elizabeth, or \"Liz\" (Demick), (2) Prudence and her doctor, Dr. Alan Huart (Michell), (3) the Hardcastles' maid Rose (Turner) and their chauffeur Ted (Armstrong), (4) Gerald's brother Henry (Coote) and his wife Grace (Redman), and (5) Henry and Grace's daughter Geraldine (Geeson) and her beau Tony Bates (Dundas).\nAll of the couples want to use a birth control pill called \"Thenol\", but none of them wants to admit it. Prudence, Grace, and Ted manage to acquire supplies of pills, Grace through a prescription written by Huart, and Ted from the\nlocal chemist, or pharmacist, who happens to be a friend of his. However, Grace soon becomes pregnant, because Geraldine has been stealing her pills and replacing them with aspirin tablets. After Geraldine admits her pill-switching scheme to Grace and Grace tells Gerald about it, Gerald uses the scheme on Prudence to generate incriminating evidence of her affair.\nMeanwhile, believing that Rose is too conservative to accept contraception, Ted puts his tablets in a vitamin bottle and tells her she needs them for her health. However, Rose is worried about becoming pregnant, so she switches the pills in her vitamin bottle with the pills in Prudence's Thenol bottle, just moments after Gerald replaces Prudence's Thenol with aspirin. The result, then, is that Rose unwittingly trades Ted's Thenol for Gerald's aspirin. She soon becomes pregnant, and Ted tells Gerald about the pills he gave her, but says nothing about telling her they were vitamins. When Gerald asks her why her Thenol pills failed to work, she asks him how he knew about them, thinking that he has already found out about her taking Prudence's pills, at which point they both realise that she has revealed her guilt.\nNow knowing why Prudence is still not pregnant, Gerald buys more aspirin, determined to expose her relationship with Huart. This eventually works, as do whatever measures Grace took to keep her pills away from Geraldine. By the end of the film, Geraldine and Prudence are both expecting.\nEventually, Gerald gets into trouble with both Liz and Prudence. Liz grows dissatisfied in her covert relationship with Gerald, who has been hiding her from his family, and decides to leave him. Prudence finds the letter that Liz wrote to Gerald about her decision, and Gerald finds Huart's Thenol prescription for Prudence. At first, neither Gerald nor Prudence is willing to grant the other a divorce, but Prudence offers to take the blame after becoming pregnant, as long as Gerald will spare Huart's reputation. Gerald accepts this arrangement grudgingly, but before meeting with Huart, he happens to see Liz while driving through town, and she tells him she is going to have his baby. Now able to see her openly, and with a child on the way, Gerald quickly and enthusiastically agrees to an amicable divorce. A few months later, a total of six newborn babies arrive, Rose having had twins."

Moments later, the Blackwater gang \u2013 Baptiste, Darko, Ramos, Snake, and Washington \u2013 arrive led by Red's half-brother Guerrero de la Cruz. After slaughtering everyone and freeing Red, they retreat. The next morning, Red tells them about Edendale, Colorado, where gold ore is being stored in a bank until a mineral dispute can be settled. Guerrero agrees to steal it, so long as they avoid unnecessary deaths. After the seven rob the bank, Red betrays Guerrero, as he had acquired the deed to the mine and wants to take over the town. He shoots Guerrero, and despite Guerrero's orders, Red convinces the rest of the gang to turn on him; they all shoot Guerrero to death.\nFinding himself in Hell, Guerrero meets Lucifer, whom he had seen recently in his dreams. Guerrero bargains with him, to allow him to return to Earth and to kill his former gang, so that the fires of Hell can grow hotter than he alone can stoke with his flesh. Intrigued by this, Lucifer grants Guerrero 24 hours to slay all six of his betrayers or his soul will remain damned to Hell; Satan tells him that only Guerrero can kill the six, dissuading him from asking for help. Guerrero wakens one year to the day of his death and makes his way back to town now called \"Tombstone\" in his memory.\nRamos, shaken by an omen earlier, returns to his home and witnesses two of his farmhands killed before confronting Guerrero, whom he could not immediately recognize. After Guerrero puts together his guns, a feat only  Red and he could accomplish, Ramos recognizes him, and he is shot to death. Taking his clothes, Guerrero has the local pastor set up six pine boxes as coffins and stations Ramos in one of them. The following morning, Baptiste and Darko discover Ramos and invade a nearby slaughterhouse. After a stand-off with Baptiste and his men, Guerrero kills Baptiste, but realizes that he still bleeds like a mortal. Darko tells Red about the stranger killing them off, and he sends Washington to the mine to insure that the man protecting them from the law is paid off in full. The gang goes to the saloon, where Guerrero is, and a firefight ensues. After defeating them, Guerrero sees the former sheriff's widow, Calathea, about to kill Red, and stops her, but he is trampled by Red's horse as he flees town. Waking sometime later, he explains to Father Paul and her about his situation. Showing him Darko's dead body, whom he had killed during the saloon brawl, Calathea agrees to help him, and the two make their way to the mine.\nIn the mine,  Judah Clark, a marshal, is revealed to be aiding Red and protecting him for access to the gold. They leave Washington and Snake to finish off Guerrero, but he turns the tables and kills Washington, as Calathea and he escape back to town with his body. After an intense chase, they return to town. In a stand-off, Guerrero kills Snake with a gunshot to the eye, but he is quickly shot down and Calathea is captured. Lucifer, still intrigued by Guerrero's tenacity, returns him to life with one hour remaining on his deadline. After a mob tries to kill Red, he takes Calathea captive and confronts his brother, who convinces him to a fair duel. Lucifer cheats with seconds remaining on the clock, and Red and Guerrero instead battle by hand. Guerrero gains the upper hand and kills Red, but two minutes after his time is up.\nEntering the church, Lucifer informs Guerrero of his failure, but does not want to condemn him to Hell. Instead, he forces Guerrero to kill outlaws to pay off his debt. Now, with Edendale out of danger, Guerrero rides off into the countryside, looking for his next bounty to collect for Hell."

He is known to come help people who are beyond any hope of assistance, and this leads to him being known as \"Dharmatma\". But Seth Dharamdas does have a number of skeletons in his closet and a parallel life as a gangster and a Matka king. The only person whom he dislikes and fears is his own son Ranbir.\nAfter a heated argument over Dharmatma's matka business, Ranbir leaves home for Afghanistan, where he stays with his uncle and manages his business. One day in a forest, while riding a horse, he finds a nomad, Jankura, and a woman, Reshma, fighting. He defends Reshma and they fall in love.\nMeanwhile, in India, his sister Mona, is all set to marry Kundan, the son of their father's old friend. She writes to Ranbir to attend her wedding and give them his blessings. Ranbir accepts her invitation and arrives at the venue. The marriage commences, and Mona departs after the ceremony. While in the car, she gives her husband a steel ring with \"I Love You\" inscribed on it.\nRanbir leaves for Afghanistan. He proposes to Reshma, which she accepts. Her foster-father also reluctantly agrees to their marriage. A fortune-teller there predicts that Reshma will bring death to Ranbir, which has Reshma worried.\nMeanwhile, in India, a business-rival by the name of Anokhelal proposes a narcotics deal to Dharmatma, which he refuses. His son-in-law tries to force him to accept the scheme but is unsuccessful. Dharmatma recognises the nature of his son-in-law and apologises for his mistake of letting his daughter marry him. He misses Ranbir and orders his assistant, Vikram Singh, to bring Ranbir back from Afghanistan. Vikram Singh agrees, but on the way, he is kidnapped by Anokhelal's sons, Natwar and Rishi and his brother Biradar.\nIn Afghanistan, Ranbir and Reshma prepare for their marriage. On the day of the wedding, they leave for the temple. While in the temple, Natwar and Rishi plant a bomb in their jeep, which will explode once the car is started. After praying, Reshma starts the jeep, and it explodes, killing Reshma leaving Ranbir heart-broken.\nNatwar and Rishi attack a Matka centre of Dharmatma, injuring him and Kundan. They order a nurse to help Kundan kill Dharmatma. In Afghanistan, Ranbir gets the news of the attack on his father and returns to India. Kundan kills Dharmatma, assisted by the nurse but loses his ring given to him by his wife. Ranbir arrives and finds that his father is dead. He promises to his father that he will find out his murderer and punish him. Some days later, Ranbir with Anu, a childhood friend who secretly loves him, goes out for a drive, where he is attacked by goons sent by Anokhelal. The doctor who operated on his father gives him the ring which he found in Dharmatma's hand and tells him that his father died from suffocation. Ranbir suspects a hospital employee to be a part of the conspiracy and asks the doctor about the nurse on duty that night. He visits her house only to find her killed by Natwar and Rishi. He tries the ring on her hand, but it doesn't fit.\nKundan arrives and lies to him that Vikram Singh is the killer and asks Ranbir to kill Vikram Singh.\nMeanwhile, at Anokhelal's place, they raise a toast for dead Dharmatma. Ranbir arrives there. Kundan, Natwar, and Rishi hide upstairs and position a sniper to kill Ranbir. Downstairs, Ranbir accepts the drug deal, which his father declined and provides them with \u20b9 5 million but on a condition that they will give him Vikram Singh, dead or alive, to which Anokhelal agrees. Anokhelal signals Natwar to stop Kundan from firing at Ranbir, which makes Kundan very angry. He returns home, drunk with a prostitute which makes Mona furious. Drunk and angry, Kundan beats Mona. This infuriates Ranbir. He arrives at their place and beats Kundan, but Mona stops him pleading him not to make her a widow. Kidnapped Vikram Singh is killed by Anokhelal.\nThen they take his dead body in a coffin and meet Ranbir in a church burying ground. Ranbir tries the ring on Vikram Singh, but it doesn't fit. Then Anokhelal laughs at him and confessing that he got his father killed. The police prevent goons from killing Ranbir, killing Anokhelal and his brother Biradar, but Ranbir is injured, too. He thanks the police for saving his life and departs.\nAt his place, while bandaging his wounds, Anu asks him to leave this place and travel to a safer place, to which he disagrees. After which, Mona arrives, tying rakhi to Ranbir's wrist. She sees the steel ring in Ranbir's hands and saying that she has given one to Kundan, but he has lost it. Ranbir realises that Kundan is the main culprit in the death of his father. He wants to kill him but is in a fix because he does not want to make his sister a widow.\nMona and Kundan return home, where they find Natwar and Rishi already present. Kundan signals Mona to go upstairs. Natwar and Rishi blackmail Kundan that they will expose that he was the main culprit behind his father-in-law's death. They demand him to find a path for Ranbir's death. Mona hears this conversation and informs about this to Ranbir. Kundan sees her doing all this.\nRanbir and Shakti Singh (Dara Singh), a top henchman of his father, arrive at their place and find Mona dead. A mourning Ranbir receives a call from Kundan asking Ranbir to meet him at his hideout in Madh Island. Meanwhile, he plans to kill him and Shakti Singh.\nRanbir accepts and arrives, only to find a bunch of goons with machine guns there to kill him and Shakti Singh.\nKundan lands in a helicopter in a hilly place with a small cottage where Natwar and Rishi are present. They ask him about their safe house, to which he says that a ship in the sea waiting for their arrival, and then he asks them about the narcotics. They reply that it is in the cottage. He asks its worth, to which they reply that it is full 5 million. Then he kills them and takes the carton of drugs from the cottage back to the helicopter, where he finds Ranbir. He is astonished to see him alive and confesses to him about the plan according to which he killed his father. Then he is forced to commit suicide by Ranbir by jumping off from the hill.\nAfter that, Ranbir closes all Matka's rackets across the world, which were led by his father, and hands over all the black money earned by his father to the police. He leaves with his mother and Anu, now his wife, to Afghanistan to continue his old work there."

A slum dweller finds the baby, takes him home, names him Surya and raises him. The child  grows up to be intolerant of injustice, especially to the poor, and wonders why his biological mother abandoned him. The only item from his mother is the yellow shawl in which she had placed him. Devaraj, a powerful gangster, who is kind but feared by most, fights injustice with violence. Surya attacks and kills Ramana, an auxiliary of Devaraj. Surya is arrested for murder and faces brutal torture from police, but Devaraj bails him out after perceiving Ramana's felony and realises Surya's cause was genuine. Surya and Devaraj, who share an ideology, come to understand each other. Devaraj declares Surya as his Thalapathi (commander) and best friend.\nArjun, the city's new district collector, wants to lawfully end violence. He is the second son of Kalyani, who is now a social worker. After abandoning Surya, her firstborn, she married Krishnamoorthy. Kalyani never told Arjun of the ordeal she faced as a teenager but is constantly grieved by thoughts of her long-lost firstborn. Meanwhile, Surya is courted by a Brahmin girl Subbulaxmi, who is smitten with his transparent nature. Surya's appraisal to Devaraj leads local people in the locality to respect them both. They continue objecting to societal incongruities. While Devaraj leads Surya to help curb unlawful discrepancies, Subbulaxmi despises Surya's use of violence and tries to persuade him against it. Devaraj tries to form a relationship between Subbulaxmi and Surya but Subbulaxmi's orthodox father objects and arranges her marriage to Arjun.\nIn his fight against organised crime, Arjun unsuccessfully targets Devaraj and Surya. Meanwhile, Padma, Ramana's widow, makes Surya feel guilty for killing Ramana. Understanding Padma's pain, Devaraj shelters her and her child. However, Padma confesses she is constantly troubled by the dishonourable men surrounding her. Devaraj, considering Padma and her daughter's safety and Surya's future, asks them to marry each other. Guilt-ridden, Surya marries Padma and eventually wins her child's affection. Later, at a medical camp, Kalyani meets Padma and her daughter, along with the shawl in which she wrapped Surya. After asking about the day he was found, Kalyani and Krishnamoorthy discover Surya is Kalyani's long-lost son during a suspect identification.  Krishnamoorthy secretly meets Surya and reveals the truth of his origin to him. Surya asks  Krishnamoorthy to promise not to let his mother know of Surya's identity because it would hurt her to know her son has grown to be a vigilante.\nKalyani eventually finds Surya and meets him. Surya vows not to harm Arjun for her sake. The long-standing feud between Devaraj and his main rival Kalivardhan makes Surya tell Devaraj, who learns of his meeting with his stepfather and mother  the truth about his family. Devaraj is pleased to know that, despite Arjun being Surya's half-brother, Surya still sides with him, thus valuing their friendship over family. Because of this, Devaraj decides to surrender. Devaraj and Surya meet Arjun, who now knows Surya is his own half-brother. Suddenly, Kalivardhan's henchmen open fire and Devaraj is killed. Enraged, Surya storms into Kalivardhan's house, murders Kalivardhan and all of his henchmen, and surrenders to the police, but is exonerated due to lack of evidence. Arjun is later transferred to another state with Subbulaxmi while Kalyani stays with Surya."

The character Subbulaxmi is based on Draupadi, Arjun on Arjuna and Kalyani on Kunti. The film was not originally publicised as an adaptation of the Mahabharata; Ratnam said this was because the \"parallels are hidden sufficiently inside the story to make it work. That is the way I wanted it \u2013 at a layer below and not crying out loud\". Venkateswaran said the film \"questions people's normally held ideas of friendship\". According to New Straits Times, the film does not extol crime or violence; rather it narrates the story of a tragic character who rises from slums to gain untold riches and unbridled power.Ratnam refused to name Surya's father, saying the film \"consciously avoids the who and the how of the underage girl's first love. It was the child, the son of Surya, who formed the story\". The name Surya was chosen to emphasise the character's connection to the sun, similar to the way Karna is the son of the sun god Surya in the Mahabharata. Ratnam did not consider killing Surya, unlike the Mahabharata in which Karna dies, because he felt the character had suffered enough, and \"his death would look too doomed, too tragic\"."

Subbaraj's 2014 film Jigarthanda includes several references to  Thalapathi. Rajinikanth's daughter, director Soundarya, said; \"I remember Thalapathy most vividly as that was the first time I went for a first-day-first-show ever\". Mammootty's performance in the scene in which Devaraj tells Arjun \"mudiyathu\" (transl.\u2009not possible) after being asked to surrender everything inspired director Mahi V Raghav to cast him in Yatra (2019).Thamizh Padam (2010) parodied Thalapathi by featuring scenes with characters who are dimly lit and speak one-word dialogues. Atlee, who directed Raja Rani (2013), cites Thalapathi as the main inspiration that led him to consider a career in cinema. Soundarya has stated Rajinikanth's hairstyle in her directorial venture Kochadaiiyaan (2014) was inspired by his appearance in Thalapathi. Baradwaj Rangan compared Kadal (2013) to Thalapathi, both of which feature a character \"who yearns for a lost mother and who is coerced into a life of crime\"."

The film is directed by Larry Charles, who previously directed Baron Cohen's mockumentaries Borat and Br\u00fcno. Baron Cohen, in the role of Admiral General Aladeen, the dictator of the fictional Republic of Wadiya visiting the United States, stars alongside Anna Faris, Ben Kingsley, and Jason Mantzoukas with uncredited appearances by John C. Reilly and Garry Shandling.\nProducers Jeff Schaffer and David Mandel said that Baron Cohen's character was inspired by real-life dictators with personality cults like Kim Jong Il, Idi Amin, Muammar Gaddafi, Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa, Mobutu Sese Seko, and Saparmurat Niyazov. The film's opening credits sarcastically dedicate it \"in loving memory\" to Kim Jong-il. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $179 million."

        "content": "For years, the fictional North African republic of Wadiya (shown in the map as coterminous with the boundaries of real-life Eritrea) has been ruled by ruthless dictator Omar Aladeen, and later succeeded by his son Admiral-General Haffaz Aladeen, a childish, sexist, anti-Western, and antisemitic dictator who surrounds himself with female bodyguards, sponsors terrorism (especially giving shelter to al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden after \"they killed his double a year ago\"), changes many words in the Wadiyan dictionary to \"Aladeen\", and is working on developing nuclear weapons to \"destroy Israel\". He also refuses to sell Wadiya's oil fields, a promise he made to his father before his death. After the United Nations Security Council resolves to intervene militarily, Aladeen travels to the UN Headquarters in New York City to address the council.\nShortly after arriving, Aladeen is kidnapped by Clayton, supposedly in charge of the security preparations but actually a hitman hired by his treacherous uncle Tamir Mafraad, whom Omar passed over as successor in favor of his son. Tamir then replaces Aladeen with a dim-witted decoy named Efawadh, whom he intends to manipulate into signing a document nominally democratizing Wadiya while opening up the country's oil fields to foreign interests. Aladeen escapes after Clayton accidentally burns himself to death in a failed torture attempt. When his burnt corpse is discovered, Tamir thinks Aladeen has been killed. However, Aladeen is practically unrecognizable as his beard has been burned off.\nWandering through New York City in civilian clothes, Aladeen, assuming the false identity of \"Allison Burgers\", encounters Zoey, a human rights activist who offers him a job at her socially progressive, alternative lifestyle co-op. Aladeen refuses the offer and encounters \"Nuclear\" Nadal, the former chief of Wadiya's nuclear weapons programme, whom Aladeen thought he had previously executed over an argument about the weapon's design. Aladeen follows him to New York's \"Little Wadiya\" district, which is populated by refugees from his own country, and meets him in \"Death to Aladeen Restaurant\", a restaurant run by and visited by numerous people whom Aladeen had ordered to be executed. After a failed attempt to cover up his identity, Aladeen is accused of being an \"Aladeen sympathizer\" by the restaurant's waiter and nearby visitors. Nadal saves Aladeen from being attacked and reveals to Aladeen that all the people he had ordered to be executed are instead sent into exile to the United States, as the executioners are actually a resistance movement against him. Nadal agrees to help Aladeen thwart Tamir's plot and regain his power, on condition that Aladeen makes him head of Wadiya's nuclear programme again. Aladeen agrees and accepts Zoey's job offer, as she is catering at the hotel where the signing is to occur. Aladeen grows closer to Zoey after she refuses his sexual advances and eventually falls in love with her after seeing her angry. Turning around Zoey's struggling business, Aladeen begins imposing strict schedules on everyone, forming a personality cult around Zoey and intimidating an inspector into giving the store a good review.\nHowever, Aladeen's relationship with Zoey becomes strained after he decides to be honest with her and reveal his true self; she cannot love a man who was so brutal to his own people. After acquiring a new beard taken from a black man's corpse at his funeral, Aladeen ziplines into the hotel and tells Efawadh he has recovered; his double was fooled into thinking the Supreme Leader was ill. At the signing ceremony, he tears up Tamir's document in front of the media and holds an impassioned speech praising the virtues of dictatorship, drawing unintended parallels to current issues in the United States. However, upon seeing Zoey in the room, he declares his love for her and, knowing Zoey's strongly-held views, vows to democratize his country and open up Wadiya's oil fields for business, but in a way where the general populace will benefit. Furious with Aladeen staying in power, Tamir attempts to shoot him but Efawadh jumps in front of the bullet getting shot in the head, but survives. Tamir is arrested afterwards.\nA year later, Wadiya holds its first democratic elections, although they are rigged in favor of Aladeen (who has now added the title \"President-Prime Minister\" to his previous Admiral-General). Afterwards, he marries Zoey, but is shocked when she breaks a glass with her foot and reveals herself to be Jewish; throughout the film he was shown vowing to destroy Israel. Scenes during the credits show Aladeen's convoy, now consisting of eco-friendly cars, Aladeen visiting a re-instated Nadal, and later Zoey revealing in a television interview that she is pregnant with the couple's first child. Aladeen responds to the news by asking if Zoey is having \"a boy or an abortion\"."

Kristen Wiig and Gillian Jacobs had been considered for the role that Anna Faris eventually played and which Variety said \"calls for strong improvisational skills\".

Baron Cohen said the United Nations refused to let him film scenes inside the UN Headquarters and claimed they explained this by saying, \"we represent a lot of dictators, and they are going to be very angry by this portrayal of them, so you can't shoot in there.\" When asked about it, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's spokesman commented by saying only, \"Sacha Baron Cohen has a wonderful sense of humor.\" The United Nations shots were at a soundstage at Grumman Studios in Bethpage, New York.Although Aladeen is portrayed as antisemitic and wishes to destroy Israel, the \"Wadiyan\" language he speaks throughout the film is actually Hebrew, as Baron Cohen is himself Jewish."

Audiences polled by CinemaScore during opening weekend gave the film an average grade of \"C\" on a scale ranging from A+ to F.Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of a possible four, saying, \"The Dictator is funny, in addition to being obscene, disgusting, scatological, vulgar, crude and so on.

Gone is the con-man comedian, fooling celebrities and the public with fictional characters. Gone, too, is the mockumentary style that he and his director on Borat, Bruno and now this film, Larry Charles, made their own. The Dictator is the kind of conventional feature that Peter Sellers, Tony Hancock or even Mike Myers could have made.\u201d The publication also claimed that \u201cit's likely to offend prudes of both the sexually and politically correct persuasions.\u201dThe Washington Post wrote that \u201cCohen has thankfully dispensed with ambushing real-life people for squirm-inducing interviews. But an early stunt involving a Wii game based on the 1972 Munich Olympics falls flatter than a stale matzo, a running gag about Hollywood stars selling sexual favors quickly loses steam and it can be stipulated that rape jokes simply aren't funny.\u201d"

During the journey, Susan has a shipboard romance with Conn White (Grant Williams), a wealthy young mountain climber. Susan and Conn make love in secret and plan to marry, but Conn wants to hold off making any announcement to their families until after he returns from his scheduled trip to Alaska to climb Mount McKinley.  He travels on to Anchorage, while Susan and her parents go to Monterey and move into a home provided by Roger's grateful employer and longtime friend, Stanton Corbett (Brian Aherne). Roger has a serious heart condition which he has kept from his wife and daughter so as not to worry them; he has confided only in Stanton, who gave him a house, laboratory and life income so that Roger could rest and recover while giving his wife and daughter social opportunities.\nSusan waits eagerly for letters from Conn, but he does not write and the one time he calls, she is out and misses the call. She soon discovers that she is pregnant with Conn's child, but keeps this a secret while urgently trying to contact Conn. Her parents attempt to take her mind off Conn by encouraging her to date the Corbetts' son Wells (Bert Convy) and buying her a horse, which is kept at the stables run by Hoyt Brecker (Troy Donahue). Hoyt is shunned by the local community because his father, an executive with Corbett's company, was convicted for stealing from his employer, and later committed suicide in his prison cell. Compared to Susan's family and friends, Hoyt is relatively poor and lives on what he can earn from his stables (which have lost many customers due to the scandal involving his father) and as a struggling writer. Despite all this, Hoyt and Susan gradually become friends and he confides in her his determination to not run away in the face of local disapproval, but to instead become a renowned writer and redeem his family name.\nSusan finally receives a telephone call from Conn's father, whom she has never met, informing her that Conn had told his parents of his love for her and that Conn died climbing Denali. Susan has a breakdown and tries to drown herself in the bay, but is rescued by Hoyt. In her delirium, she lets slip to her mother that she is pregnant by Conn. Roger and Leah decide the only way to avoid disgrace and protect Susan is for the family to move to remote Guatemala, where Roger has been offered a two-year job running a mine. Susan can then finish her pregnancy and have her baby in secret, and Leah and Roger will pass it off as their own. All goes according to plan, but after the baby (named \"Rogey\" after Susan's father) is born, Susan has difficulty setting aside her maternal feelings and treating the baby as her brother rather than her son.\nRoger's heart condition worsens due to the stressful work at the mine, and he suddenly dies. Leah, Susan and baby Rogey return to their Monterey home, which Susan is dismayed to find has now been fixed up by the unsuspecting Corbetts to give her an apartment of her own, separated from the baby's room. Hoyt and Susan, who have been writing to each other regularly, renew their friendship and Hoyt professes his love for Susan, but Wells Corbett also begins to court Susan and soon proposes. Leah pushes Susan to accept Wells' proposal, but warns her never to tell Wells or anyone else the truth about Rogey's parentage, for fear that Rogey, Susan and the family name will be disgraced. Susan is reluctant to marry anyone because she would not be able to be honest with her future husband, but finally decides to marry Wells, just as Hoyt sells his first book to a publisher and rushes to tell Susan the good news.\nHoyt and Susan argue over her decision to marry Wells, as Hoyt has a grudge against the Corbetts and also thinks Susan does not really love Wells. As they argue, baby Rogey accidentally sets himself on fire while playing with a cigarette lighter. Rogey is rushed to the hospital and the Corbetts, Slades and Hoyt all wait to hear the outcome. The doctor finally announces that Rogey will survive, but is seriously hurt and only his mother can see him. Susan, unable to hold back any longer, reveals that she is Rogey's true mother, which causes Wells to rescind his marriage proposal, although his father Stanton praises Susan for her honesty. However, Hoyt's feelings for Susan have not changed. Susan professes her true love for Hoyt, and they embrace."

Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland portray Laura and John Baxter, a married couple who travel to Venice following the recent accidental death of their daughter, after John accepts a commission to restore a church. They encounter two sisters, one of whom claims to be clairvoyant and informs them that their daughter is trying to contact them and warn them of danger.

The film is renowned for its innovative editing style, recurring motifs and themes, and for a controversial sex scene that was explicit by the standards of contemporary mainstream cinema. It also employs flashbacks and flashforwards in keeping with the depiction of precognition, but some scenes are intercut or merged to alter the viewer's perception of what is really happening. It adopts an impressionist approach to its imagery, often presaging events with familiar objects, patterns and colours using associative editing techniques.\nThe film's reputation has grown in the years since its release and it is now considered a classic and an influential work in horror and British film."

Afterwards, they go out to dinner, and en route get lost and briefly become separated. John catches a glimpse of a small figure wearing a red coat similar to the one Christine was wearing when she died.\nThe next day, Laura meets with Heather and Wendy, who hold a s\u00e9ance to try to contact Christine. When she returns to the hotel, Laura informs John that Christine said he is in danger and must leave Venice. John argues with Laura, but that night they receive a telephone call informing them that their son has been injured in an accident at boarding school. Laura departs for England, while John stays on to complete the restoration. Shortly afterward, John is nearly killed in an accident at the church when the scaffold he is standing on collapses, and he interprets this as the \"danger\" foretold by the sisters.\nLater that day, assuming that Laura is in England, John is shocked when he spots her on a passing boat in a funeral cortege, accompanied by the sisters. Concerned about his wife's mental state and with reports of a serial killer at large in Venice, John reports Laura's seeming disappearance to the police. The inspector investigating the killings is suspicious of John and has him followed. After conducting a futile search for Laura and the sisters\u2014during which he again sees the childlike figure in the red coat\u2014John contacts his son's school to enquire about his condition, only to discover that Laura is actually there. After speaking to her to confirm she really is in England, a bewildered John returns to the police station to inform the police he has found his wife. In the meantime, the police have brought Heather in for questioning, and an apologetic John offers to escort her back to the hotel.\nShortly after returning to the hotel, Heather slips into a trance. John quickly leaves. Upon coming out of the trance, Heather pleads with her sister to go after John, sensing that something terrible is about to happen, but Wendy is unable to catch up with him. Meanwhile, John catches another glimpse of the mysterious figure in red and this time pursues it. He corners the figure in a deserted palazzo and approaches, believing it to be a child. The figure turns to face him, revealing that it is a hideous female dwarf. When John freezes in shock, the dwarf pulls out a meat cleaver and cuts his throat. Dying, John realises too late that the strange sightings he experienced were premonitions of his own murder and funeral."

He breaks the windows of the wedding car and is hence arrested and sent to the nearest police station.\nMeanwhile, Anu (Anu Aggarwal) runs away from an oppressive girls' hostel run by Arnie Campbell (Tom Alter), who immediately reports to the police station that she is missing. The police catch her and keep her at a nearby police station (which happens to be the same one where Rahul is held).\nWhile waiting for Arnie, Rahul offers Anu his jacket, which she accepts. Arnie then arrives and takes her back to the oppressive hostel, promising the police inspector that this will not happen again. After they leave, the inspector turns to Rahul and offers him some advice, then releases him to return to his broken home.\nRahul can not stop thinking about the beautiful Anu. The very next day, Rahul goes to the hostel area wishing to meet her and spots his jacket hanging outside. Since she lives in a girl's hostel there is no way he can enter. Hence, he plays cricket with his friend and deliberately hits the ball into the compound. The security lets him inside to retrieve the ball. Rahul goes inside and sees Anu climbing a ladder. She is very surprised by his presence and falls off the ladder. Rahul is unable to express his feelings for her so he wrote a note on the electricity bill his mother told him to pay that very day. Anu takes the note and leaves. His mother becomes upset that Rahul did not pay the bill and asks his Master (tailor) to help get the bill back.\nThe tailor helps Rahul retrieve the bill, along with a reply from Anu requesting him to meet her at the main city library the following Saturday. He arrives on time eagerly, where Anu tells him she has nothing to give him except a \"thank you\", but Rahul says no one can stop him from loving her, not even herself.\nSoon after he leaves, Arnie catches her and takes her to Ooty (another town) to be admitted to another hostel. Rahul employs a spy to eavesdrop and see where Anu is going. The spy learns about Anu's travel plans and informs Rahul, who goes along with his friend to search for Anu and finds the place she is staying. They find out that Arnie actually planned to get Anu married and lied to her about transferring her to a new hostel, because she would not have agreed.\nAt the hostel, Arnie organises a farewell party for Anu and Anu invites Rahul, who promises to attend the party. After the party they plan to elope. At the party, he runs away with Anu and then Arnie catches them by using the police. Anu has to return with Arnie and go to Ooty, while Rahul returns to his home.\nAfter a few months, Rahul approaches Mr. Arnie as he can not forget his friend Anu, who he knows is unhappy. Rahul then finds out from Arnie that Anu is an orphan who has a distant relative in Ooty named Uncle Peter who is an alcoholic. Long long ago, Peter had signed the documents to have full custody over her.\nRahul asks Arnie about Anu's whereabouts and other details so that he could help her settle (and be more happy) and Arnie (wanting to help Anu) reveals everything. They both find Anu in a miserable state with Uncle Peter and bribe the uncle for a sum of 20,000 rupees on the condition that he signs documents giving up his legal guardianship of Anu.\nAfter Anu is finally free from Arnie, the hostel and Uncle Peter, she wishes to become self-reliant and seeks admission in a typing institute. \nOne day, she comes across a job advert searching for a model to run for \"Jean Cardin\" brand of clothes in Mumbai who requests Anu to audition. \nAnu agrees and wins a sum of 10,000 rupees along with a free tour of Paris and a secured residence. She thanks Rahul for all his help, but Rahul tells her that he loves her deeply and wants to marry her as soon as possible. Anu agrees, but she says she will need some time to prepare.\nRahul's mother (Reema Lagoo), on hearing their story visits Anu and offers some advice, as she knows Anu is a lonely orphan, advising her not to marry him until he achieves something in life as equality of status between partners is essential for a healthy relationship.\nThe next day, Rahul comes to the place where Anu is having a photo shoot session. He hears the man in charge telling her to change into a swimming costume, to which Rahul objects. He tells him that they were planning to get married soon and he disapproves of such revealing clothes. He is even more shocked when he learns that Anu already signed a contract promising she would not get married for two years.\nRahul is heartbroken by her decision and pens Anu a letter written with his blood.\nAs the years go by, Rahul establishes himself as a singer while Anu is also successful as a model. Rahul plans to meet Anu now, but Padamsee (Homi Wadia) reveals to Rahul that it's thanks to Anu that his debut record was released to market, which hurts Rahul deeply as he now doubts his own mettle and talent. Hence, Rahul cancels their marriage plans.\nAnu, grieved by Rahul's decision, decides to further her career under director Padamsee, who persuades her to accompany him to Paris.\nRahul's mother enlightens him that Anu had refused to marry him earlier because of her suggestion, and that Anu was only a medium for his talent to reach the public - it was his singing that made him successful and popular. She urges him to go back to Anu, his true love.\nWhen Rahul comes to stop her from boarding the flight, Anu agrees to abandon the director and stays behind to renew their relationship."

Inspired by the biblical story of Noah's Ark from the Book of Genesis and the Book of Enoch, it stars Russell Crowe as Noah, along with Jennifer Connelly, Ray Winstone, Emma Watson, Logan Lerman, and Anthony Hopkins.\nThe film was released in North American theaters on March 28, 2014, in 2D and IMAX, while a version converted to 3D and IMAX 3D was released in several other countries. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed over $362 million worldwide, making it Aronofsky's highest-grossing film to date.\nAlthough it received praise for its direction and acting, the film also generated controversy for its perceived environmentalist political messages and extensive use of non-biblical sources for inspiration, such as the Book of Enoch. It was denied release in China for (according to an anonymous source) \"religion-related reasons\", and was banned in several Muslim countries for its depiction of prophets venerated in Islam."

        "content": "As a child, Noah sees his father, Lamech, killed by king Tubal-cain for his land. As an adult, Noah lives with his wife, Naameh, and their sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth. He dreams of a great flood, so he takes his family to consult his grandfather, Methuselah.\nOn the way, they come across a group of recently killed people and adopt the lone survivor, a girl named Ila. She is treated for an abdominal wound, and Naameh determines she will be unable to bear children. The group is chased by the murderers and escapes into the land of the Watchers, fallen angels that were stranded on Earth as stone creatures after they descended from Heaven to help Adam and Eve when they were banished from the Garden of Eden for eating the Forbidden Fruit.\nMethuselah helps Noah understand his visions and gives him a seed from Eden, which he plants nearby. The Watchers arrive the next morning, and, while some presume he is a liar, water spouts from where Noah planted the seed and a mature forest pops up around them. The Watchers are convinced he is serving the Creator. They help him build an ark to preserve life for after the Flood.\nYears later, Tubal-cain notices a huge flock of birds flying to the almost-completed ark and leads his followers to confront Noah, who defies Tubal-cain and remarks that there is no escape for the line of Cain whose sins ravaged the land. When the Watchers form a defensive circle, Tubal-cain retreats and begins to build weapons to take the ark. Many animals come to the ark and are sedated with incense to sleep through the Flood.\nWith Ila in love with Shem, Noah goes to the refugee camp to find wives for his sons. When he witnesses the people's moral decay, he abandons his effort. Devastated by the idea of being alone his entire life, Ham runs into the forest. Naameh begs Noah to reconsider and, when he will not, goes to Methuselah for help. The old man cures Ila's infertility, while Ham befriends a refugee named Na'el.\nWhen the rain begins, Tubal-cain incites his followers to storm the ark. Noah finds Ham in the forest, but leaves Na'el, who is stuck in a foothold trap and is trampled to death. His family enters the ark, except for Methuselah, who remains in the forest and is swept away by the rushing waters. The Watchers hold off Tubal-cain's army, sacrificing themselves and ascending back to heaven. Tubal-cain slips onto the ark and solicits help from Ham, playing on the boy's anger towards Noah for Na'el's demise.\nIla discovers she is pregnant and tells Noah, who pleads with God not to make him kill the child. The rains stop, indicating that God wants the child to die, so Noah tells his family that, if the baby is a girl, he will kill her to ensure the future will be uncorrupted by humans.\nNine months later, Ila goes into labor as she and Shem are about to leave the ark on a raft. Naameh begs Noah to spare the child so they will stay, but, instead, he burns the raft. Ham interrupts to tell Noah the beasts are awake and eating each other, which is a ruse so Tubal-cain can attack him. While they fight, Ila gives birth to female twins and the ark hits a mountaintop. Shem attacks his father and Tubal-cain is about to strike Noah with a rock, but Ham kills Tubal-cain with a dagger. Noah finds Ila, intending to kill the babies, but spares them because he finds nothing but love in his heart when he sees his newborn granddaughters.\nUpon exiting the ark, Noah, thinking he has failed the Creator and deeming himself a monster, goes into isolation in a cave and makes wine to drown his sorrows. Ham, after witnessing  his father's naked drunkenness, leaves to travel alone. Reconciling with his remaining family at Ila's behest, Noah charges his progeny with caring for the world and they witness intense waves of rainbows as symbols of the Creator's blessings."

Trevor's social worker, Harry Parker takes him to Hooper Street Residential Assessment Centre, where his punishment will be determined. The centre's deputy superintendent, Peter Clive, admits Trevor and he is allocated a room with Errol.The next day, Trevor leaves the assessment center to look for jobs. Trevor and Errol break into a car and drive to the center. Trevor barges past the queue, demanding a job from the attendant. When asked to wait, he storms out and hurls a brick through the window. After escaping, he breaks into another car, and takes it and drives away.Inside the assessment centre, Trevor does not cooperate. He demands lunch, only to be informed that he is too late. Trevor viciously attacks the chef before being stopped by care worker Barry Giller. Trevor is then held down by the chef and Barry, and locked up in a room.The superintendent arrives and tells Trevor that he is heading to prison. He explains that the assessment centre is Trevor's last chance to change the cycle of poverty, crime and prison. Uncharacteristically, Trevor is not aggressive and is lost for words. As soon as the superintendent leaves, Trevor is back to his usual self. He rants about his views on race, authority, and the British educational and correctional systems. Eventually, Barry and Peter decide to send him to a secure unit. However, while Barry is out making arrangements to send Trevor away, Peter offers to take Trevor banger racing if he promises to behave. Trevor accepts.\nThey go to the races and Trevor is given a chance to drive. Trevor seems to enjoy the experience, but gets into an accident, after which his car will not restart. Trevor cannot complete the race. On the drive back to the assessment center, Peter informs Trevor that he could join a racing team if he wishes and would need not steal cars any longer.\nAfter everybody has retired to bed, Trevor wakes up Errol and shows him Peter's keys, which he had taken. Trevor and Errol make their way into the office and Trevor finds their respective files. Trevor finds a report which says Errol will likely never return home. He drops the files on the floor and tells Errol to urinate and defecate on it. Errol defecates on his files, and Trevor urinates on his.Trevor and Errol leave the center, and drive away in the Ford Transit van. They reach Mr. Shahnawaz's neighbourhood and hurl stones through the windows and scream racial slurs. They get into the van and drive away. Trevor drives to a police station, and smashes the van into a car. Errol is rendered unconscious by the impact. Trevor exits the van and runs away, leaving Errol to be apprehended by the police.The next day, Trevor arrives at Harry's home. Harry tells him to go back to the assessment center, before it is too late. Trevor informs Harry of his misadventures, and tells him that he is turning himself in. Harry makes the necessary calls to the police.Trevor presses the buzzer in the room of the prison cell. The police officer orders him to keep his hands off the buzzer. Trevor walks away, but returns and proceeds to press the buzzer with his head. This time, another officer, PC Anson enters, with a truncheon. Trevor continues to provoke the officer. Anson tells Trevor that he would be taken to court in a few days, and this time he will end up in a detention centre or a borstal, not an assessment centre. Anson brings the truncheon down, hitting Trevor on the kneecap. Anson smiles and says, 'You think you're hard, don't you?' Trevor looks defeated. The warder tells Trevor that he is all talk and has no choice but to respect authority and obey the rules, like everybody else.\nThe film ends with Trevor recovering from the pain and grinning, as the warders shut the door of the cell."

        "content": "After successful collaborations on previous projects like Beloved Enemy and Psy-Warriors, writer David Leland and director Alan Clarke were keen to team up again. Producer Margaret Matheson, who had worked with both Leland and Clarke before (most notably on the original version of Scum) was taking over as Head of Drama at the then-newly created Central Television. Matheson was keen to develop a project about education and a series of four one-off plays eventually broadcast under the umbrella title Tales Out of School was commissioned.\nDavid Leland, when interviewed in 1998, recalled that Clarke was initially reluctant to commit to the directing duties of Made in Britain - \"he was trying then to do Contact; his mind was elsewhere [...] it was only because we were friends, we could meet and talk about Made in Britain.\"\nMade in Britain is notable as one of the first British television dramas (and Clarke's first production) to make use of the steadicam. Fellow director Stephen Frears, who at that point was in the process of editing his film Walter, noted that his cameraman on that project - Chris Menges - was a \"huge influence\" on Clarke using the steadicam. Recalling the filming process in a 1998 interview, he noted that \"Made in Britain was written very powerfully, and it had these rather long sequences which posed certain technical problems [...] he [Clarke] found a piece of equipment that liberated him from that.\" Clarke became so enamored with the technical properties of the steadicam that it would be used repeatedly during the rest of his filmed work throughout the 1980s, most notably on the BBC dramas Christine (1986), Road (1987), Elephant and The Firm (both 1989). Former BBC director of plays Chris Morahan noted that \"Steadicam was the trigger for his creativity.\"\nDespite being a production relatively free of complications, problems arose with the filming of the original ending. As scripted, the final shot of the production was to feature Trevor, now confined to a borstal, digging trenches in the backyard with all the other inmates and encouraging them to 'dig for Britain'. As David Leland noted in a 2016 interview accompanying the re-release of the play for Tales Out of School DVD collection, \"I'm a country boy...I assumed everyone knew what trenching was.\" Director Clarke misunderstood the directions in the script, resulting in a scene where the borstal inmates are digging seemingly randomly placed holes. Deemed unsatisfactory and with insufficient funds to re-film it, the televised film closes on a freeze-frame of Trevor's grinning face in police custody. Screenshots and script directions from the original ending are enclosed on the aforementioned DVD."

Living in an apartment full of precise stacks of books, his half-hearted attempts to kill himself are continually interrupted by the people around him. Kenji's most notable obstacle is his self-absorbed brother, Yukio, a yakuza, or Japanese gangster. Yukio fled from Japan to escape the wrath of his employer, with whose daughter he had had sex. Yukio's friend Takashi suggests that if it were his daughter, he would have the despoiler killed, but Kenji's brother laughs this warning off. Yukio frequents a club where he can enjoy the attention of a bunny-eared hostess, a local girl named Nid. Nid's sister, Noi, is furious at her sibling for having slept with her boyfriend, Jon.\nOne day in the library, Kenji spies on Nid, clad in a school girl's uniform. Soon after, he discovers that his brother has hidden a pistol inside a teddy bear. He is about to shoot himself when Yukio is slain by Takashi, who was apparently hired by Yukio's employer. (During the library scene where Kenji first encounters Nid, a hanging poster for the Takashi Miike film Ichi the Killer is clearly featured. Tadanobu Asano was also the star of that film.)\nTakashi sees Kenji, who appears hopeful at his impending death, but suddenly Kenji shoots and kills the assassin. Not long after that, Kenji is about to jump off a bridge when Noi and Nid, driving past, have an argument. Noi throws Nid out of the car, then reconsiders. Nid, distracted by Kenji sitting on the railing of the bridge, is struck by another car and dies.\nKenji and Noi, both having lost a sibling, form a tentative friendship. The introspective Kenji asks the extroverted Noi if he can stay with her, unwilling to spend time with the two corpses in his apartment. Noi agrees, and invites the fussy Japanese man into her disastrously unkempt beachside home. As Kenji begins cleaning, Noi prepares to leave for Japan to further her career. Surreal elements creep into the film; Noi sees the house magically cleaning itself, while Kenji watches Noi transform into her temptress sister. The couple, in some ways polar opposites and in some ways mirror images, form a semi-romantic relationship. Meanwhile, the abusive and promiscuous ex-boyfriend Jon begins calling, angry that Noi thinks she can leave him. Three yakuza are also dispatched to find out what has happened to Takashi.\nIn the final segments, Kenji drives Noi to the airport, then decides he will join her. He returns to his apartment to gather his things and purposely knocks over a stack of books. While he is in the bathroom, first Jon, then the yakuza arrive. Jon is slain, and Kenji apparently escapes out the window. The movie then cuts back and forth between two scenes: one, in which Kenji has been arrested for some unspecified crime, and another in which he is re-united with Noi in Japan. The relationship between or canonicity of these two scenes is not made clear by the movie - particularly whether the reuniting scene is imagined or not.\nThroughout the movie, images of the furtive gecko who lives in Noi's house, as well as The Last Lizard are shown, Kenji's children's book about a reptile who wakes up to discover he is the final member of his species. The fictional lizard realizes that even being with his enemies, the other lizards who picked on him, was preferable to being alone."

Ray started working on the documentary in early 1958. Shot in black-and-white, the finished film was released during the birth centenary year of Rabindranath Tagore, who was born on 7 May 1861. Ray avoided the controversial aspects of Tagore's life in order to make it as an official portrait of the poet. Though Tagore was known as a poet, Ray did not use any of Tagore's poetry as he was not happy with the English translation and believed that \"it would not make the right impression if recited\" and people would not consider Tagore \"a very great poet,\" based on those translations. Satyajit Ray has been reported to have said about the documentary Rabindranath Tagore in his biography Satyajit Ray: The Inner Eye by W. Andrew Robinson that, \"Ten or twelve minutes of it are among the most moving and powerful things that I have produced.\"Often regarded as polymath, author of Gitanjali and its \"profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse,\" Tagore became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913. The first stanza of Tagore's five-stanza Brahmo hymn has been adopted as the National Anthem of India, \"Jana Gana Mana.\" The first ten lines of another Tagore song, \"Amar Shonar Bangla\" were adopted in 1972 as the Bangladesh's national anthem. Incidentally, Sri Lanka's national anthem \"Sri Lanka Matha\" was written and composed by Tagore's student, Ananda Samarakoon.Academy Film Archive, part of the Academy Foundation, took an initiative to restore Satyajit Ray's films and could successfully restore 19 Ray films, Rabindranath Tagore is restored though its original print was found to be badly damaged.

While documentary mentions Dwarkanath Tagore's elder son Debendranath Tagore's association with an Indian religious, social, and educational reformer Raja Rammohun Roy and introduces some of his children out of fourteen, it moves to the birth of child Rabindranath Tagore, fondly called as \"Robi\". The film then narrates Robi's initial schooling days, his trip to northern India with his father, publication of his first poem in his father's magazine and his failed attempt for higher education at London.\nThe documentary showcases some of the scenes of Tagore's first drama-opera, Valmiki Pratibha (The Genius of Valmiki), where he used western classical music along with Raga-based songs to narrate sage Valmiki's story and himself acted in the lead role. Mentioning about his marriage with Mrinalini Devi, the documentary explains his aim to form a new school at Santiniketan and its different education system, death of his wife and children in the short span of time and his association in Indian independence movement. It then narrates Tagore's visit to England in 1912 where his English translated poems from Gitanjali were introduced to English painter William Rothenstein, who in-turn showed them to the Irish poet W. B. Yeats. This helped Gitanjali for its publication in England and fetched Tagore the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913 and a Knighthood in 1915.\nWhile showcasing Tagore's formation of Visva-Bharati University, the documentary mentions his renouncement of his knighthood, in response to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919.

He starts wooing a nurse called Saara who keeps some distance from him due to his approach. Then one day, on his father's insistence he goes to deliver mridangam to Vembu Iyer's concert where he is allowed to watch his program. After observing Iyer's concert, Peter starts admiring him and decides to join as a student to learn mridangam from him.\nAfter observing Peter, Iyer understands that he has talent but rejects him due to his lack of discipline and consistency. To prove Iyer wrong, Peter tries hard to change himself which constoned by his mother and worried about his future. Finally Iyer allows Peter as his student.\nPeter is mistreated by Iyer's assistant Mani because of his lower caste. This is noticed by Iyer, who warns Mani to be good with his students. Mani confesses his dissatisfaction over Iyer, saying he did not support his career as a mridangam player and used him. This angers Iyer, who sacks him from the job in front of Peter, so Mani swears revenge on Iyer and Peter for his humiliation.\nPeter becomes good friends with Nandagopal 'Nandu', a NRI and a Harvard University PhD drop-out who came to learn mridangam from Iyer. Meanwhile, Mani joins as a judge in a classical music instrument reality show called 'Sangeetha Samrat' with the help of his younger sister Anjana who is a crooked socialite and works as a VJ. Peter is very passionate about the beats of mridangam and becomes one of the favourite students of Iyer. Meanwhile, Saara realises her love for Peter and they start dating.\nAnjana sets a trap to humiliate Iyer. She invites Nandu to perform on her reality show and makes him believe that it was telecasted only in the USA. Nandu comes along with Peter, who consistently warns him to not perform without their teacher's permission. After knowing that it was a trap to humiliate them, Nandu leaves the place without any warning to Peter. Without knowing the facts, Peter enters the studio to find Nandu, but he is focused on \"live\". Then with no option left, Peter gets ready to play mridangam which gets severely humiliated by Mani and Anjana, making him seem useless and directly criticise Iyer. After learning of this, Iyer questions Peter on why he went to perform on the stage. Peter takes the blame on himself to save Nandu. The angered Iyer sends Peter away saying that it is a real humiliation for his musical knowledge for believing in such a useless student.\nLater at Nandu's home, Nandu blames Peter for his mistakes and Peter challenges Nandu saying that he will be overpowered by him one day. After these events, Peter became depressed and started taking drugs, which worries his parents. This is noticed by Saara who takes him to her home. Later she makes him realise that the music is everywhere and built in nature and encourages him to explore the world to learn Thaalam (beats). Inspired by these words, Peter starts a journey on his own way to learn different types of beat instruments.\nMeanwhile, the Sangeetha Samrat show becomes successful after completion of 2 successful seasons and all of Iyer's students including Nandu are fascinated over the popularity and leave him. Finally Iyer understands that he needs to mend his ways according to the world or else he cannot transfer his musical knowledge to the further generations. He realises that Peter is his heir for his knowledge of music and calls him back.\nPeter happily joins him back to continue learn mridangam to win the show and gain his teacher's respect back. Meanwhile, Nandu joins hands with Mani and started taking training from him to win the show. After learining that Iyer is also showing interest in this show and that Peter is also participating in this show, the duo become cautious. However Peter and Nandu managed to reach the finals in the program. Before starting the show, Peter forgets the beats that Iyer had taught him but surprisingly these are answered by Nandu to Iyer. Then Mani comes in front of them and challenges Iyer. He says that he will prove that he is a better teacher than Iyer and will humiliate both Iyer and Peter in front of everyone as revenge for his humiliation. This is why he has trained Nandu well in all of Iyer's compositions to counter them. After  hearing this Iyer advises Peter to stay on the same strategy.\nIn the show while countering Nandu, Peter remembers different beats of instrumental music that he has learned from the world and applies all the beats in the mridangam which gives joy to the audience. With no option left, Mani decides to declare Peter as the winner in the show which constoned by Nandu. Later Iyer leaves the stage which makes Peter afraid that his teacher is angry with him for not following his strategy. But Iyer feels proud of him and happily claims Peter as his student. The film ends with Peter, now a celebrity, performing along with his teacher Iyer."

Titled Sarvam Thaala Mayam, G. V. Prakash Kumar was signed on to play the lead role of a percussionist in the film, while A. R. Rahman was selected to compose the film's music. Pre-production work took place in mid-2016, and the team finalised Sai Pallavi to play the female lead role. Other actors including Nedumudi Venu and Cheenu Mohan were also approached to play key roles in the film, but production failed to take off in November 2016 as planned and the project was delayed.In March 2017, Menon denied that the film was dropped and noted that a promotional photo shoot with Prakash Kumar was imminent. Prakash Kumar revealed that the story was set in two states and was inspired by incidents from the lives of real musicians. During the period, Prakash Kumar also took professional mridangam lessons from percussionist Umayalpuram Sivaraman to equip himself for the character. After further brief delays, the film was officially launched on 29 November 2017 and the shoot began thereafter. Sai Pallavi's unavailability meant that the team replaced her with Aparna Balamurali, after Menon was impressed with her performance in the Malayalam film, Maheshinte Prathikaaram (2016), and called her for a successful audition. An ensemble cast of Nedumudi Venu, Santha Dhananjayan, Vineeth, Kumaravel, Sumesh and Athira was also announced with the launch, while Ravi Yadav and Anthony were confirmed as the film's cinematographer and editor respectively.

The Oscar, according to David O. Selznick in 1943, was won for 'effectiveness in depicting simply yet forcefully the scene of war in New Guinea and for its moving presentation of the bravery and fortitude of our Australian comrades in arms'.  In the documentary film, Australian troops from the 39th Battalion are shown along the Kokoda Track walking through a mountainous terrain and across a river. The film through the utilisation of voice actor Peter Bathurst exemplifies the cruel conditions, the bravery of the troops, and the support and care displayed by the Papuans.\nFootage of The Salvation Army includes a shot of Father Albert Moore lighting a cigarette of an injured soldier. The last series of shots in the film were captured from heightened positions along the track of the Papuan carrying wounded troops climbing through steep terrains in harsh conditions.\nParer's sheer fearlessness and devotion to his job played a crucial role in the production of Kokoda Front Line. The combat cameraman being made fully aware of the risk, Parer continued to film the campaign and routinely went to the frontline at Kokoda in order to fulfill his goal to present the true account of events as he saw them.  The nature of the mountainous terrain significantly negatively impacted Parer\u2019s ability to shoot long sequences that didn\u2019t include close-ups of the soldiers standing or trudging through the thick mud along the track. This therefore led to the film being extremely difficult to film, and ultimately led to the death of Damien Parer."

Parer through the use of close-ups and long shots captures the wounded and sick soldiers being carried on stretcher bearers and cared for by the Papuans. Prior to this, it was found Australian soldiers suffered more from illness than Japanese soldiers. The Japanese had previous exposure to this in November 1943 and came to the war prepared to combat disease in contrast to Australians. It was evident that in a study conducted by Australians that the Imperial Japanese Army were the 'most inoculated army in the world'.  The advantage of inoculation played a pivotal role in the initial success of the Japanese in the war prevented diseases such as malaria and scrub typhus.  This directly led to the evacuation of 1752 sick Australian soldiers in contrast to 343 sick Japanese soldiers.\nThe decisive moment in the war as depicted in the film was when Japanese casualties were higher than the Australian numbers. This can be directly attributed to supply problems. This is evident through the aerial footage of the thick jungle and vast green plains where supplies are being dropped off. The Australians found in prior operations in the Owen Stanley Range their supply system was inefficient. By trucking all supplies to the front line, 19 tons of supplies required for each 1000 Australian fighting men could be delivered daily. This led to aircraft shortages, and the daily requirement changed to 12 tons of supplies. This was the decisive point in the Kokoda Track campaign as the Japanese, mainly used a poor road system, budgeted six tons of supplies per thousand men per day. The advantage went to the Japanese as they focused on capturing enemy supplies and utilised simple items in food rations in contrast to the Australians, providing them a great advantage as the Australians were too dependent on the food rations."

The aerial footage in the film glanced over the thick jungle over a mountainous terrain, characterised with deep slopes of green plains. The environment is not a healthy environment as soldiers travelled along the track, their health began to decline. Studies at the time concluded that three months in New Guinea directly led to an identifiable decrease in the effectiveness of a unit regardless of being in a battle or not. This can be attributed to the cruel conditions of the environment as the length of the track is 96 kilometres (60 mi) and the climate is characterised by year-round humid days with intense cold nights, torrential rainfall and an increase risk of tropical diseases such as malaria, this makes the track difficult as it is physically demanding.As evident in Parer's footage of the flying aircraft and the Japanese troops along the road the effect of the environment directly impacted the supply line as neither side could maintain a supply line over its distance. The environment also provided problems for soldiers fighting in the jungles as the mountainous terrain, steep slopes and thick jungle interrupted communication. The visibility in the jungle as seen in the film is poor and gradually gets worse when there is fog and rain. This environment directly benefited the Japanese as shown in the film they used tactics of war as gun groups that usually had one group firing towards the enemy and another sweeping the enemy yet in the condition of the Kokoda Track unless the attacker had been fired on by the hidden enemy it was very hard to be aware of enemy presence.The narrator in the film referred to the Japanese as 'masters of camouflage'; the camouflage and deception displayed by the Japanese played a pivotal role in the early advancements of the Japanese as the treacherous terrain and rainfall significantly impacted the visibility."

        "content": "Kokoda Front Line! through Parer's cinematography of wounded soldiers and mountainous setting was able to emotionally capture the Australian audience. Parer's bravery through his determination to record the Australian troops heading towards battle played a pivotal role in portraying the emotional climax and the iconic moving images of Australians during the Second World War. As seen in the documentary there is a scene were a wounded soldier appears like a hero figure \u2013 with a damaged shirt and with his arms spread apart. Salvation Army officer Albert Moore offers him a cigarette. Cigarettes were used in the army as an antidepressant due to the traumatic events that soldiers experience during the war. The Salvation Army's refreshment centre was established on 6 September 1942 and chaplain Major Albert Moore, the centre was the main provider of beverages by producing an average of 204 litres (45 imp gal; 54 US gal) of coffee or hot tea. The film had soldiers captured in a cross-like figure which can be attributed to Parer\u2019s Catholic background which could have directly led to this imagery. The film did this in order to reassure their audience that God was protecting them as at the time Australia had a high Catholic background. In the news reel the troops are portrayed to be bold and courageous soldiers battling a ghost of an enemy.\nIn the newsreel there is also a distinct absence of the Japanese soldiers in the images and this is evident throughout the newsreel. This can be attributed to the tactical warfare established by the Japanese throughout the war. The narrator makes constant reference to the invisibility of the Japanese troops and this is due to the intelligence and deception levels. As the film was produced from an Australian perspective there is limited footage of Japanese soldiers, as in the film the only evidence of Japanese is masked behind the tropical terrain. Parer despite not utilising much footage of the Japanese troops managed to evoke an emotional drama that lies heavily on the depiction of the cruel conditions that the Australian troops had to overcome and the cunning narration.\nA key part of the film was the role of Papua and New Guinea territories in its assistance to the Australian troops in succeeding in the war. In the newsreel the Papuan carriers are shown as kind and quiet people and contribute significantly to the footage in the film. In the narration Bathurst through colloquial language that at the time was acceptable states that, the Papuan carriers in their aid to the Australian troops are 'black skinned boys that are white'.  This type of language will be recognised now as racist and discriminatory at the time was used to display the gratitude and respect they played in helping wounded Australian soldiers and educating the troops about the mountainous terrain and diseases."

        "content": "Parer's footage of the Kokoda Track campaign accompanied with the commentary built the emotional drama to Australians the true realities of the war in the Pacific; in later trying to capture the cruel conditions of the war Parer died filming footage of the Australian troops at war on the island of Peleliu.  Kokoda Front Line! was able to win the Oscar for the Best Documentary category in 1943 largely to Parer's film style as his ability to capture the everyday lives of troops anticipated the cinema-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style of the documentary. Jenifer Coombes, a film curator at the National Film and Sound Archive, said 'He liked the idea of introducing a dramatic element into the documentary by putting Damien into the role of narrator'.Years after the film's release despite the Oscar been in a vault, the role of the Kokoda Front Line! on the Australian psyche remains. The film has been a constant reminder to Australians particularly on Anzac Day of the courage it took the soldiers to overcome the mountainous terrain and is often used as a reference point to remember the soldiers that have lost their lives. The high casualty rates of approximately 625 Australians and over 1600 wounded severely impacted many Australian troop family members. The war also had everlasting psychological effects were soldiers suffered from PTSD due to prolonged exposure to enemy fire.\nThe rhetorical style of the narration played a pivotal role in enhancing the Australian audience sense that Australia was in danger and through the capturing of the tropical landscape were able to come to the realisation that the soldiers at any moment could have been killed. The narration also provides a strong indicator that propaganda films can still be very emotionally scaring.  The final image is emotionally moving and memorable. The film by capturing the soldiers with their ankles deep in mud portrays the 39th Battalion representing every Australian soldier playing the role for their country. The determination and talent portrayed by Parer through his shots composed with light on the soldiers face. There was a dispute between Ken Hall and Parer on who should narrate the film they held a briefing and decided Parer should speak on the film.\nThe Kokoda Front Line! also played a pivotal role in fostering positive relationships with today's Papua New Guinea, as Australia already had a relationship with the inhabitants. However, the kind acts of the Papuans and knowledge spread by them reassured Australians that in the event of jeopardy they would be there to help.\nThe film through the use of Parer's footage enhanced editing by Cinesound Review and the production used to produce the film."

Reddy who co-wrote the film with Pingali and Kamalakara Kameswara Rao. Shot simultaneously in Telugu and Tamil languages, the film was produced by Nagi Reddi and Chakrapani under the banner Vijaya Productions. It stars N. T. Rama Rao, S. V. Ranga Rao and K. Malathi. The film focuses on a gardener's son who has to amass wealth equal to that of the king of Ujjain to marry his daughter and a sorcerer who has to sacrifice an intelligent and brave young man to Goddess Pathala Bhairavi to gain access to a statuette which can grant any wish.\nPathala Bhairavi is based on Kasi Majilee Kathalu, written by Madhira Subbanna Deekshitulu, though it was also partially inspired by the story of Aladdin. As the film is shot as a bilingual, production lasted for a whole year starting from 5 February 1950 until 8 February 1951.

When the gardener's son 'Thota' Ramudu assaults Surasena at a concert for irritating the common people, he is summoned by the king to the court. His boldness leaves a considerable impression, but when Ramudu declares his love for Indu a day before his death sentence for meeting Indu secretly, the king is reminded of the astrologers' prediction that only a brave man can save her from a wicked sorcerer. He then challenges Ramudu to amass wealth equal to that of his to marry Indu, to which Ramudu agrees. He is released from prison.\nRamudu meets a Nepali sorcerer during the latter's magic show in a street. The sorcerer, who is ordered by Goddess Pathala Bhairavi during his prayers to sacrifice an intelligent and brave young man before her to be granted a statuette that grants any wish, feels that Ramudu is suitable for the sacrifice. While taking a holy bath in the nearby pond, Ramudu kills a crocodile that immediately transforms into a woman after being killed. The woman informs Ramudu that he had freed her from a hermit's curse and also reveals the sorcerer's intentions. Just before the sacrifice, Ramudu sacrifices the sorcerer and wins the statuette, consequently amassing wealth equal to that of the king. In return, the king lives up to his promise and accepts Indu's wishes to marry Ramudu.\nThe sorcerer's apprentice Sadajapa discovers his master dead at Pathala Bhairavi's shrine and brings him back to life with the help of Sanjeevani. Upon resurrection, the sorcerer makes a deal with Surasena, who was about to commit suicide, to bring the statuette in exchange for everything Ramudu has, including Indu. Surasena agrees and steals the statuette, then handing it over to the sorcerer which changes the fate of Ramudu and Indu, leaving the former penniless. Ramudu pledges to bring Indu his wealth back and leaves for the sorcerer's lair along with his cousin, Anji.\nWhile they are unable to locate the sorcerer's lair, Indu refuses the sorcerer's proposal to marry him. With the help of the statuette, the sorcerer brings Ramudu to his lair and tortures him in front of Indu with the hope that she would succumb to his proposal to marry him. Posing as Sadajapa, Anji requests the sorcerer to shave his beard to win Indu's heart. The sorcerer shaves his beard, losing his powers in the process. Afterward, Ramudu finds the statuette and wishes to bring the palace back to Ujjain. In a fight between Ramudu and the sorcerer mid-way in the sky, the latter is killed by Ramudu. The palace is back in Ujjain and Surasena apologises to both Ramudu and Indu before uniting them. While Anji marries Indu's best friend, the film ends with the marriage of Ramudu and Indu."

While the characters of Rama Rao and Ranga Rao epitomise heroism, the character of the princess played by Malathi epitomises innocence and sensuality. Pathala Bhairavi sets up an opposition between the worship of Rama by the protagonist's mother and the worship of Pathala Bhairavi by the sorcerer; the former being a frequent one inhabited in a domestic space while the latter being an uncivilised one.According to Azim Premji University liberal studies faculty member S. V. Srinivas, Pathala Bhairavi was a blend of folklore and social drama. Srinivas stated that the depiction of the goddess Pathala Bhairavi before Ramudu sacrifices the sorcerer was reminiscent of the representation of Poleramma worship by Dalits in the film Mala Pilla (1938). He added that Pathala Bhairavi \"ratifies certain social relationships by presenting them as natural and given\" and \"at the same time, some other practices are presented as inhuman and uncivilised\"."

When she doesn't return home by the end of the day, the villagers organise a search party. After hours of searching, they find the little girl on a branch protruding from the hill. She had been stuck on it for the entire day but couldn't call for help because of her disability. The following morning, her parents and neighbours discuss what must be done to help her. An older man suggests they take her to the shrine of Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya in Delhi, India. The religious family believes that visiting the holy shrine will bring peace and happiness and most importantly, restore Shahida's speech. Shahida's father used to be in the military and fought against the Indian army. He is sure that he won't be provided with a visa to India. Hence, her mother Razia takes it upon herself to travel far from the village for the first time. The trip goes as planned for the most part. The two reach the shrine, pay for offerings and get on a train back to their home country.\nOn the return journey, the train stops for repairs at night. When everyone is asleep, Shahida notices a sheep stuck in a pit right outside the train. She doesn't think much before going outside to help the animal. However, the train restarts before she can return to her mother. The little girl runs towards it but is eventually left behind. In a desperate attempt to go the same way that her mother did, she boards a freight train. But to her dismay, it goes reverse-path and stops in Kurukshetra, India. Razia notices her daughter is missing and stops the train. Policemen are appointed to look for the girl around the track where she was lost. However, they cannot find her since Shahida has already reached a different place. Razia meets her husband who is worried to death about his daughter. They cannot get an immediate visa back to India, much to their dismay. The parents have no other way but to pray that their daughter is safe.\nMeanwhile, Shahida is now lost in a different country with no way to communicate. At a religious celebration, she sees a stranger eating at a street-side restaurant. The stranger is the kind Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi who invites her to have a meal with him. After a few minutes of trying to get her to talk, he realises she is mute and starts calling her Munni. A starving Munni finishes the food and follows Pawan around. Assuming that she was separated from her parents during the festival, he asks her to stay in front of a temple. Pawan is a devout Hindu Brahmin and an ardent devotee of Lord Hanuman. He believes that Lord Hanuman will take Munni home if she stays in front of his temple. When Munni still doesn't stop following him, he brings her to the police station. But since she cannot tell them any details about her parents, the police can only wait for someone to file a missing complaint. Until her parents are found, Munni needs a place to stay, hence, Pawan takes her in. On his way to his home in Delhi, he tells Munni to call him Mama if she ever talks in the future. He also starts naming different Indian cities, asking her to nod if she knows what city her parents are in. All the passengers on the bus help him but none of them name cities outside of India. As they talk, Pawan tells everyone how he came to Delhi for work.\nA flashback shows the time he was in high school. He was an average student who could never pass the final examination. All his friends cheated and went on with their lives, but Pawan refused to cheat or lie, being a true devotee of Lord Hanuman. Eventually, he passed on his eleventh try and came to Delhi to look for work. He stayed with his father's friend, Pandey, a strict Hindu who refused to let the followers of any other religion enter his house. Pandey's daughter Rasika offered Pawan a job at the school she taught and fell in love with his innocent persona. But being the strict father he is, Pandey asked Pawan to build his own house before marrying his daughter. Even since then, Pawan and Rasika have been working hard to collect money. The two are bound to get married sometime next year. Everyone on the bus is impressed by his story. He and Munni reach his home where Rasika receives them in the doorway. She is glad that Pawan is helping a little girl in need but Pandey doesn't feel the same way. He is worried about the possibility that Munni belongs to a different religion. Pawan rationalises that she is Hindu because of her fair skin color and persuades Pandey to let her stay for a month. Munni cries every day in memory of her parents even though Pawan and Rasika treat her like their own daughter. Since the entire family is vegetarian, and Munni is accustomed to eating meat with every meal, she hardly ever finishes her food.\nOne day, Pawan and Rasika find her in a Muslim neighbour's home devouring home-cooked chicken. Pawan brings her to a restaurant that evening and lets her eat whatever she likes, even though eating meat is against his religion.  \nMunni is very fond of the glittery bangles they sell on the street side. One day while walking down a market, she innocently picks up a pack of bangles before being stopped by the vendor. Pawan makes her return it and takes her to the temple to apologise to God for stealing. As he teaches her to join her hands, Munni sneaks into a Mosque nearby. Pawan is hesitant to follow her inside but he does it anyway. To his utter surprise, he sees her reading the Quran in front of a shrine. For a few minutes, he feels like she betrayed him because he would have never befriended a Muslim. But Rasika makes him realise that she is a human before being Muslim. She hates that her father discriminates against people because of their religion and wants Pawan to be different. Pawan understands and runs into the Mosque to get Munni but by now, she has already left. As he nervously looks for her, she runs to him and hugs him tightly. At that moment, he accepts her entirely, overcoming his irrational fear of going against his religion.\nThat night is a cricket match against Pakistan and India. The entire family watches it on TV, cheering for India, except Munni who cheers when Pakistan scores. When the Pakistani team wins the game, she dances and kisses their flag on TV. Pawan approaches her and asks her if she is from Pakistan. After weeks of shaking her head to every Indian city, Munni finally nods yes. Pandey is furious. Being a Muslim was bad enough but since the girl is from Pakistan, he can no longer allow her to stay at their home. Pawan promises to hand her to the Pakistani embassy the next day. However, the embassy worker cannot allow her a visa without a passport. In Munni's case, they don't even know her real name so a visa allotment is impossible. Moreover, a riot takes place in front of the embassy that closes all visa processing for a month. As the last resort, Pawan takes her to a travel agent at Pandey's suggestion. The agent promises to take the little girl to the other side of the border and asks for one lakh rupees. Pawan and Rasika give up the funds they had collected for their house to help Munni. The next day, Pawan reluctantly brings Munni to the travel agent's office and leaves after a tearful farewell. On his way home, he notices a street vendor selling glittery bangles. He remembers that Munni liked them and buys one for her. However, on returning to the travel agent's office, he finds out that he has been cheated. The agent has taken the little girl to a brothel and is about to sell her into prostitution. The otherwise composed Pawan loses his temper at the sight of the agent counting bills that he made from Munni. He throws the man out of the window and brings Munni home again.\nPawan has made the decision to bring Munni home himself. Although he has no connections or ideas about Pakistani villages, he packs his bags and makes his way to the border.  A few miles away from it, they meet a secret agent named Ali who illegally transports people to the other side through a tunnel. After listening to Munni's story, he agrees to take them for free.  When they reach Pakistan's side of the border, Ali runs away but being a lord Hanuman's devotee, Pawan refuses to go without asking the guards for permission. When the officers find him, they beat him up as Munni watches and cries. Pawan pretends to laugh even while being beaten so the little girl wouldn't be afraid. After finding out the reason for his travel the head soldier asks him to do whatever he wants in the following ten minutes before they return for the next round. Pawan decides to wait for them because they have still not permitted him.  Although the idea is idiotic, and he gets beaten up again, he is eventually allowed to go, with permission from the soldiers.\nIn the following scene, he and Munni are in a restaurant. Munni sees a cop's handcuffs and steals it, assuming that it is a bracelet.  The cop finds out and throws Pawan in jail, labelling him as an Indian spy because of the lack of a passport. Then, we are introduced to a struggling journalist Chand Nawab. He finds out about the alleged spy and runs to the police station to interview him. He gets a few vague answers from Pawan and informs the media company that doesn't take him seriously. Inside the police station, a cop interrogates Pawan but refuses to believe anything he has to say. Suddenly, Munni sees a picture on a table calendar and recognises it as her village. Pawan is overjoyed until the policeman forcefully makes Munni open her mouth. Pawan loses his temper and attacks the man, inviting more trouble for himself. He manages to defeat the officers and run away from the police. Nawab sees him escaping and follows him behind.\nThey board the bus where Pawan shows the conductor their destination and also tells him Munni's story.  After finding out he is actually a good person, Nawab and the rest of the travellers decide to help him. They hide him and Munni on the top of the bus when the police come looking for them. At night, Nawab, Pawan, and Munni stay at a Mosque. A religious scholar named Azad also helps them and hides them from the policemen searching the entire city for the alleged spy. One of Azad's students sees \"Switzerland\" written on the picture that Munni thought was her village. The group is back to square one. After that, Azad dresses up Pawan and Nawab in a burqa and manages to send them outside the city without the police noticing. Pawan, who was oblivious to Islam a few weeks ago, feels strange in their traditional clothing. He apologises to his god but is ready to do anything for Munni. For the next few days, Pawan and Nawab take Munni to several different places, asking people if they know her. Nawab documents their journey and everything about Munni and Pawan's relationship. He tries selling the documentary to news channels, but they refuse to air it, claiming it is boring. They have to find another way to spread the news so, the people on the internet can help. One day, they go to a famous mosque where they find policemen looking for them. Nawab realises that his cameraman friend is being used by the police to gather information about their whereabouts. The trio immediately runs away from the holy place and gives the cameraman false information to distract the police.\nFollowing that, the group is reviewing the footage from their time at the mosque when Munni recognises her mother in one of the clips. They see her getting into a specific bus and go to the bus driver the very next day. On inquiring, he names all the villages that come to his daily route. One of them is Sultanpur which Munni confirms is her home. Nawab and Pawan hug, having finally found their destination. Nawab also uploads the video documentary on YouTube and the police get a hint of their location through it. On their way to Sultanpur, the bus is stopped to be checked. With no way out, Pawan comes to the police's view and pretends to run away. While the men are trying to catch him, Nawab takes Munni and brings her back to her village. In the following scene, we see Munni run to her mother, who couldn't be happier to see her. As she reunites with her family, Pawan gets beaten up by the police.\nThe documentary on YouTube goes viral and bigger news channels start covering the story. Eventually, people find out that Pawan is not a spy and is being held in prison for helping a little girl. Both Indian and Pakistani people give him all their support. But the Pakistani officials refuse to let him go. They torture him in prison, beating him up for hours, drowning him until his last breath, and starving him. Nawab then claps back with another video, this time on a bigger platform, asking people to gather at the border and ensure that Pawan reaches home safely. The plan works, and several people from both sides come to the border in crowds. Rasika and her family are also among the crowd, waiting for him to come home. Eventually, the officials have to back down. The crowd erupts chanting Pawan's name as he crosses the border. Then, we see Munni among the crowd, waving her hands but unable to call him. All of a sudden, she shouts \"Mama\", the name Pawan wanted her to call him when they first met. The crowd goes silent as she yells goodbye. Pawan turns around in shock. The movie ends as they run to each other and hug."

The film wins you over completely\". Srijana Mitra Das of Times of India gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, writing that \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan is Salman Khan's most daring film where Salman presents a beautiful performance - but allows the story to be the real \"dabangg\" \".Rachit Gupta for Filmfare wrote that \"If movies are meant to inspire, then Bajrangi Bhaijaan fulfills its purpose with resounding success\", giving the movie 3.5 out of 5 stars. Archita Kashyap of Koimoi gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, writing that \"watch (the film) for full-blown, larger than life, wholesome Hindi filmy entertainment\". Raja Sen of Rediff.com gave a 3.5 out of 5 star rating explaining that \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan is an overearnest, oversimplified, preposterously sweet and frequently schlocky film, which shouldn't work because of how predictable and soppy it is. Yet, because of a finely picked supporting cast, some sharp lines of dialogue and, most crucially, because of its overall heart, it works, and works well.\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave 3 stars out of 5, commenting \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan is way too long at 2 hours and 35 minutes, and could have done with some serious pruning, especially in its first half. Nevertheless, it's more engaging than such typical Salman Khan blockbusters as Bodyguard and Ready, if only because it has a sliver of a story, and its heart in the right place.\" Anupama Chopra of Hindustan Times said \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan is simplistic, occasionally silly, and tiringly over-stretched. It's also unashamedly manipulative. But it works. Director and co-writer Kabir Khan preserves the larger-than-life Salman image but also allows it to evolve so that the star is not just a slick superman.\" Uday Bhatia for Mint wrote: \"To say Bajrangi Bhaijaan is geared towards maximum emotional impact is an understatement. It is engineered for it. Its parts have been carefully assembled so as to make you laugh every other scene, tear up every 10 minutes\"; further praising Harshaali Malhotra, he goes \"Who says you need a girl and a gun to make a movie? This film proves that you only need the former, provided she's a criminally cute six-year-old\".Overseas too, the film received positive reviews from Chinese critics. Several critics in China, where it was released as Little Lolita's Monkey Uncle, noted narrative parallels to the 16th century Chinese epic Journey to the West and its monkey-king hero Sun Wukong (which in turn have similarities to the 4th century BC Hindu epic Ramayana and its monkey-god hero Hanuman), making the film relatable to Chinese audiences. The film's theme of connecting people across nations, religions and ethnicities also resonated with Chinese audiences. In Japan, upon release in January 2019, it was the week's highest-rated film on the Filmarks audience satisfaction survey."

He hires her to write a column, and when its blunt and gossipy nature increases its popularity, Sheilah also is offered her own radio program.\nShe meets acclaimed author F. Scott Fitzgerald at a party at the home of humorist Bob Carter, her friend. An immediate attraction is formed, although Scott is still married to wife Zelda, who has been institutionalized in a psychiatric hospital. To meet financial obligations, Scott has accepted a position in Hollywood writing film scripts, expressing the belief that his novels are no longer of interest.\nHis excessive drinking affects his mood and his work. Scott is haunted by the memories of Zelda and the success and fun they had together. He learns that a play is being produced in Pasadena based on one of his stories and takes Sheilah to see it, only to discover that it is a production by high school students, some of whom are unaware that the writer is even still alive.\nSheilah copes with his growing alcoholism and tries to leave him until Scott sends a goodbye note, sounding suicidal. She confesses to him that her own past haunts her, everything she claimed to be being a lie: Sheilah actually is a girl from the London slums. She appeals to Scott to write another book, but after he sends in the first four chapters, Scott receives a publisher's letter of rejection.\nSheilah's radio show is based in Chicago, and as she travels there, Scott becomes abusive, first aboard an airplane and then to one of her colleagues. What she doesn't know is that Scott has been fired by the studio, which finds his script work unacceptable. Sheilah continues to stand by him, but eventually Scott's health gives out. He collapses and dies, a forlorn figure of the past."

The film had originally pulled together several prominent names across Indian cinema as its principal cast and crew, including Vishnuvardhan, Amrish Puri and Naseeruddin Shah. The music for the film was composed by Ilaiyaraaja with cinematography handled by Ravi K.

Later classical violinist L.

One of the songs were sung by prominent M. S. Subbulakshmi, and another song was titled \"Poranthathu Panaiyur Mannu\" which was composed and sung by Ilaiyaraaja. At an award ceremony held in Chennai, both Kamal Haasan and Ilaiyaraaja sang few lines from this song, which prompted fans requesting to release the full song online.

Nandini rescues him, but in the process she loses her heart-shaped watch which she had just bought.\nWhile accompanying his mother to Madikeri in Coorg, Preetham confronts a man named Jaanu. Jaanu, who has been following Nandini, hits Preetham, thinking that he is in love with her. Preetham, unaware that Jaanu has vowed not to allow anyone near Nandini, fights Jaanu and his gang in revenge.\nIn Madikeri, Preetham unexpectedly meets Nandini. He identifies himself and expresses his love for her and offers to put her lost watch on her. Nandini, who is already engaged, rejects his request. Nonetheless, Preetham vows to marry Nandini if she meets him again. In the meantime, Preetham discovers that his nearly-deaf host in Madikeri, Col. Subbaiah, is Nandini's father and that her wedding is only a week away. Dejected, Preetham throws Nandini's watch away. But Nandini calls him and taunts him to return. Delighted, Preetham goes in search of her watch and spots a rabbit, which he names Devadas, and brings it along with the watch.\nSince Nandini's friends are due to arrive from Mumbai for the wedding, Preetham takes Nandini to the railway station. The train is delayed by five hours, so Nandini and Preetham decide to visit a nearby hill-temple. While returning from the temple, Preetham and Nandini are caught in the rain. An old couple offers to give them shelter inside their hut. Preetham, still not sure about expressing his love to Nandini, grabs a couple of toddy bottles, goes out in the rain and starts drinking. However, when Nandini walks towards him, offering an umbrella, he drunkenly tells Nandini that he should stay away from Nandini to remain a decent boy, rather than to propose or elope with her. Nandini is now in love with Preetham and is in a dilemma as her wedding is in a few days. She asks him to take her to the top of a waterfall where she expresses her love for him while standing at the edge.\nPreetam, intent on marrying Nandini, takes Col. Subbaiah for a morning jog to discuss the matter. But Col. Subbaiah, a heart patient, tells Preetham that he is expected to die anytime and his only desire is to get Nandini married to Gautam: an army officer who saved his life during a war. He also could feel Nandini's mother's worry when she realised that Nandini could be in love with someone else because the wedding was to happen the next day and all invitations were already sent out. Her mother also felt that it would be very unfair to a good person like Gautham. Hence, Preetham decides to obey Nandini's parents' wishes and let Gautham marry Nandini. The night before the wedding, an extremely depressed Preetham goes to a road-side bar to drink alcohol and sees Gautam arriving for his wedding ceremony. Gautam asks the bar-owner for directions to Col. Subbaiah's home because of the heavy rains and badly-maintained interior roads of Coorg. Jaanu arrives and tries to kill Gautam, Preetham saves him and convinces Jaanu that Gautam is the best person to marry Nandini.\nThe next day, Preetham brings Gautam to the wedding after Gautam's car broke down. They reach just in time for the ceremony, but Preetham declines to attend. Gautam asks for the heart-shaped watch as a memento but Preetham leaves, unwilling to part with it. They search for Preetham, but cannot find him. Only Preetham's mother knows the truth of his love for Nandini, and she tries to hide her fear.\nResignedly, Preetham watches the arch proclaiming \"Gautham weds Nandini\" and the marriage taking place in Kodava style. As he leaves, he spots Devadas and takes the rabbit with him. Driving towards Bangalore, Preetham confides in Devadas as to how much he loved Nandini, and how he wished he had a life with her. He then realises that Devadas has died. The film ends with Preetham burying Devadas."

Accidentally, Tamizhvanan comes to the area of Sengalvarayan's house, and lends his car to take Sengalvarayan's wife to the labour ward, but the delivery happens safely inside the car.\n1996: Sengalvarayan's son Pazhani secures the first rank in his 10th standard state exam, and visits Tamizhvanan, now the chairman of the party and a member of the ruling coalition, for his blessings with his father. While they are waiting in the party office for the leader to come in, they witness an accidental murder of a rebel in the party, by Tamizhvanan due to caste-related comments by the rebel on him. When Tamizhvanan asks Sengalvarayan to take the blame by saying that he killed the man due to rage about the rebel's comments, Pazhani volunteers to take the blame and is willing to go to prison, citing the leniency of juvenile laws in exchange for an MLA seat for his father in the upcoming by-elections.  Tamizhvanan accepts and Sengalvarayan later becomes an MLA.\n2015: Trainee IPS officers Mithran, Shakthi, Suraj, Kathiresan and Janardhan discreetly assist the police in catching a gang which kidnapped four girls. One day, Mithran receives a cryptic text message on his phone from an anonymous number stating that they are aware of their discreet activities. In the evening, they go out to meet that person who is revealed to be a forensic pathologist and Mithran's ex-girlfriend Mahima. Later that same night, they happen to witness the murder of a man named Ramar, who is a social activist with the pretence of snatch theft. Mithran and his friend catch the gang and their leader and hand them over to the police. 4 days later, the leader of the gang comes to the IPS headquarters with the Home minister.\nThis political and organised crime comes as a shock to Mithran and his friends. Mithran takes them to his house and shows his research on connecting all small unrelated incidents into the global view of a hidden crime network, who bend the law for their own financial benefits. He singles out three influential persons: pharmaceutical mogul Ashok Pandian, mineral magnate Charles Chelladurai and chieftain Perumal Swamy. When he tries following one, he realizes that all three of them work as a group, and they all work for a wealthy and influential scientist Siddharth Abhimanyu. After the completion of his training, Mithran is awarded medals for specializing in dealing with organized crime during training and also for being the best probationer of the batch, and is posted as the ASP of the Organized Crime Unit.\nMithran discovers that Siddharth is Sengalvarayan's son Pazhani. After his release from prison, Pazhani had his name changed and left India to complete his education abroad. After his graduation, he returned to India and is now a well-established scientist. Siddharth uses the medical field for the wrong reasons and for his own profit. Sengalvarayan is now the incumbent Health Minister in the minority government headed by Tamizhvanan, who is now the CM. At that time, Angelina, a Swiss pharmaceutical company owner and activist, tries to make generic medicines for life-threatening diseases available in India at low cost affordable by poor people. Siddharth's assassin kills Angelina before she can sign the agreement document with the government and shoots Mithran at the same time.\nWhile Mithran is recovering from the gunshot wound in the hospital, an electronic bug (GPS + audio transmitter) is implanted during surgery by Siddharth. Through the bug, Siddharth listens to all of Mithran's plans and continuously monitors his whereabouts and conversations via audio transmission. Then comes evidence against Siddharth in the form of Manimekalai. Manimekalai was a scientist at Siddharth's research lab, where a seaweed that can cure diabetes is found abundantly in the oceans. Siddharth tries to sell the technology and rights to extract medicine from the seaweed to multinational pharmaceutical companies, but is opposed by Manimekalai. So Siddharth hires goons and kill her. But before being killed, she records a video and stores it in an SD card so that someone will find it.\nBefore Mithran can find the card, Siddharth finds out and assigns Vicky, Perumal Swamy's brother, to recover the card, but Mithran tells Jana to get the card. He successfully gets the card after a fight with Vicky, but through the bug, Siddharth knows this and kills Jana. Mithran comes back to his special house where he finds a pin that has been changed in a picture which turns out to be the picture of Ananya, who was Miss World 2011 and a close acquaintance of Siddharth whose girlfriend Shilpa was also part of that event. Mithran doubts whether Siddharth himself would have come to his house. Mahima checks the fingerprints on the pin keeping the gun case Mithran received from Siddharth in his posting ceremony, and the fingerprints match. A flashback reveals that Siddharth killed Shilpa's father so that she would not participate in the competition, and as she will not have a ticket to go to her father's funeral, he offers to take her in his chartered flight and wins her over.\nMithran frantically searches for the bug, which he eventually finds and removes. Mithran captures Vicky and records all the information from him. He drugs Vicky and manipulates Siddharth into killing him. At the same time, Siddharth's father reads the changed medical report, which contains very good medical contracts for public welfare and multiple accusations against Tamizhvanan. When Siddharth learns about this, he asks Sengalvarayan to pretend to have chest pains and move outside to the hospital. The ruling party forces Sengalvarayan either to resign within 24 hours or he will be dismissed. Mithran appeals to Tamizhvanan that he has evidence and wants to arrest Siddharth, and he is granted permission to do so. Hence Siddarth kills Sengalvarayan using his goons in an accident and forces Tamizhvanan to stop actions against him, or he will lie that Tamizhvanan killed his father for personal vengeance. However, the next day at Sengalvarayan's state funeral, Mithran arrests him on Tamizhvanan's orders.\nWhen Siddharth is arrested, Mithran tells him that the medicine was patented in Manimekalai's name (despite Siddarth being the inventor) and will be made as generic medicine instead of a patent-protected one. It is also revealed that Sengalvarayan is still alive, saved by Mithran and his gang and the public funeral held was for Jana. Mithran makes a deal that he would save Siddharth's life for information and evidence on all of his criminal associates and activities and gives him a bulletproof vest to fake his death during his transport to the court. They also plan to take down the setup planned by various VIPs to kill Siddharth when one of them gets close to Siddharth, Mithran pushes him and learns that Siddharth did not wear the vest and is fatally shot by Shilpa. Before dying, Siddharth tells Mithran that he hid all the evidence in an SD card in the bulletproof vest, adding that he had not done it for the nation but because Mithran had asked for it. Siddharth's accomplices are arrested and the film ends with marriage of Mahima and Mithran."

The two were reunited after a difficult family circumstances.\nDescribed by Elliot Stein in The Village Voice as \"the classiest 'male weepie' ever filmed\", Family Diary is an exemplary adaptation of the semi-autobiographical Vasco Pratolini novel Two Brothers, and won Zurlini a shared Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.\nMarcello Mastroianni gives a sensitive, finely judged performance as Enrico, a struggling journalist in 1945 Rome.

He was raised by their poor but warm-hearted grandmother (Sylvie), while Lorenzo was raised as a gentleman by a wealthy local aristocrat. Reunited in the Florence of the 1930s, Enrico becomes his spoiled brother's keeper, forever haunted by a sense of guilt and responsibility towards a man he both hates and loves.\nBeautifully photographed by Giuseppe Rotunno, this austere, deeply felt masterwork has been acclaimed as one of Zurlini's greatest achievements."

As they travel home afterward, Sophie develops a craving for \"something sweet\" and stops their car at a convenience store. While Hugh is in the store buying some chocolate for Sophie, an armed man arrives and holds up the store, shooting the store clerk, his son, and Hugh dead. He runs away as Sophie arrives.\nSophie sinks into a deep depression, and cannot bring herself to erase Hugh's voice from their apartment's answering machine. She consults her psychiatrist, Dr. Fayn, about persistent headaches that she has been suffering from since his death. She tells Dr. Fayn that the headaches started to occur before the incident at the convenience store, and that she had been having an affair with a co-worker, Jesse. After Hugh's death Sophie has dinner with her mother, Carol Jacobs, who accidentally knocks a glass over.\nDuring a college photography class that she teaches, Sophie sets up a slide projector for the students to showcase their best photographs. One slide in the slide show depicts the exterior of the convenience store on the evening of November 7. Sophie contacts Officer Roberts, the head of the investigation into the shootings at the convenience store, who is as puzzled as she is as to who is responsible for the photos. Sophie's headaches continue, and she begins to hear strange noises coming from within her apartment building and mysterious voices on the phone. Later, Officer Roberts discovers that the photo of the convenience store was paid for with Sophie's credit card.\nThe film presents two more different versions of these events, and Sophie must figure out which is real before she loses grip on her sanity, and her life. The second version suggests that Sophie was present at the shootings and was only spared because the shooter ran out of bullets, and the third suggests both Sophie and Hugh were killed. In the words of Cox, her character \"goes through three phases. First there's denial. Then she feels guilty and sad about the situation. Then she has to learn to accept it.\" According to Greg Harrison, the events in the film were Sophie's memories as she and Hugh lay dying on the floor of the convenience store: \"Each movement of this memory was her process of coming to terms with the terrible trauma, which was that she was killed for absolutely no reason, and it was some random act of violence she couldn\u2019t confront\". He added he felt November was \"open-ended\" enough that he hoped viewers would \"come up with the most beautiful stories themselves that are very different from how I saw it.\""

        "content": "The film's script was written by Benjamin Brand, who had written and sold several unproduced screenplays to studios. Brand had served as an assistant to producer Danielle Renfrew on the film Groove (2000), which was directed by Greg Harrison. Brand, Renfrew and Harrison were friends and living in their hometown of San Francisco developing separate projects at \"Major film studios#Mini-majors\" studios which, according to Renfrew, were \"wallowing in development hell\". Brand saw a news story about a store robbery in which the robber had hidden the body of the cashier behind the counter and then impersonated the cashier as customers came in. Drawing from this story as well as from experiences in his own life (he had previously taught photography at the Academy of Art), Brand wrote a screenplay and presented it to Renfrew and Harrison. Both were impressed, and Harrison said it was \"fascinating ... kind of an abstract exercise in narrative, which I thought was exciting and bold\".Brand and Harrison worked through several drafts of the script over the following six months. Harrison, who cited the death of a close friend as one of his personal inspirations for the film, focused on inserting more emotional elements into the script; in his words they were \"trying to express the subjective experience of trauma\". Once a draft was completed, the group began pitching the project to various production companies. Renfrew consciously chose to avoid taking the project to major Hollywood studios such as 20th Century Fox or Warner Bros. and instead opted for \"smaller companies who were interested in doing something off of center\". A breakthrough was achieved after a meeting with director Gary Winick, who had established a company in New York City called InDigEnt. The company specialized in backing low-budget films shot on digital video such as Personal Velocity (2002), Tadpole (2002) and Pieces of April (2003). Greg Harrison's debut film Groove had impressed executives at the company, and John Sloss of Cinetic Media said, \"November is exactly the kind of sharp and invigorating material that has made InDigEnt what it is\".Before the development of the film, Harrison had cast actress Courteney Cox in a Garry Trudeau-scripted ensemble film being developed at Fox Searchlight. Cox was a comic actress widely known for her role on the television sitcom Friends and had participated in only a handful of more serious productions. While the Garry Trudeau project was intended as a comedy, Harrison said he felt Cox was \"very capable of drama and was very willing and wanted to transcend her comedic persona\". When the Trudeau project did not enter production, Harrison offered Cox the lead role for November without an audition: \"Courteney's biggest challenge is redefining herself ... I knew I could bring something out of her that people haven't seen before\", he said. Cox, who said she is more similar to her character in November than her Friends character, Monica Geller, said, \"I wanted to make November because it's fascinating, confusing, ambiguous, eerie and makes you think. There aren't that many movies where you leave the theater and want to talk about them\". She added, \"it was trying to take you through a woman's experience of tragedy and through all the stages. I loved that\"."

        "content": "Harrison, Brand and Renfrew intended the film to be set and shot in San Francisco, but problems arose with their proposal. Cox had a commitment to Friends, which was in production in Los Angeles, and the film's production costs did not allow the entire production team to relocate to northern California for the duration for the shoot. The filmmakers were forced to shoot in Los Angeles, but Renfrew later expressed no regret in their decision: \"We wanted the story to take place in an anonymous urban area. And I think we were successful in doing that\".Production finally began on May 19, 2003, and took place on Cox's days off from her Friends shooting schedule. Renfrew's Los Angeles home stood in for the apartment of Cox's character in the film. The budget did not allow the luxury of trailers, but with some persuading, neighbouring apartments were converted into staging areas. For her role Cox donned glasses with thick frames, and had her hair cut by seven inches and a grey streak dyed into it. Harrison said, \"She's seen in the fashion world as glamorous, a pop icon from Friends, so how to dress her down, and also make her body feel different. I had her wear those clothes around the house to feel like a different person\".\nThe film's cinematographer was Nancy Schreiber, who had never before shot a film on Mini-DV. Harrison intended the shifts between chapters of the film\u2014and Sophie's emotions\u2014to be signalled visually, and he instructed Schreiber to employ different colour casts accordingly. For the opening robbery scenes (which recur throughout the film), Schreiber purchased two Panasonic AG-DVX100 cameras with white balance and color temperature controls. She used them with lighting gels and sodium street lamps that surrounded the real-life convenience store where the crew was shooting to make the image appear green. A similar process was used in the second movement of the narrative, which was bathed in orange to represent Sophie's despair, while white expressed \"acceptance\" in the film's third and final act. To help achieve a blue colour cast for the first phase of the film (\"denial\"), Schreiber surrounded the shooting locations with machines that pumped smoke across the set. Cinematographer and Sundance Film Festival judge Frederick Elmes commented of Schreiber's work, \"She lit it and used colors in a way that the camera responded. And I don't think that's the kind of thing you do by accident. That's completely designed\".Harrison applauded the speed of Mini-DV for allowing such a short shoot: \"We could shoot with multiple cameras at times, which helped us in our schedule\". He also cited the advantages Mini-DV had in post-production, estimating that 75%\u201380% of the visual and sound design processing had been performed on desktop computers. November was shot in fifteen days on a budget of $150,000, and post-production costs were the same \u2013 a typical production model for films produced by InDiGent. Of the tight schedule and production costs, Harrison said, \"I don't recommend shooting a movie that way and I don't want to do it again to be honest. It's really, really taxing\".Once shooting had wrapped, Harrison entered the editing room and constructed the film over the course of eighteen weeks, occasionally consulting colleagues such as Sarah Flack (editor of The Limey and Lost In Translation). Harrison, who had started out in the film industry as an editor, noted the strong involvement of key creative personnel throughout the pre-production, production and post-production stages, and called it \"kind of a more holistic approach to post-production\". He described the experience of editing the film alone (for the most part) as \"brutal\" and \"exhausting\", but he said he was satisfied with his work nonetheless. When asked about the film's seventy-three-minute running time, Renfrew said that Harrison \"let the story and the film dictate the length as opposed to trying to force it to be any particular length\"."

The film\u2019s theatrical release date was moved to the following summer after Courteney Cox, who was then pregnant, gave birth to her first child. In the meantime, the film was screened outside the United States at the Oslo International Film Festival on November 20, 2004.On April 26, 2005, the film was screened at the San Francisco International Film Festival, whose organisers described it as an \"homage to the mindbending thrillers of David Lynch ... Inspired by the perception-versus-reality mindgames of Mulholland Drive and the eerie psychological aesthetic of Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now\". Audience response at its screening at the festival was generally positive, but critic Brandon Judell dismissed the film as \"highly irritating and nonsensical,\" while Joanne Bealy said it was \"a Mulholland Drive / David Lynch copycat ... even at 88 minutes, it was too long for me.\" The film screened at the Seattle International Film Festival on May 31, 2005 and the Los Angeles Film Festival on June 22, 2005."

Until they get their jobs, they go around places putting out fires and saving lives by themselves. Their actions are praised by everyone, including the zonal fire officer Narayanamoorthy, who promises them that they will get their jobs if they write and pass the exam that is needed for them to join the fire service.\nThe night before the exam, an injured Dhana meets his friends. He tells them that while he was coming back home after seeing his sister, he was stopped by a man named Sadha and his friend Soori. Sadha repeatedly assaults Dhana and tells Soori that he is a don and is unstoppable. When Sadha slaps Dhana, Dhana pushes him away and escapes. The five friends later go to the place where the incident happened in order to teach Sadha a lesson. To their shock, they see Sadha dead. It is revealed that when Dhana pushed Sadha, Sadha fell down, hit a rock, and succumbed to his injury. It is also revealed that he was the right-hand man of \"Puliyanthoppu\" Ravi, the city's most feared don.\nThe five friends seek help from MLA Kabali, the area counsellor and a well-wisher of Guru. Kabali tells them that Ravi will definitely come to them to avenge Sadha's death and that he cannot help them as Ravi is too powerful for him. Guru suggests that the friends finish off Ravi before he finds them, so the friends decide to kidnap him. The friends later visit Sadha's burial place, where all the dons from Chennai have assembled. Guru tells his friends that once Ravi goes away, they will kidnap him. At the site, Ravi asks Soori, who was drinking when the incident happened, only for him to not remember anything as he was drunk. Ravi then kills Soori in a fit of rage, and Guru is relieved since the only evidence against the friends is the dead Soori. However, Guru then gets a call from Samba and Parthi, who were hiding in another place. They tell him that they have kidnapped Ravi. Guru is very upset and explains to his friends what happened, telling them that they are back in trouble. As they discuss what to do next, Ravi manages to escape. He comes face-to-face with the friends and asks them for help. Apparently, he does not know who kidnapped him as he met with an accident and became unconscious, so the friends release him. However, Ravi is, in fact, keen on finding the man who kidnapped him and killed Sadha. Since he was kidnapped and hidden in the area of the friends, he enquires there and catches Kabali, who tells him everything. The five friends are tracked down by Ravi. Guru later engages in a fight with Ravi and his henchmen, where he defeats the henchmen but decides to spare Ravi. Guru tells Ravi that Sadha's death was an accident, but Ravi still has vengeance and threatens to kill Guru's loved ones.\nSome days later, Guru's father, Manikkam, is killed. Guru suspects that it was Ravi and decides to take revenge. However, upon reaching Ravi's place, he finds him and his henchmen dead. Commissioner Ramkumar reveals to Guru that Ravi was killed before Manikkam. Suddenly, Guru gets a call saying that his friends and girlfriend Vasumathi (Narayanamoorthy's daughter) have been kidnapped, and he must come to a location if he wants to see them alive. There, it is revealed that the person behind the murders is Annam, Sadha's transgender wife who has been trying to avenge his death. She approaches Ravi, but he refuses to help her, saying that Sadha's death was an accident and he will not kill Guru or his friends. Annam is angered by this and kills Ravi, his henchmen, and then Manikkam. Annam tells Guru that Sadha had loved her despite her being a transgender and, thinking that Guru shattered her life, decides to kill Vasumathi. However, Dhana escapes and manages to push Annam into a pyre, which was burning. Guru saves Vasumathi, his friends, and also Annam, stating that even if someone is an enemy, he will never let them get killed by fire. He also apologizes to Annam, saying that Sadha's death was an accident. Annam gets moved by his gesture and forgives him. Guru then leaves the place with his friends and girlfriend.\nLater, the five friends write the exam, succeed in passing it, join the fire service, and rush to a spot to save some people."

At the time, however, some western critics, including the New York Times, took the film at face value, seeing it as propagandist and describing it as a \"boot camp\" film.  The New York Times, in particular, derided the film as a \"Recruiting Poster for Collective Action.\" If critics felt that this was merely China's newest propaganda film, this was due in part to the heavy hand of the Chinese Film Bureau. Originally, Chen had not shot an actual parade to conclude his film, only obscure silhouettes of soldiers against a sunset, an artistic decision that shocked \"both army and censors.\" Even forcing the director to insert more traditional imagery, censors nevertheless withdrew the film from the 1987 Cannes Film Festival without explanation.Despite its apparent support of collectivism, some scholars have noted a more ambiguous subtext to the film, suggesting that the film's imagery is less simplistic than such early reviews suggested. As one scholar writes, Chen explores the relationship between the collective and the individual, but wants to leave the relationship ambiguous. Another Chinese film scholar, Zhang Yingjin, also sees a subtext of criticism of the Chinese notion of its own nationhood, even as the film's rhetoric veers towards the propagandist."

After Susan promises Kelly a third of her inheritance, Porter Hall, her sleazy financial advisor, discredits Kelly as a \"hippie\" to dissuade Susan from dividing the fortune he secretly wants to embezzle.\nUndeterred, Susan introduces the Kelly Affair to a flamboyant, well-connected rock producer, Ronnie \"Z-Man\" Barzell, who coaxes them into an impromptu performance at one of his outrageous parties (after a set by real-life band Strawberry Alarm Clock). The band is so well-received that Z-Man becomes their svengali manager, changing their name to the Carrie Nations and starting a long-simmering feud with Harris.\nKelly drifts away from Harris and dates Lance Rocke, a high-priced gigolo, who has his own designs on her inheritance. After losing Kelly, Harris is seduced by the sexually aggressive porn star Ashley St. Ives. She soon tires of his conventional nature and waning libido due to increasing drug and alcohol intake.

        "content": "Antz is a 1998 American animated adventure comedy film produced by DreamWorks Animation (as its debut film) and Pacific Data Images, and distributed by DreamWorks Pictures. It was directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson (in their feature directorial debuts) from a screenplay by Todd Alcott and the writing team of Chris and Paul Weitz. The film stars the voices of Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Jennifer Lopez, Sylvester Stallone, Christopher Walken, Dan Aykroyd, Anne Bancroft, Danny Glover and Gene Hackman. Some of the main characters share facial similarities with the actors who voice them. The film involves an anxious worker ant, Z (Allen), who falls in love with Princess Bala (Stone). When the treacherous scheming of the arrogant officer General Mandible (Hackman) threatens to wipe out the entire worker population, Z must save the ant colony from the flooded tunnel and strives to make social inroads.\nDevelopment began in 1988 when Walt Disney Feature Animation pitched a film called Army Ants, about a pacifist worker ant teaching lessons of independent thinking to his militaristic colony. Meanwhile, Jeffrey Katzenberg had left the company in a feud with CEO Michael Eisner over the vacant president position after the death of Frank Wells. Katzenberg would later go on to help co-found DreamWorks with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen, and the three planned to rival Disney with the company's new animation division. Production began in May 1996, after production had already commenced on The Prince of Egypt (1998). DreamWorks had contracted Pacific Data Images (PDI) in Palo Alto, California, to begin working on computer-animated films to rival Pixar's features. Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell composed the music for the film, marking their first animated film. During its production, a controversial public feud erupted between Jeffrey Katzenberg of DreamWorks and Steve Jobs and John Lasseter of Pixar, due to the production of their similar film A Bug's Life, which was released a month later. The feud worsened when Disney refused to avoid competition with DreamWorks' intended first animated release, The Prince of Egypt.\nAntz premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 19, 1998, and was released theatrically in the United States on October 2, 1998. It grossed $171.8 million worldwide on a budget of $42\u2013105 million and received positive reviews, with critics praising the voice cast, animation, humor, and its appeal towards adults."

While at the local bar one night, Z falls in love with the colony's princess Bala when she visits the bar to escape her suffocating royal life. Meanwhile, the ant colony declares war on an encroaching termite colony, and soldiers are sent to engage the invaders. To see Bala again, Z exchanges places with his soldier friend, Weaver, and joins the army, where he befriends staff sergeant Barbatus. The ants are unaware that General Mandible, the army's leader and Bala's fianc\u00e9, is secretly sending the soldiers loyal to the colony's Queen to die so he can stage a coup d'\u00e9tat. In the battle, everyone except Z is killed by much-larger acid-shooting termite defenders. Before dying, Barbatus tells Z to think for himself instead of blindly following orders. Meanwhile, Weaver joins the digging crew and falls in love with Z's co-worker, Azteca.\nZ returns home and is mistakenly hailed as a war hero. Secretly dissatisfied, Mandible congratulates him and introduces him to the Queen. There, Z meets Bala, who recognizes him as a worker. Z panics and pretends to take Bala hostage; he flees with Bala, but they end up falling out of the anthill via a garbage chute. Now a fugitive, Z decides to search for Insectopia, a legendary insect paradise. Bala attempts to return to the colony, but quickly rejoins Z after encountering a praying mantis.\nZ's act of individuality inspires the workers and some soldier ants, halting productivity. To gain control, Mandible publicly portrays Z as a self-centered war criminal, promotes the glory of conformity, and promises the workers rewards for completing a \"Mega Tunnel\" he designed. However, Mandible's second-in-command, a flying ant named Cutter, begins to doubt Mandible's constant reassurances that he's acting for the good of the colony.\nZ and Bala come upon a human picnic, which they mistake for Insectopia. They are baffled by the wrappings on the food, but Muffy and Chip, a married couple of liberal wasps, condescendingly befriend them and try to help break the wrappers. They are disrupted by the humans, who kill Muffy with a fly swatter and attempt to squish the ants with a shoe. Z rescues Bala from the sneaker, and the two ants at last find Insectopia, a trash can overfilled with decaying food.\nMeanwhile, after interrogating Weaver, Mandible learns that Z is looking for Insectopia and sends Cutter to find it. That night, whilst Z is away, Cutter arrives at Insectopia and forcibly flies Bala back to the colony, where Mandible reveals his intention to restart the colony with Bala as his Queen. Seeing Z's desperation at finding Bala gone, a drunken Chip, mourning over Muffy's death, generously flies Z back to the colony. When Z arrives, Mandible's soldiers forcibly direct him toward the Mega Tunnel. Along the way, he finds Bala held captive in Mandible's office. After he frees her, they both discover that Mandible's Mega Tunnel leads straight to the puddle next to Insectopia, which Mandible will use to drown the Queen and the workers at the opening ceremony. Bala warns the Queen while Z attempts to stop the workers in time, but fails. Z and Bala unify the Queen and workers into building a ladder towards the surface as the water rises.\nMeanwhile, Mandible gathers the soldiers on the surface and gloats he has created a new colony, where only the strong survive. When the worker ants break through the surface, Cutter betrays Mandible and rescues them. Enraged, Mandible attempts to tackle Cutter, but Z intervenes and takes the blow. He and Mandible fall back into the flooded tunnel, with Mandible striking a root and dying on impact. Z nearly drowns, but is rescued by Cutter and resuscitated by Bala. Z is praised for his heroism, and he and Bala become a couple. Together, they rebuild the colony, and Z narrates that he is finally content with his place in the world.

        "content": "In 1916, a young Jiro Horikoshi longs to become a pilot, but his nearsightedness prevents it. One night, he dreams of his idol, the Italian aircraft designer Giovanni Battista Caproni, who tells him that he has never flown a plane in his life, and that building planes is better than flying them. Seven years later after World War I ended, Jiro is traveling by train to study aeronautical engineering at Tokyo Imperial University and meets a young girl, Nahoko Satomi, traveling with her maid. When the Great Kant\u014d earthquake hits, Nahoko's maid's leg is broken and Jiro helps Nahoko carry her to Nahoko's family home, leaving without giving his name.\nIn 1925, Jiro graduates with his friend Kiro Honjo and both are employed at aircraft manufacturer Mitsubishi, assigned to design a fighter plane, the Mitsubishi 1MF9, for the Imperial Army. During a test, it breaks apart in midair and is rejected. Dispirited about what he perceives as the backwardness of Japanese aircraft technology, Jiro is sent with Honjo to the Weimar Republic in 1929 to carry out technical research and obtain a production license for a Junkers G.38 aircraft. Jiro dreams again of Caproni, who tells him that the world is better for the beauty of planes, even if humankind might put them to terrible purposes.\nIn early 1932, Jiro is promoted to chief designer for a fighter plane competition sponsored by the Imperial Navy, but his design, the Mitsubishi 1MF10, fails testing in 1933 and is rejected. Disappointed, he goes to a summer resort in Karuizawa to rest, where he meets Nahoko again. Hans Castorp, a German visitor privately critical of the Nazi regime, tells Jiro, who intends to visit Dessau, that Hugo Junkers is in trouble for fighting Nazism and that Germany will go to war again and must be stopped.\nLater, Jiro asks Nahoko's father for his blessing to marry her, and the two are engaged. However, Nahoko has tuberculosis and wants to wait until she recovers to marry. Castorp assists in the romance before fleeing arrest by the Japanese secret police. Wanted in connection with Castorp, Jiro hides at his supervisor's home while he works on a new fighter aircraft project for the Imperial Navy. Following a lung hemorrhage, Nahoko recovers in a mountain sanatorium but cannot bear being apart from Jiro and returns to marry him. Jiro's sister Kayo, a doctor, warns Jiro that his marriage to Nahoko will end tragically as tuberculosis is incurable. Though Nahoko's health deteriorates, she and Jiro enjoy their time together.\nJiro leaves for the test flight of his new prototype aircraft, the Mitsubishi A5M. Knowing that she will die soon, Nahoko returns to the sanatorium, leaving farewell letters for Jiro, her family, and friends. At the test site, Jiro is distracted from his success by a gust of wind, suggesting Nahoko's passing. In 1945, after Japan lost World War II, Jiro dreams of Caproni again, regretting that his aircraft was used for war. Caproni comforts him, saying that Jiro's dream of building beautiful aircraft was nonetheless realized. Nahoko appears, encouraging her husband to live his life to the fullest. Jiro and Caproni walk together into their shared kingdom of dreams."

The film was screened at over thirty international film festivals, mainly those with an LGBT theme, winning awards including best film. It is considered a cult film in many circles,  becoming a classic in underground Gay Cinema after many screenings around the world.Toto Forever is a fable in which feelings and emotions are always fully exposed, with a very poetic and symbolic narrative, and an aesthetic strongly influenced by the Yaoi (\"Boys Love\") Japanese anime. The film tells the love story of Toto, a hopeful young postman who dreams of starting a new life, and Mark, a gangster, who is in deep trouble with a mafia group.\nThe film premiered at the 2010 Kashish Mumbai International Film Festival, the first LGBT festival in India organised after a Delhi High Court ruling decriminalised homosexual intercourse between consenting adults. Toto Forever was at the opening ceremony, and was the first film screened at the event. Canuto was also invited to screen the film at the opening ceremonies in Panama at the 3rd LesGayCinePTY, the most important gay film event in the country, where it won the best film award. At the South Asian premiere, at Indonesia's Q! Film Festival in Jakarta, there were serious incidents at some of the screenings when radical Muslim demonstrators from the Islamic Defenders Front, and groups of extremists from the Indonesian University, attended the venue with weapons and threatened to set fire to the theatre if the film was screened. Toto Forever was screened in many other venues around the world, receiving other accolades like the nomination for best cinematography at the 2009 Kodak Scholarship awards in the United States."

Canuto, shot the film as a graduation project at the New York Film Academy (NYFA) at  Universal Studios in Hollywood, but he finished the post-production work after graduation, including adding music by Andrea Centazzo. The film was the first collaboration between the director and the composer, one which was repeated in their next films together - Desire Street and Ni Jing: Thou Shalt Not Steal. Due to limitations in the production process, various scenes in the script were shortened. Of the film's length, the director commented: \"Of course, the whole story need to be tell with more depth and time (sic), but we reserve the full development of the plot for the feature script. Here we concentrate on feelings and emotion. For that reason I wanted to develop a plot that displayed a wide range of emotions in a short period of time.\" Regarding this, the critic Michael D. Klemm notes: \"A short film can be like a sketch for a painting and this one begins, appropriately, with rough drawings of the two leads. The emphasis here, undoubtedly, is what the young postman would remember from his abrupt adventure.\nThe main idea behind the characters is based on cartoon figures from the Japanese yaoi. In the opening and closing credits the film uses sketches that represent the characters of Toto and Mark, bringing an added dimension to the story. Susan Opperman, a South African artist with an MFA in fine arts, created the images, following her own vision of the story.\nThe film was shot in 16mm Kodak film and the principal photography took place in the summer of 2008 in California. Some of the locations were Mulholland Drive, Burbank, California, as well as some isolated roads outside Los Angeles. The post-production was completed in 2010.\nXu Xiaoxi, Roberto F. Canuto's collaborator in the directing (Desire Street and Ni Jing: Thou Shalt Not Steal), was director of photography on Toto Forever. The kissing scene between the characters is a key element of the film. According to the Canuto: \"I wanted to create a montage for the kissing scene. In order to do so, we decided to break standard time and space in order to create a special tempo that surprises the viewer and suspends the reality of the experience. The kissing scene was difficult to film due to the position of movement in such a tight space. This was key to delivering the right feel and emotion.  Kylan and Kjord deliver a moving and touching scene that is also the zenith of the whole story.\"The main theme of Toto Forever is hope. According to the director, he wanted to: \"recreate the moment when the human spirit recovers after a deep tragedy and rediscovers a new faith about life. Emily Dickinson's poem \"Hope\" was an inspiration for this film. While she faced the tragedy, it was with this painful moments when she has to allowed herself to find \"hope\" and move on.\nAs of July 2014, Toto Forever was still being screened at international festivals."

The moments that Toto and Mark get to share are very romantic and sensual...Canuto has a nice eye for the image and effectively exploits the language of close-ups.

Klemm at Cinemaqueer.com, 2009 (United States).\n\"...Every detail has significance as they subliminally add substance to an otherwise naive narrative. This collaboration is like a marriage of interpretation between the script and the art of cinema: combining the construct of the director with the skill of the cinematographer... The angle of photography requires of us to re-examine and not view things is a conventional way. Backward glances are shown through rear view mirror techniques and distorted reflections off a champagne bowl question the reason and nature of what might be obvious.

Gombo desires sexual intercourse with his wife, which puts his wife ill at ease: having a fourth child would break Chinese law. Meanwhile, Sergei, a buffoonish Russian truck driver falling asleep at the wheel, stops after a close call and attempts to awaken himself. His stretching turns to frolicking, and he wanders off. He discovers a corpse and quickly returns to his truck, accidentally driving into the river in his haste. Back at the yurt, the family is portrayed as unsophisticated and traditional people. They work together performing simple tasks like weaving by hand and using a horse cart to work leather. Gombo's drunk, horse-riding relative rides through the scene, stopping along the way to give them a movie poster for Cobra, which displays a muscular, gun-toting Sylvester Stallone.\nShortly after, Sergei is rescued by Gombo and taken to his family's yurt. Gombo's young son is stunned by the tattoos on Sergei's back, which include music notes. A comedic scene unfolds as Gombo, together with his family, goes about the usual and tidy work of slaughtering and cooking a sheep, much to Sergei's horror. We continue to be entertained as Sergei courageously consumes sheep and sheep broth. At some point, we find out that the carrion birds were not eating a human corpse. Gombo shows off the movie poster. Gombo's young daughter plays the accordion while Sergei takes on a distant look as he remembers fighting in the war. The next morning, Gombo's drunk, horse-riding relative rides by, stopping to give Gombo and his wife an apple and a hard-boiled egg.\nGombo and Sergei go into the nearest city together, where Gombo is supposed to buy condoms; instead, he chooses to wander the town. Elsewhere, Sergei spends time with his girlfriend, and they have sex. Gombo's drunk, horse-riding relative rides through the hallway outside their room, stopping to peek above the door and chuckle. He gives an apple to the woman's son, who is stranded in the hallway until the couple finishes. Later, Gombo, Sergei, and a friend meet at a nightclub. Sergei, a former army bandsman, becomes drunk and convinces the band to play the song from his tattoos, \"On the Hills of Manchuria,\" while he sings along. He is arrested and bailed out of jail by Gombo's uncle who lives in the city.\nGombo returns home, and along the way, stops to eat. We see that he has bought a bicycle and a TV. He falls asleep and has a strange dream featuring his drunk, horseback-riding relative as Genghis Khan and his wife as the Khan's wife. The Khan flies a black flag with a white eagle. In the dream, both he and Sergei are captured and killed, while the TV set is destroyed.\nGombo awakes from his dream and arrives home with the TV and other items. The family members interact with the new objects in stereotypical ways: Gombo gives his mother bubble-wrap from the packaging, and she proceeds to pop one single bubble at a time; his daughter plays with the bell on the bicycle, and his son pops out of the box the TV arrived in. Gumbo ignores his wife, so she remains sitting and kneading dough in preparation for dinner. Gombo, together with his children, sets up the TV and a small wind turbine.\nHe and his family switch between watching a news broadcast, the presidents of the US and Russia officially agreeing to peaceful interaction, and a badly sung variety show. The TV sits under the movie poster. Gombo's wife, saddened when learning that he bought no condoms, leaves the yurt. We then see her on the TV, and she invites her husband to follow her with a gesture. Gombo follows and leaves the yurt, appears on the TV, and follows her out onto the steppes, sticking an urga (a long stick with a lasso on the end used to capture animals) into the ground in a traditional signal that a couple is being intimate. There are shots of the happy family members and Sergei. The scene returns to the urga, and a voiceover from Gombo's fourth son, who was conceived at this time, concludes the film. The urga is replaced by an industrial chimney belching smoke."

        "content": "The director (John Malkovich) is flying to Italy following the conclusion of his latest film. On the airplane, as he looks out beyond the clouds, he begins to think about his next film and the art of filmmaking. Upon landing, he drives through the night through thick fog, with people appearing and disappearing like apparitions.\n\nStory of a Love Affair that Never ExistedIn Ferrara, Italy, Silvano (Kim Rossi Stuart) meets Carmen (In\u00e9s Sastre) and asks her where he can find a room for the night. She directs him to a hotel where she is staying. After checking in, Silvano sees her in the hotel restaurant and joins her. Silvano learns that Carmen is a teacher. They are attracted to each other, but they retire to their separate rooms. She undresses and waits for him, but he never comes. The next morning, he finds that she has checked out of the hotel.\nTwo years later in a movie theater in Ferrara, Silvano sees Carmen again and later approaches her outside. As they walk past the Castello Estense, she speaks of words that need to be spoken, but he says the only words worth speaking are hidden inside. Silvano walks Carmen to her home, where she reveals that she lived with a man for a year, and only recently he left her. \"Words do us good,\" she tells Silvano, \"even in writing. A woman expects them. She always does.\" Although seemingly attracted to Silvano, Carmen rebuffs his attempted kiss, and he leaves. Later he returns to her room, they undress, and he passes his hand over her skin as if unable to touch her. They move to passionately kiss, but they do not. Finally, he leaves without making love to her. Out in the street, he looks back at her watching from a window.\n\nThe Girl, The Crime ...The director visits a deserted beach on a dreary day. The wind sweeps the sand across the beach. He finds an old photograph of a seaside town cradled on a hillside. In Portofino, Italy, while exploring the quaint passageways above town, the director encounters a beautiful woman (Sophie Marceau) and follows her to a seaside clothing shop where the woman works. In the shop, she gives him a look of recognition. They do not speak, but seem drawn to each other. As the director leaves, she gestures to him but he does not respond.\nSome time later, the woman meets her friend at the Caff\u00e8 Excelsior, but notices the director sitting nearby. She approaches him and confesses, \"I killed my father. I stabbed him twelve times,\" and then walks away. The director follows and they talk about the killing that took place a year prior, for which she spent three months in jail before being acquitted. She takes him to the \"scene of the crime\" at the waterfront. Conflicted by her feelings for the director, she says, \"You remind me of somebody.\" They walk to her apartment and make love. Later, the director sits at a pool above the town contemplating the woman's story and its impact on the film he is writing.\n\nDon't Try to Find MeIn a Paris caf\u00e9, a young woman (Chiara Caselli) approaches a man (Peter Weller) sitting by himself. She wants to talk with someone about a magazine article she just read. The man is enchanted by the young woman's story. Three years later, the man returns home after seeing the young woman, who is by now his mistress. His wife, Patricia (Fanny Ardant), confronts her husband with an ultimatum: he must choose between them. When he goes to break up with his mistress, they end up making love. He returns home to find his wife drunk. \"Everything seems ridiculous,\" she tells him. He assures her that he will leave his mistress, and they make love for the first time in three years. The husband returns to his mistress who becomes jealous when she learns that he slept with his wife. They fight, but again they end up making love.\nMeanwhile, Carlo (Jean Reno) returns to his high-rise apartment to find it empty. He gets a phone call from his wife who has just emptied the apartment of most of their belongings and left him. After a brief angry exchange she hangs up on him. Looking around the apartment he sees a picture of his wife naked that she had ripped up before leaving. Patricia arrives at the apartment which she has just rented from Carlo's wife. Patricia has just left her husband and is expecting their furniture to arrive shortly\u2014she too has emptied her husband's home. Carlo reveals that his wife left him for her lover because he was away too often on business. Patricia then gets a phone call from her husband, and she tells him, \"Don't try to find me.\" Carlo and Patricia approach each other and he says, \"There's a cure for everything.\" Patricia responds, \"That's what disturbs me.\" He kisses her hand gently.\nIn the French countryside, a man pulls a woman from the railroad tracks as a train passes. On the train the director considers the \"limits of our brains, of our experience, of our culture, of our inspiration, of our imagination, of our sensitivity.\" A woman enters his compartment, gets a phone call, and says, \"Don't call me again.\" Meanwhile, on a nearby hill, an artist (Marcello Mastroianni) is painting the very landscape the train is passing through. He explains to a woman the value of copying from the masters.\n\nThis Body of FilthIn Aix-en-Provence, the director is contemplating the paintings in his hotel lobby when he notices a man entering the building across the street to deliver architectural drawings. When he reemerges, the man, Niccolo (Vincent Perez), passes a young woman (Ir\u00e8ne Jacob) in the doorway and decides to follow her. He asks if he can accompany her, and she tells him she's going to church. Niccolo is surprised that this quiet woman has little to say and seems uninterested in the world around her. She tells him that to be happy we need to eliminated pointless thoughts \u2014 that she prefers the quiet.\nAs they walk along the cobblestone streets, the young woman tells Niccolo that she longs to escape her body, that it needs too much and is never satisfied. Niccolo seems more interested in her body. When she does not respond to his romantic approaches, he observes that she looks like someone who is in love, like someone who is satisfied. She acknowledges that she is. When they arrive at the Church of Saint-Jean-de-Malte, the young woman enters the church, and he follows her inside. During the service, the young woman appears deeply spiritual as the choir sings. Detached and bored, Niccolo walks around like a tourist gazing up at the architecture before sitting down away from the congregation.\nLater Niccolo wakes up in the now empty church following the service. He runs out into the dark streets looking for the young woman, finding her at a well. They talk about the impermanence of things. He admits that he is scared of death, and she tells him she is scared of life \u2014 the life people lead. Niccolo accompanies the young woman home, stopping in an entrance to escape the rain. Asked what would happen if he fell in love with her, she responds, \"You'd be lighting a candle in a room full of light.\" When they reach her apartment, he asks to see her the next day. She replies simply, \"Tomorrow I enter a convent.\" Niccolo walks out into the night and the rain."
