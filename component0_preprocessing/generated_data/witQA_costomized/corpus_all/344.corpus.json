November was the ninth month of the calendar of Romulus . November retained its name (from the Latin novem meaning \"nine\") when January and February were added to the Roman calendar. November is a month of late spring in the Southern Hemisphere and late autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, November in the Southern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent of May in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa. In Ancient Rome, Ludi Plebeii was held from November 4\u201317, Epulum Jovis was held on November 13 and Brumalia celebrations began on November 24. These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar. November was referred to as Bl\u014dtm\u014dna\u00fe by the Anglo-Saxons. Brumaire and Frimaire were the months on which November fell in the French Republican calendar."

Thus, the flood was no ordinary overflow but a reversal of Creation. The narrative discusses the evil of mankind that moved God to destroy the world by the way of the flood, the preparation of the ark for certain animals, Noah, and his family, and God's guarantee (the Noahic Covenant) for the continued existence of life under the promise that he would never send another flood."

As a pledge of this gracious covenant with man and beast the rainbow was set in the clouds (ib. viii. 15-22, ix. 8-17). Two injunctions were laid upon Noah: While the eating of animal food was permitted, abstinence from blood was strictly enjoined; and the shedding of the blood of man by man was made a crime punishable by death at the hands of man (ib. ix. 3-6). Noah died 350 years after the flood, at the age of 950, the last of the extremely long-lived Antediluvian patriarchs. The maximum human lifespan, as depicted by the Bible, gradually diminishes thereafter, from almost 1,000 years to the 120 years of Moses."

        "content": "After the flood, the Bible says that Noah became a farmer and he planted a vineyard. He drank wine made from this vineyard, and got drunk; and lay \"uncovered\" within his tent. Noah's son Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father naked and told his brothers, which led to Ham's son Canaan being cursed by Noah. As early as the Classical era, commentators on Genesis 9:20\u201321 have excused Noah's excessive drinking because he was considered to be the first wine drinker; the first person to discover the effects of wine. John Chrysostom, Archbishop of Constantinople, and a Church Father, wrote in the 4th century that Noah's behavior is defensible: as the first human to taste wine, he would not know its effects: \"Through ignorance and inexperience of the proper amount to drink, fell into a drunken stupor\". Philo, a Hellenistic Jewish philosopher, also excused Noah by noting that one can drink in two different manners: (1) to drink wine in excess, a peculiar sin to the vicious evil man or (2) to partake of wine as the wise man, Noah being the latter. In Jewish tradition and rabbinic literature on Noah, rabbis blame Satan for the intoxicating properties of the wine. In the context of Noah's drunkenness, relates two facts: (1) Noah became drunken and \"he was uncovered within his tent\", and (2) Ham \"saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without\". Because of its brevity and textual inconsistencies, it has been suggested that this narrative is a \"splinter from a more substantial tale\". A fuller account would explain what exactly Ham had done to his father, or why Noah directed a curse at Canaan for Ham's misdeed, or how Noah came to know what occurred. In the field of psychological biblical criticism, J. H. Ellens and W. G. Rollins have analysed the unconventional behavior that occurs between Noah and Ham as revolving around sexuality and the exposure of genitalia as compared with other Hebrew Bible texts, such as Habakkuk 2:15 and Lamentations 4:21. Other commentaries mention that \"uncovering someone's nakedness\" could mean having sexual intercourse with that person or that person's spouse, as quoted in Leviticus 18:7-8 and 20. From this interpretation, it can be deduced that Ham was guilty of engaging in incest and raping Noah or his own mother. The latter interpretation would make clear why Canaan, as the product of this illicit union, was cursed by Noah. Alternatively, Canaan could be the perpetrator himself as the Bible describes the illicit deed being committed by Noah's \"youngest son\", with Ham being consistently described as the middle son in other verses."

(10:6\u201310) From there Ashur went and built Nineveh. (10:11\u201312) Canaan's descendants Sidon, Heth, the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites spread out from Sidon as far as Gerar, near Gaza, and as far as Sodom and Gomorrah.

Two of these, the Jahwist, composed in the 10th century BC, and the Priestly source, from the late 7th century BC, make up the chapters of Genesis which concern Noah. The attempt by the 5th-century editor to accommodate two independent and sometimes conflicting sources accounts for the confusion over such matters as how many of each animal Noah took, and how long the flood lasted. The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Books of the Bible notes that this story echoes parts of the Garden of Eden story: Noah is the first vintner, while Adam is the first farmer; both have problems with their produce; both stories involve nakedness; and both involve a division between brothers leading to a curse. However, after the flood, the stories differ. Noah plants the vineyard and utters the curse, not God, so \"God is less involved\"."

        "content": "The Noah story of the Pentateuch is almost identical to a flood story contained in the Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh, composed c. 1800 BCE.  In the Gilgamesh version, the Mesopotamian gods decide to send a great flood to destroy mankind. Various correlations between the stories of Noah and Gilgamesh (the flood, the construction of the ark, the salvation of animals, and the release of birds following the flood) have led to this story being seen as the inspiration for the story of Noah. The few variations include the number of days of the deluge, the order of the birds, and the name of the mountain on which the ark rests. The flood story in Genesis 6\u20138 matches the Gilgamesh flood myth so closely that \"few doubt that [it] derives from a Mesopotamian account.\" What is particularly noticeable is the way the Genesis flood story follows the Gilgamesh flood tale \"point by point and in the same order\", even when the story permits other alternatives. The earliest written flood myth is found in the Mesopotamian Epic of Atrahasis and Epic of Gilgamesh texts. The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica says \"These mythologies are the source of such features of the biblical Flood story as the building and provisioning of the ark, its flotation, and the subsidence of the waters, as well as the part played by the human protagonist.\" The Encyclopedia Judaica adds that there is a strong suggestion that \"an intermediate agent was active. The people most likely to have fulfilled this role are the Hurrians, whose territory included the city of Harran, where the Patriarch Abraham had his roots. The Hurrians inherited the Flood story from Babylonia\". The encyclopedia mentions another similarity between the stories: Noah is the tenth patriarch and Berossus notes that \"the hero of the great flood was Babylonia\u2019s tenth antediluvian king.\" However, there is a discrepancy in the ages of the heroes. For the Mesopotamian antecedents, \"the reigns of the antediluvian kings range from 18,600 to nearly 65,000 years.\" In the Bible, the lifespans \"fall far short of the briefest reign mentioned in the related Mesopotamian texts.\" Also, the name of the hero differs between the traditions: \"The earliest Mesopotamian flood account, written in the Sumerian language, calls the deluge hero Ziusudra.\" However, Yi Samuel Chen writes that the oldest versions of the Epic of Gilgamesh never mentioned the flood, just mentioning that he went to talk to Utnapishtim to find the secret of immortality. Starting with the Old Babylonian Period, there were attempts to syncretize Utnapishtim with Ziusudra, even though they were previously seen as different figures. Gilgamesh meeting the flood hero was first alluded to in the Old Babylonian Period in \"The Death of Bilgamesh\" and eventually was imported and standardized in the Epic of Gilgamesh probably in the Middle Babylonian Period. Gilgamesh\u2019s historical reign is believed to have been approximately 2700 BC, shortly before the earliest known written stories. The discovery of artifacts associated with Aga and Enmebaragesi of Kish, two other kings named in the stories, has lent credibility to the historical existence of Gilgamesh. The earliest Sumerian Gilgamesh poems date from as early as the Third dynasty of Ur (2100\u20132000 BC). One of these poems mentions Gilgamesh\u2019s journey to meet the flood hero, as well as a short version of the flood story, although Chen writes that his was included in texts written during the Old Babylonian Period. The earliest Akkadian versions of the unified epic are dated to ca. 2000\u20131500 BC. Due to the fragmentary nature of these Old Babylonian versions, it is unclear whether they included an expanded account of the flood myth; although one fragment definitely includes the story of Gilgamesh\u2019s journey to meet Utnapishtim. The \"standard\" Akkadian version included a long version of the flood story and was edited by Sin-liqe-unninni sometime between 1300 and 1000 BC. Yi Samuel Chen analyzes various texts from the Early Dynastic III Period through to the Old Babylonian Period, and argues that the flood narrative was only added in texts written during the Old Babylonian Period. When it comes to the Sumerian King List, observations by experts have always indicated that the portion of the Sumerian King List talking about before the flood is stylistically different from the King List Proper. Essentially Old Babylonian copies tend to represent a tradition of before the flood apart from the actual King List, whereas the Ur III copy of the King List and the duplicate from the Brockmon collection indicate that the King List Proper once existed independent of mention to the flood and the tradition of before the flood. Essentially, Chen gives evidence to prove that the section of before the flood and references to the flood in the Sumerian King List were all later additions added in during the Old Babylonian Period, as the Sumerian King List went through updates and edits. The Flood as a watershed in early History of the world was probably a new historiographical concept emerging in the Mesopotamian literary traditions during the Old Babylonian Period, as evident by the fact that the flood motif didn't show up in the Ur III copy and that earliest chronographical sources related to the flood show up in the Old Babylonian Period. Chen concludes that the name of Ziusudra as a flood hero and the idea of the flood hinted by that name in the Old Babylonian Version of \"Instructions of Shuruppak\" are only developments during that Old Babylonian Period, when also the didactic text was updated with information from the burgeoning Antediluvian Tradition"

Deucalion also sends a pigeon to find out about the situation of the world and the bird returns with an olive branch. Deucalion, in some versions of the myth, also becomes the inventor of wine, like Noah. Philo and Justin equate Deucalion with Noah, and Josephus used the story of Deucalion as evidence that the flood actually occurred and that, therefore, Noah existed. The motif of a weather deity who headed the pantheon causing the great flood and then the trickster who created men from clay saving man is also present in Sumerian Mythology, as Enlil, instead of Zeus, causes the flood, and Enki, rather than Prometheus, saves man. Stephanie West has written that this is perhaps due to the Greeks Borrowing stories from the Near East."

In the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke, Jesus compares Noah's flood with the coming Day of Judgement: \"Just as it was in the days of Noah, so too it will be in the days of the coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.\" The First Epistle of Peter compares the power of baptism with the Ark saving those who were in it. In later Christian thought, the Ark came to be compared to the Church: salvation was to be found only within Christ and his Lordship, as in Noah's time it had been found only within the Ark. St Augustine of Hippo (354\u2013430), demonstrated in The City of God that the dimensions of the Ark corresponded to the dimensions of the human body, which corresponds to the body of Christ; the equation of Ark and Church is still found in the Anglican rite of baptism, which asks God, \"who of thy great mercy didst save Noah,\" to receive into the Church the infant about to be baptised. In medieval Christianity, Noah's three sons were generally considered as the founders of the populations of the three known continents, Japheth/Europe, Shem/Asia, and Ham/Africa, although a rarer variation held that they represented the three classes of medieval society \u2013 the priests (Shem), the warriors (Japheth), and the peasants (Ham). In medieval Christian thought, Ham was considered to be the ancestor of the people of black Africa. So, in racialist arguments, the curse of Ham became a justification for the slavery of the black races. Isaac Newton, in his religious works on the development of religion, wrote about Noah and his offspring. In Newton's view, while Noah was a monotheist, the gods of pagan antiquity are identified with Noah and his descendants."

The Quran contains 43 references to Noah, or Nu\u1e25, in 28 chapters, and the seventy-first chapter, S\u016brah N\u016b\u1e25 (), is named after him. His life is also spoken of in the commentaries and in Islamic legends. Noah's narratives largely cover his preaching as well the story of the Deluge. Noah's narrative sets the prototype for many of the subsequent prophetic stories, which begin with the prophet warning his people and then the community rejecting the message and facing a punishment. Noah has several titles in Islam, based primarily on praise for him in the Quran, including \"True Messenger of God\" (XXVI: 107) and \"Grateful Servant of God\" (XVII: 3). The Quran focuses on several instances from Noah's life more than others, and one of the most significant events is the Flood. God makes a covenant with Noah just as he did with Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad later on (33:7). Noah is later reviled by his people and reproached by them for being a mere human messenger and not an angel (10:72\u201374). Moreover, the people mock Noah's words and call him a liar (7:62), and they even suggest that Noah is possessed by a devil when the prophet ceases to preach (54:9). Only the lowest in the community join Noah in believing in God's message (11:29), and Noah's narrative further describes him preaching both in private and public. The Quran narrates that Noah received a revelation to build an Ark, after his people refused to believe in his message and hear the warning. The narrative goes on to describe that waters poured forth from the Heavens, destroying all the sinners. Even one of his sons disbelieved him, stayed behind, and was drowned. After the Flood ended, the Ark rested atop Mount Judi (). Also, Islamic beliefs deny the idea of Noah being the first person to drink wine and experience the aftereffects of doing so. states that Noah had been living among the people who he was sent to for 950 years when the flood started. According to the Ahmadiyya understanding of the Quran, the period described in the Quran is the age of his dispensation, which extended until the time of Ibrahim (Abraham, 950 years). The first 50 years were the years of spiritual progress, which were followed by 900 years of spiritual deterioration of the people of Noah."

The description of Noah as \"righteous in his generation\" implied to some that his perfection was only relative: In his generation of wicked people, he could be considered righteous, but in the generation of a tzadik like Abraham, he would not be considered so righteous. They point out that Noah did not pray to God on behalf of those about to be destroyed, as Abraham prayed for the wicked of Sodom and Gomorrah. In fact, Noah is never seen to speak; he simply listens to God and acts on his orders. This led some commentators to offer the figure of Noah as \"the righteous man in a fur coat,\" who ensured his own comfort while ignoring his neighbour. Others, such as the medieval commentator Rashi, held on the contrary that the building of the Ark was stretched over 120 years, deliberately in order to give sinners time to repent. Rashi interprets his father's statement of the naming of Noah (in Hebrew \u2013 Noa\u0127 \u05e0\u05b9\u05d7\u05b7) \"This one will comfort us (in Hebrew\u2013 yeNa\u0126amenu \u05d9\u05b0\u05e0\u05b7\u05d7\u05b2\u05de\u05b5\u05e0\u05d5) in our work and in the toil of our hands, which come from the ground that the Lord had cursed\", by saying Noah heralded a new era of prosperity, when there was easing (in Hebrew \u2013 na\u0127ah \u2013 \u05e0\u05d7\u05d4) from the curse from the time of Adam when the Earth produced thorns and thistles even where men sowed wheat and that Noah then introduced the plow. According to the Jewish Encyclopedia, \"The Book of Genesis contains two accounts of Noah.\" In the first, Noah is the hero of the flood, and in the second, he is the father of mankind and a husbandman who planted the first vineyard. \"The disparity of character between these two narratives has caused some critics to insist that the subject of the latter account was not the same as the subject of the former.\" Perhaps the original name of the hero of the flood was actually Enoch. The Encyclopedia Judaica notes that Noah's drunkenness is not presented as reprehensible behavior. Rather, \"It is clear that ... Noah\u2019s venture into viticulture provides the setting for the castigation of Israel\u2019s Canaanite neighbors.\" It was Ham who committed an offense when he viewed his father's nakedness. Yet, \"Noah\u2019s curse, ... is strangely aimed at Canaan rather than the disrespectful Ham.\""

It is defined in Euclidean geometry as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and also has various equivalent definitions. It appears in many formulas in all areas of mathematics and physics. The earliest known use of the Greek letter \u03c0 to represent the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter was by the Welsh mathematician William Jones in 1706. It is also referred to as Archimedes's constant. As an irrational number,  cannot be expressed as a common fraction, although fractions such as  are commonly used to approximate it. Equivalently, its decimal representation never ends and never settles into a permanently repeating pattern. Its decimal (or other base) digits appear to be randomly distributed, and are conjectured to satisfy a specific kind of statistical randomness. It is known that  is a transcendental number: It is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients. The transcendence of  implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of squaring the circle with a compass and straightedge. Ancient civilizations, including the Egyptians and Babylonians, required fairly accurate approximations of  for practical computations. Around 250 BC, the Greek mathematician Archimedes created an algorithm to approximate  with arbitrary accuracy. In the 5th century AD, Chinese mathematics approximated  to seven digits, while Indian mathematics made a five-digit approximation, both using geometrical techniques. The first computational formula for , based on infinite series, was discovered a millennium later, when the Madhava\u2013Leibniz series was discovered by the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics, documented in the Yuktibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101, written around 1530. The invention of calculus soon led to the calculation of hundreds of digits of , enough for all practical scientific computations. Nevertheless, in the 20th and 21st centuries, mathematicians and computer scientists have pursued new approaches that, when combined with increasing computational power, extended the decimal representation of  to many trillions of digits. The primary motivation for these computations is as a test case to develop efficient algorithms to calculate numeric series, as well as the quest to break records. The extensive calculations involved have also been used to test supercomputers and high-precision multiplication algorithms. Because its most elementary definition relates to the circle,  is found in many formulae in trigonometry and geometry, especially those concerning circles, ellipses and spheres. In more modern mathematical analysis, it is instead defined using the spectral properties of the real number system, as an eigenvalue or a period, without any reference to geometry. It appears therefore in areas of mathematics and sciences having little to do with the geometry of circles, such as number theory and statistics, and in almost all areas of physics. The ubiquity of  makes it one of the most widely known mathematical constants inside and outside of the scientific community. Several books devoted to  have been published, and record-setting calculations of the digits of  often result in news headlines."

For example, if a circle has twice the diameter of another circle, it will also have twice the circumference, preserving the ratio . This definition of  implicitly makes use of flat (Euclidean) geometry; although the notion of a circle can be extended to any curve (non-Euclidean) geometry, these new circles will no longer satisfy the formula . Here, the circumference of a circle is the arc length around the perimeter of the circle, a quantity which can be formally defined independently of geometry using limits\u2014a concept in calculus.  For example, one may directly compute the arc length of the top half of the unit circle, given in Cartesian coordinates by the equation , as the integral: An integral such as this was adopted as the definition of  by Karl Weierstrass, who defined it directly as an integral in 1841. Integration is no longer commonly used in a first analytical definition because, as  explains, differential calculus typically precedes integral calculus in the university curriculum, so it is desirable to have a definition of  that does not rely on the latter.  One such definition, due to Richard Baltzer and popularized by Edmund Landau, is the following:  is twice the smallest positive number at which the cosine function equals 0.  The cosine can be defined independently of geometry as a power series, or as the solution of a differential equation. In a similar spirit,  can be defined using properties of the complex exponential, , of a complex variable . Like the cosine, the complex exponential can be defined in one of several ways. The set of complex numbers at which  is equal to one is then an (imaginary) arithmetic progression of the form: and there is a unique positive real number  with this property. A variation on the same idea, making use of sophisticated mathematical concepts of topology and algebra, is the following theorem: there is a unique (up to automorphism) continuous isomorphism from the group R/Z of real numbers under addition modulo integers (the circle group), onto the multiplicative group of complex numbers of absolute value one. The number  is then defined as half the magnitude of the derivative of this homomorphism."

There are several proofs that  is irrational; they generally require calculus and rely on the reductio ad absurdum technique. The degree to which  can be approximated by rational numbers (called the irrationality measure) is not precisely known; estimates have established that the irrationality measure is larger than the measure of  or  but smaller than the measure of Liouville numbers. The digits of  have no apparent pattern and have passed tests for statistical randomness, including tests for normality; a number of infinite length is called normal when all possible sequences of digits (of any given length) appear equally often. The conjecture that  is normal has not been proven or disproven. Since the advent of computers, a large number of digits of  have been available on which to perform statistical analysis. Yasumasa Kanada has performed detailed statistical analyses on the decimal digits of , and found them consistent with normality; for example, the frequencies of the ten digits 0 to 9 were subjected to statistical significance tests, and no evidence of a pattern was found. Any random sequence of digits contains arbitrarily long subsequences that appear non-random, by the infinite monkey theorem. Thus, because the sequence of 's digits passes statistical tests for randomness, it contains some sequences of digits that may appear non-random, such as a sequence of six consecutive 9s that begins at the 762nd decimal place of the decimal representation of .

Archimedes computed upper and lower bounds of  by drawing a regular hexagon inside and outside a circle, and successively doubling the number of sides until he reached a 96-sided regular polygon. By calculating the perimeters of these polygons, he proved that  (that is ). Archimedes' upper bound of  may have led to a widespread popular belief that  is equal to . Around 150 AD, Greek-Roman scientist Ptolemy, in his Almagest, gave a value for  of 3.1416, which he may have obtained from Archimedes or from Apollonius of Perga. Mathematicians using polygonal algorithms reached 39 digits of  in 1630, a record only broken in 1699 when infinite series were used to reach 71 digits. In ancient China, values for  included 3.1547 (around 1 AD),  (100 AD, approximately 3.1623), and  (3rd century, approximately 3.1556). Around 265 AD, the Wei Kingdom mathematician Liu Hui created a polygon-based iterative algorithm and used it with a 3,072-sided polygon to obtain a value of  of\u00a03.1416. Liu later invented a faster method of calculating  and obtained a value of 3.14 with a 96-sided polygon, by taking advantage of the fact that the differences in area of successive polygons form a geometric series with a factor of\u00a04. The Chinese mathematician Zu Chongzhi, around 480 AD, calculated that  and suggested the approximations  = 3.14159292035... and  = 3.142857142857..., which he termed the Mil\u00fc (''close ratio\") and Yuel\u00fc (\"approximate ratio\"), respectively, using Liu Hui's algorithm applied to a 12,288-sided polygon. With a correct value for its seven first decimal digits, this value remained the most accurate approximation of  available for the next 800 years.

French mathematician Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te in 1579 achieved 9 digits with a polygon of 3\u00d7217 sides. Flemish mathematician Adriaan van Roomen arrived at 15 decimal places in 1593.

An infinite series is the sum of the terms of an infinite sequence. Infinite series allowed mathematicians to compute  with much greater precision than Archimedes and others who used geometrical techniques. Although infinite series were exploited for  most notably by European mathematicians such as James Gregory and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, the approach was first discovered in India sometime between 1400 and 1500 AD. The first written description of an infinite series that could be used to compute  was laid out in Sanskrit verse by Indian astronomer Nilakantha Somayaji in his Tantrasamgraha, around 1500 AD. The series are presented without proof, but proofs are presented in a later Indian work, Yuktibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101, from around 1530 AD. Nilakantha attributes the series to an earlier Indian mathematician, Madhava of Sangamagrama, who lived c.\u00a01350\u00a0\u2013 c.\u00a01425. Several infinite series are described, including series for sine, tangent, and cosine, which are now referred to as the Madhava series or Gregory\u2013Leibniz series. Madhava used infinite series to estimate  to 11 digits around 1400, but that value was improved on around 1430 by the Persian mathematician Jamsh\u012bd al-K\u0101sh\u012b, using a polygonal algorithm. The first infinite sequence discovered in Europe was an infinite product (rather than an infinite sum, which is more typically used in  calculations) found by French mathematician Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te in 1593: The second infinite sequence found in Europe, by John Wallis in 1655, was also an infinite product: The discovery of calculus, by English scientist Isaac Newton and German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the 1660s, led to the development of many infinite series for approximating . Newton himself used an arcsin series to compute a 15 digit approximation of  in 1665 or 1666, later writing \"I am ashamed to tell you to how many figures I carried these computations, having no other business at the time.\" In Europe, Madhava's formula was rediscovered by Scottish mathematician James Gregory in 1671, and by Leibniz in 1674: This formula, the Gregory\u2013Leibniz series, equals  when evaluated with \u00a0=\u00a01. In 1699, English mathematician Abraham Sharp used the Gregory\u2013Leibniz series for  to compute  to 71 digits, breaking the previous record of 39 digits, which was set with a polygonal algorithm. The Gregory\u2013Leibniz for  series is simple, but converges very slowly (that is, approaches the answer gradually), so it is not used in modern  calculations. In 1706 John Machin used the Gregory\u2013Leibniz series to produce an algorithm that converged much faster: Machin reached 100 digits of  with this formula. Other mathematicians created variants, now known as Machin-like formulae, that were used to set several successive records for calculating digits of . Machin-like formulae remained the best-known method for calculating  well into the age of computers, and were used to set records for 250 years, culminating in a 620-digit approximation in 1946 by Daniel Ferguson\u00a0\u2013 the best approximation achieved without the aid of a calculating device. A record was set by the calculating prodigy Zacharias Dase, who in 1844 employed a Machin-like formula to calculate 200 decimals of  in his head at the behest of German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. British mathematician William Shanks calculated  to 607 digits in 1853, but made a mistake in the 528th digit, rendering all subsequent digits incorrect. Though he calculated an additional 100 digits in 1873, bring the total up to 707, his previous mistake rendered all the new digits incorrect as well."

Because Euler corresponded heavily with other mathematicians in Europe, the use of the Greek letter spread rapidly, and the practice was universally adopted thereafter in the Western world, though the definition still varied between 3.14... and 6.28... as late as 1761."

Mathematicians John Wrench and Levi Smith reached 1,120 digits in 1949 using a desk calculator. Using an inverse tangent (arctan) infinite series, a team led by George Reitwiesner and John von Neumann that same year achieved 2,037 digits with a calculation that took 70 hours of computer time on the ENIAC computer. The record, always relying on an arctan series, was broken repeatedly (7,480 digits in 1957; 10,000 digits in 1958; 100,000 digits in 1961) until 1 million digits were reached in 1973. Two additional developments around 1980 once again accelerated the ability to compute . First, the discovery of new iterative algorithms for computing , which were much faster than the infinite series; and second, the invention of fast multiplication algorithms that could multiply large numbers very rapidly. Such algorithms are particularly important in modern  computations because most of the computer's time is devoted to multiplication. They include the Karatsuba algorithm, Toom\u2013Cook multiplication, and Fourier transform-based methods. The iterative algorithms were independently published in 1975\u20131976 by physicist Eugene Salamin and scientist Richard Brent. These avoid reliance on infinite series. An iterative algorithm repeats a specific calculation, each iteration using the outputs from prior steps as its inputs, and produces a result in each step that converges to the desired value. The approach was actually invented over 160 years earlier by Carl Friedrich Gauss, in what is now termed the arithmetic\u2013geometric mean method (AGM method) or Gauss\u2013Legendre algorithm. As modified by Salamin and Brent, it is also referred to as the Brent\u2013Salamin algorithm. The iterative algorithms were widely used after 1980 because they are faster than infinite series algorithms: whereas infinite series typically increase the number of correct digits additively in successive terms, iterative algorithms generally multiply the number of correct digits at each step. For example, the Brent-Salamin algorithm doubles the number of digits in each iteration. In 1984, brothers John and Peter Borwein produced an iterative algorithm that quadruples the number of digits in each step; and in 1987, one that increases the number of digits five times in each step. Iterative methods were used by Japanese mathematician Yasumasa Kanada to set several records for computing  between 1995 and 2002. This rapid convergence comes at a price: the iterative algorithms require significantly more memory than infinite series."

Mathematicians Stan Wagon and Stanley Rabinowitz produced a simple spigot algorithm in 1995. Its speed is comparable to arctan algorithms, but not as fast as iterative algorithms. Another spigot algorithm, the BBP digit extraction algorithm, was discovered in 1995 by Simon Plouffe: This formula, unlike others before it, can produce any individual hexadecimal digit of  without calculating all the preceding digits. Individual binary digits may be extracted from individual hexadecimal digits, and octal digits can be extracted from one or two hexadecimal digits. Variations of the algorithm have been discovered, but no digit extraction algorithm has yet been found that rapidly produces decimal digits. An important application of digit extraction algorithms is to validate new claims of record  computations: After a new record is claimed, the decimal result is converted to hexadecimal, and then a digit extraction algorithm is used to calculate several random hexadecimal digits near the end; if they match, this provides a measure of confidence that the entire computation is correct.

The sinuosity is the ratio between the actual length and the straight-line distance from source to mouth. Faster currents along the outside edges of a river's bends cause more erosion than along the inside edges, thus pushing the bends even farther out, and increasing the overall loopiness of the river. However, that loopiness eventually causes the river to double back on itself in places and \"short-circuit\", creating an ox-bow lake in the process. The balance between these two opposing factors leads to an average ratio of  between the actual length and the direct distance between source and mouth."

The record for memorizing digits of , certified by Guinness World Records, is 70,000 digits, recited in India by Rajveer Meena in 9 hours and 27 minutes on 21 March 2015.  In 2006, Akira Haraguchi, a retired Japanese engineer, claimed to have recited 100,000 decimal places, but the claim was not verified by Guinness World Records. One common technique is to memorize a story or poem in which the word lengths represent the digits of : The first word has three letters, the second word has one, the third has four, the fourth has one, the fifth has five, and so on. Such memorization aids are called mnemonics. An early example of a mnemonic for pi, originally devised by English scientist James Jeans, is \"How I want a drink, alcoholic of course, after the heavy lectures involving quantum mechanics.\" When a poem is used, it is sometimes referred to as a piem. Poems for memorizing  have been composed in several languages in addition to English.

In the 2008 Open University and BBC documentary co-production, The Story of Maths, aired in October 2008 on BBC Four, British mathematician Marcus du Sautoy shows a visualization of the \u2013 historically first exact \u2013 formula for calculating  when visiting India and exploring its contributions to trigonometry. In the Palais de la D\u00e9couverte (a science museum in Paris) there is a circular room known as the pi room. On its wall are inscribed 707 digits of . The digits are large wooden characters attached to the dome-like ceiling. The digits were based on an 1873 calculation by English mathematician William Shanks, which included an error beginning at the 528th digit. The error was detected in 1946 and corrected in 1949. In Carl Sagan's 1985 novel Contact it is suggested that the creator of the universe buried a message deep within the digits of . The digits of  have also been incorporated into the lyrics of the song \"Pi\" from the 2005 album Aerial by Kate Bush. In the 1967 Star Trek episode \"Wolf in the Fold\", an out-of-control computer is contained by being instructed to \"Compute to the last digit the value of \", even though \" is a transcendental figure without resolution\". In the United States, Pi Day falls on 14\u00a0March (written 3/14 in the US style), and is popular among students.  and its digital representation are often used by self-described \"math geeks\" for inside jokes among mathematically and technologically minded groups. Several college cheers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology include \"3.14159\". Pi Day in 2015 was particularly significant because the date and time 3/14/15 9:26:53 reflected many more digits of pi. In parts of the world where dates are commonly noted in day/month/year format, 22 July represents \"Pi Approximation Day,\" as 22/7\u00a0=\u00a03.142857. During the 2011 auction for Nortel's portfolio of valuable technology patents, Google made a series of unusually specific bids based on mathematical and scientific constants, including . In 1958 Albert Eagle proposed replacing  by  (tau), where , to simplify formulas. However, no other authors are known to use  in this way. Some people use a different value, , arguing that , as the number of radians in one turn, or as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its radius rather than its diameter, is more natural than  and simplifies many formulas. Celebrations of this number, because it approximately equals 6.28, by making 28\u00a0June \"Tau Day\" and eating \"twice the pie\", have been reported in the media. However, this use of  has not made its way into mainstream mathematics. Tau was added to the Python programming language (as math.tau) in version 3.6. In 1897, an amateur mathematician attempted to persuade the Indiana legislature to pass the Indiana Pi Bill, which described a method to square the circle and contained text that implied various incorrect values for , including 3.2. The bill is notorious as an attempt to establish a value of scientific constant by legislative fiat. The bill was passed by the Indiana House of Representatives, but rejected by the Senate, meaning it did not become a law."

The title refers to the Caron perfume Narcisse Noir. Based on the 1939 novel by Rumer Godden, the film revolves around the growing tensions within a small convent of Anglican nuns who are trying to establish a school and hospital in the old palace of an Indian Raja at the top of an isolated mountain above a fertile valley in the Himalayas. The palace has ancient Indian erotic paintings on its walls and is run by the agent of the Indian general who owns it, a handsome middle-aged Englishman who is a source of sexual attraction for the nuns. Black Narcissus achieved considerable acclaim for its technical mastery with the cinematographer, Jack Cardiff, winning an Academy Award for Best Cinematography and a Golden Globe Award for Best Cinematography, and Alfred Junge winning an Academy Award for Best Art Direction. According to film critic David Thomson, \"Black Narcissus is that rare thing, an erotic English film about the fantasies of nuns, startling whenever Kathleen Byron is involved\"."

The convent will be located at Mopu, a dilapidated palace high on a cliff where the general's father previously kept his harem. An order of monks had already tried unsuccessfully to establish themselves there, and the general's agent  makes the social and environmental difficulties they will face plain to them. The ambitious Sister Clodagh is appointed Sister Superior and sent with four other nuns: Sister Philippa for the garden; Sister Briony for the infirmary; Sister Blanche, better known as \"Sister Honey\" to teach lace-making; and the emotionally unwell Sister Ruth for general classes. Mr Dean is unimpressed with them, and predicts they will manage to remain only until the beginning of the monsoon season. During their time setting up the convent, the nuns face troubles with the old building and with the local Hindu population, often clashing with the building's native caretaker Angu Ayah. They have difficulty accepting a holy man in their grounds (the general's uncle) who spends all his time staring into the mountains. They take in a local girl called Kanchi to try and control her erratic spirit, and give the general's current heir\u2014referred to as the Young General\u2014classes to understand Western culture prior to a trip to Britain. Kanchi is whipped by Ayah for stealing, but the Young General stops her and ends up falling for Kanchi in a situation compared by Mr Dean to the tale of \"The King and the Beggar-maid\". Each member of the order has troubles of her own caused by their surroundings, which seem to magnify emotions. Briony suffers from ill health, and Philippa loses herself in the environment and ends up planting the vegetable garden with flowers instead. Ruth, already highly strung, becomes increasingly jealous of Clodagh and obsessed with Mr Dean, leading her to renounce the order. Clodagh remembers a failed romance from her home in Ireland which had prompted her to join the order in the first place. Honey's growing attachment to the children ends in disaster when she gives medicine to a fatally ill baby. The child's death angers the locals, who blame and abandon the mission, and puts further strain on the nuns. Mr Dean unsuccessfully tries to persuade Clodagh to leave before anything else untoward happens. One night Clodagh confronts the now-unstable Ruth, finding her in a modern dress she had ordered to impress . Ruth escapes Clodagh's watch and finds . When he refuses her advances, she has a complete mental breakdown and goes back to the mission, intent on killing Clodagh. When Clodagh is ringing the bell for morning service located on a cliff edge, Ruth attempts to push her over the edge. In the resulting struggle, Ruth falls off the cliff to her death. The mission leaves just as the monsoon season begins, with Clodagh's final request to  being to tend Ruth's grave."

Film critic Dave Kehr has suggested that the final images of the film, as the nuns abandon the Himalayas and proceed down the mountain, could have been interpreted by British viewers in 1947 as \"a last farewell to their fading empire\"; he suggests that for the film-makers, it is not an image of defeat \"but of a respectful, rational retreat from something that England never owned nor understood\". The story in the film quite closely follows that of the book, which was published in 1939."

Pressburger described Byron as having a \"dreamy voice and great eyes like a lynx\", which he felt appropriate for the mentally disturbed character. In the role of the leading Sister Superior, Sister Clodagh, Deborah Kerr was cast. Pressburger chose Kerr for the role despite the reservations of Powell, who felt she was too young for the part. At one point, Powell considered Greta Garbo for the part.  Kerr was paid \u00a316,000 for fifty-five days of work. David Farrar was cast as Mr Dean, the virile British agent who becomes the object of Sister Ruth's obsession. Farrar was paid \u00a34,500 for forty-five days of shooting. Flora Robson appears as Sister Philippa, a gardening nun in the convent. Of the three principal Indian roles, only the Young General was played by an ethnic Indian, Sabu; the roles of Kanchi, played by Jean Simmons, and the Old General were performed by white actors in make-up. Kanchi, 17, is described by Godden as \"a basket of fruit, piled high and luscious and ready to eat. Though she looks shyly down, there is something steady and unabashed about her; the fruit is there to be eaten, she does not mean it to rot.\" Godden approved of Simmons's casting, remarking that she \"perfectly fulfilled my description\".

The film was shot primarily at Pinewood Studios but some scenes were shot in Leonardslee Gardens, West Sussex, the home of an Indian army retiree which had appropriate trees and plants for the Indian setting. While Powell at the time had been known for his love of location shooting, with Black Narcissus he became fascinated with the idea of filming as much in-studio as possible. The film is known for making extensive use of matte paintings and large-scale landscape paintings (credited to W. Percy Day) to suggest the mountainous environment of the Himalayas, as well as some scale models for motion shots of the convent. Powell said later: \"Our mountains were painted on glass. We decided to do the whole thing in the studio and that's the way we managed to maintain colour control to the very end. Sometimes in a film its theme or its colour are more important than the plot.\" For the costumes, Alfred Junge, the art director, had three main colour schemes. The nuns were always in the white habits that he designed from a medley of medieval types. These white robes of heavy material stressed the nuns' other-worldliness amid the exotic native surroundings. The chief native characters were robed in brilliant colours, particularly the generals in jewels and in rich silks. Other native characters brought into the film for \"atmosphere\" were clad in more sombre colours with the usual native dress of the Nepalese, Bhutanese and Tibetan peoples toned down to prevent overloading the eye with brilliance. According to Robert Horton, Powell set the climactic sequence, a murder attempt on the cliffs of the cloister, to a pre-existing musical track, staging it as though it were a piece of visual choreography. There was some personal, behind-the-scenes tension, as Kerr was the director's ex-lover and Byron his current one. \"It was a situation not uncommon in show business, I was told,\" Powell later wrote, \"but it was new to me.\" Originally the film was intended to end with an additional scene in which Sister Clodagh sobs and blames herself for the convent's failure to Mother Dorothea. Mother Dorothea touches and speaks to Sister Clodagh welcomingly as the latter's tears continue to fall. When they filmed the scene with the rainfall on the leaves in what was to have been the penultimate scene, Powell was so impressed with it that he decided to designate that the last scene and to scrap the Mother Dorothea closing scene. It was filmed but it is not known whether it was printed."

        "content": "Black Narcissus achieved acclaim for its pioneering technical mastery and shocked audiences at the time of release with its vibrant colour and the themes of the film. Audiences gasped at some of the scenes, notably the shot of the pink flowers which, shown on the big screen, was a spectacle at the time. The film's use of lighting and techniques have had a profound impact on later film makers, notably Martin Scorsese who used the extreme close-ups of the nuns as the inspiration for the treatment of Tom Cruise's character around the pool table in The Color of Money. Martin Scorsese has said that the film, particularly in its last quarter, is one of the earliest erotic films. The film was one of his favourites as a boy and one of the greatest experiences he has had with film is viewing Black Narcissus projected on a massive screen at the Director's Guild in 1983. In Michael Powell's own view, this was the most erotic film he ever made. \"It is all done by suggestion, but eroticism is in every frame and image from beginning to end. It is a film full of wonderful performances and passion just below the surface, which finally, at the end of the film, erupts.\" The English film critic Peter Bradshaw, who put it on his list of the ten best films ever made, took Powell's statement further, and said that it was the most erotic film he had ever seen. In The Great British Picture Show, the writer George Perry stated, \"Archers films looked better than they were\u00a0\u2013 the location photography in Technicolor by Jack Cardiff in Black Narcissus was a great deal better than the story and lifted the film above the threatening banality.\" In contrast, the critic Ian Christie wrote in the Radio Times in the 1980s that \"unusually for a British film from the emotionally frozen forties the melodrama works so well it almost seems as if Powell and Pressburger survived the slings and barbs of contemporary criticism to find their ideal audience in the 1980s\". Marina Warner, introducing the film on BBC2 (on a nun-themed film evening, with Th\u00e9r\u00e8se), called it a masterpiece. The film's resonance with populations exploring previously stifled sexual desires and expression extends beyond its contemporary milieu of women in the post-war era. Black Narcissus also influenced the themes and aesthetic of the ground-breaking gay experimental film Pink Narcissus, which portrays a series of pornographic vignettes in vivid colour as the fantasies of a prostitute between visits from his keeper. Although Pink Narcissus was lost in obscurity for some time, in recent years it has resurfaced as a cult classic, due in part to the vivid, fantastical aesthetic inspired by Black Narcissus. The look and cinematography of the 2013 Disney film Frozen was influenced by Black Narcissus. While working on the look and nature of the film's cinematography, Frozen art director Michael Giaimo was greatly influenced by Jack Cardiff's work in Black Narcissus."

Then America enters World War I. Jim informs his worried mother that he has no intention of enlisting, and his father threatens to kick him out of the house if he does not join.  However, when he runs into his patriotic friends at a send-off parade, he is persuaded to enlist, making his father very proud. During training, Jim makes friendships with Southern construction worker Slim (Karl Dane) and Bronx bartender Bull (Tom O'Brien). Their unit ships out to France, where they are billeted at a farm in the village of Champillon in the Marne. All three men are attracted to Melisande (Ren\u00e9e Ador\u00e9e), whose mother owns the farm. She repulses all their advances, but gradually warms to Jim, bonding at first over chewing gum. They eventually fall in love, despite not being able to speak each other's language. One day, however, Jim receives a letter and a photograph from Justyn (Claire Adams), which reveals that they are engaged. When Melisande sees the picture, she realizes the situation and runs off in tears. Before Jim can decide what to do, his unit is ordered to the front. Melisande hears the commotion and races back, just in time for the lovers to embrace and kiss. The Americans march towards the front and are strafed by an enemy fighter before it is shot down. The unit is sent to the attack immediately, advancing against snipers and machine guns in the woods, then more machine guns, artillery, and poison gas in the open. They settle down in a makeshift line. Jim shelters in a shellhole with Slim and Bull. That night, orders come down for one man to go out and eliminate a troublesome mortar crew; Slim wins a spitting contest for the opportunity. He succeeds, but is spotted and wounded on the way back. After listening to Slim's pleas for help, Jim cannot stand it any longer and goes to his rescue against orders. Bull follows, but is shot and killed. By the time Jim reaches Slim, he is already dead. Jim is then shot in the leg. When a German (George Beranger) comes to finish him off, Jim shoots and wounds him. The German starts crawling back to his line. Jim catches up to him in another shellhole, but, face to face, cannot bring himself to finish him off with his bayonet. Instead, he gives his erstwhile enemy a cigarette. Soon after, the German dies. However, Jim is not stuck in no man's land for long; the Americans attack, and he is taken away to a hospital. From another patient, he learns that Champillon has changed hands four times. Worried about Melisande, Jim sneaks out of the hospital and hitches a ride. When he gets to the farmhouse, he finds it damaged and empty. Melisande and her mother have joined a stream of refugees. Jim collapses and is carried off in an ambulance by retreating soldiers. After the war ends, Jim goes home to America. Before he arrives, his mother overhears Justyn and Jim's brother Harry (Robert Ober) discussing what to do; in Jim's absence, they have fallen in love. When Jim appears, it is revealed that he has had his leg amputated. Later, Jim tells his mother about Melisande; she tells him to go back and find her. When he returns to the farm, Melisande rushes into his arms."

The domestic earnings were MGM's biggest until the release of Gone with the Wind (1939). It played in some larger cities continually for a year or more, boosting Gilbert's career and made Ren\u00e9e Ador\u00e9e a major star, although Ador\u00e9e would soon be diagnosed with tuberculosis and die only a few years later. The film ultimately grossed $18\u2013$22 million in worldwide rentals and is sometimes proclaimed as the most successful film of the silent era, although it is most likely this record falls to The Birth of a Nation (1915). The film won the Photoplay Magazine Medal for best film of the year in 1925. The medal is considered the first significant annual movie award, prior to the establishment of the Oscars. After the film's producers found a clause in Vidor's contract that entitled the director to 20% of the net profits, studio lawyers called for a meeting with him. At the meeting, accountants upgraded the costs of the picture and downgraded their forecast of its potential success. Vidor was thus persuaded to sell his stake in the film before he could receive his percentage. However, the film's tremendous success established Vidor as one of MGM's top directors."

Composer Carl Davis created a new orchestral score for the film in the 1980s (quoting the theme associated with Melisande in Axt's original setting), and it was restored and released on video in the late 1980s as part of the MGM and British television Thames Silents project.  The original 35mm negative was subsequently discovered intact, and has been the source for theatrical showings and the DVD and Blu-ray editions (Blu-ray was released October 1, 2013).  Davis' score has also been featured on these later editions. The 2013 DVD and Blu-ray Warner Home Video release of The Big Parade features the most complete TCM print of running time 151 minutes. It also contains an audio commentary track by film historian Jeffrey Vance (with excerpts from King Vidor's oral history with the Directors Guild of America).

It is a film adaptation of the 1988 book of the same name by Michael Blake that tells the story of Union Army Lieutenant John J. Dunbar (Costner), who travels to the American frontier to find a military post, and of his dealings with a group of Lakota. Costner developed the film with an initial budget of $15\u00a0million. Much of the dialogue is spoken in Lakota with English subtitles. It was shot from July to November 1989 in South Dakota and Wyoming, and translated by Doris Leader Charge, of the Lakota Studies department at Sinte Gleska University. The film earned favorable reviews from critics and audiences, who praised Costner's directing, the performances, screenplay, and production values. The film was a box-office hit, grossing $424.2\u00a0million worldwide, making it the fourth-highest grossing film of 1990, and is the highest-grossing film for Orion Pictures. The film was nominated for 12 Academy Awards at the 63rd Academy Awards and won seven, including Best Picture, Best Director for Costner, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Film Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, and Best Sound Mixing. The film also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama. It is one of only three Westerns to win the Oscar for Best Picture, the other two being Cimarron (1931) and Unforgiven (1992). The film is credited as a leading influence for the revitalization of the Western genre of filmmaking in Hollywood. In 2007, Dances with Wolves was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\"."

        "content": "In 1863, 1st Lieutenant John J. Dunbar is wounded in battle at St. David's Field in Tennessee. Choosing death in battle over amputation of his foot, he takes a horse and rides up to and along the Confederate lines. Confederate forces fire repeatedly at him and miss, and the Union Army takes advantage of the distraction to mount a successful attack. Dunbar receives both a citation for bravery and medical care that allows him to keep his foot. He is subsequently awarded Cisco, the horse that carried him during his suicide attempt, and his choice of posting. Dunbar requests a transfer to the western frontier, so he can see it before it disappears. Dunbar is transferred to Fort Hays, a large fort commanded by Major Fambrough, an unhinged officer who despises Dunbar's enthusiasm.  He agrees to post Dunbar to the furthest outpost under his jurisdiction, Fort Sedgwick, and kills himself shortly afterwards. Dunbar travels with Timmons, a mule-wagon provisioner. They arrive to find the fort deserted. Despite the threat of nearby native tribes, Dunbar elects to stay and man the post himself. He begins rebuilding and restocking the fort, and prefers the solitude, recording many of his observations in his diary. Timmons is killed by Pawnee on the journey back to Fort Hays. The deaths of both Timmons and Fambrough leave the army unaware of Dunbar's assignment, and no other soldiers arrive to reinforce the post. Dunbar encounters his Sioux neighbors when they attempt to steal his horse and intimidate him. Deciding that being a target is a poor prospect, he decides to seek out the Sioux camp and attempt dialogue. On his way, he comes across Stands with a Fist, the white adopted daughter of the tribe's medicine man Kicking Bird, who is ritually mutilating herself while mourning for her husband. Dunbar brings her back to the Sioux to recover. Though the tribe is initially hostile, some of the members soon begin to respect him. Eventually, Dunbar establishes a rapport with Kicking Bird, the warrior Wind in His Hair, and the youth Smiles a Lot, initially visiting each other's camps. The language barrier frustrates them, and Stands with a Fist acts as an interpreter, although with difficulty. She only remembers a little English from her early childhood before the rest of her family was killed during a Pawnee raid. Dunbar discovers that the stories he had heard about the tribe were untrue, and he develops a growing respect and appreciation for their lifestyle and culture. Learning their language, he is accepted as an honored guest by the Sioux after he tells them of a migrating herd of buffalo and participates in the hunt. When at Fort Sedgwick, Dunbar befriends a wolf he dubs \"Two Socks\" for its white forepaws. Observing Dunbar and Two Socks chasing each other, the Sioux give him the name \"Dances with Wolves\".  During this time, Dunbar also forges a romantic relationship with Stands with a Fist and helps defend the village from an attack by the rival Pawnee tribe. Dunbar eventually wins Kicking Bird's approval to marry Stands with a Fist and abandons Fort Sedgwick. Because of the growing threat from the Pawnee and the U.S., Chief Ten Bears decides to move the tribe to its winter camp. Dunbar decides to accompany them, but must first retrieve his diary from Fort Sedgwick, as he realizes that it would provide the army with the means to find the tribe. When he arrives, he finds the fort reoccupied by the U.S. Army. Because of his Sioux clothing, the soldiers open fire, killing Cisco and capturing Dunbar, arresting him as a traitor. Two officers interrogate him, but Dunbar cannot prove his story, as a corporal has found his diary and kept it for himself. Having refused to serve as an interpreter to the tribes, Dunbar is charged with desertion and transported back east as a prisoner. Soldiers of the escort shoot Two Socks when the wolf attempts to follow Dunbar, despite Dunbar's attempts to intervene. Eventually, the Sioux track the convoy, killing the soldiers and freeing Dunbar. They assert that they do not see him as a white man, but as a Sioux warrior called Dances with Wolves. At the winter camp, Dunbar decides to leave with Stands with a Fist because his continuing presence would endanger the tribe. As they leave, Smiles a Lot returns the diary, which he recovered during Dunbar's liberation, and Wind in His Hair shouts to Dunbar, reminding him that he is Dunbar's friend, a contrast to their original meeting where he shouted at Dunbar in hostility. U.S. troops are seen searching the mountains, but cannot locate Dunbar or the tribe, while a lone wolf howls in the distance. An epilogue states: \"Thirteen years later\u2014their homes destroyed, their buffalo gone\u2014the last band of free Sioux submitted to white authority at Fort Robinson, Nebraska. The great horse culture of the plains was gone, and the American frontier was soon to pass into history.\""

        "content": "Originally written as a speculative script by Michael Blake, it went unsold in the mid-1980s. However, Kevin Costner had starred in Blake's only previous film, Stacy's Knights (1983), and encouraged Blake in early 1986 to turn the Western screenplay into a novel to improve its chances of being produced. The novel was rejected by numerous publishers, but finally was published in paperback in 1988. The rights were purchased by Costner, with an eye on directing it. Costner and his producing partner, Jim Wilson, had difficulty in raising money for the film. The project was turned down by several studios due to the Western genre no longer being popular, following the disastrous box office of Heaven's Gate (1980), as well as the length of the script. After the project languished at both Nelson Entertainment and Island Pictures due to budget reasons, Costner and Wilson enlisted producer Jake Eberts to manage foreign rights in several countries for Costner to retain final cut rights. The two then made a deal with Orion Pictures, in which the studio would distribute the film in North America. Actual production lasted from July 17 or 18 to November 21 or 23, 1989. Most of the movie was filmed on location in South Dakota, mainly on private ranches near Pierre and Rapid City, with a few scenes filmed in Wyoming. Specific locations included the Badlands National Park, the Black Hills, the Sage Creek Wilderness Area, and the Belle Fourche River area. The bison-hunt scenes were filmed at the Triple U Buffalo Ranch outside Fort Pierre, South Dakota, as were the Fort Sedgewick scenes, the set being constructed on the property."

The website's critical consensus reads: \"A grand, sweeping epic with inarguably noble intentions and arresting cinematography, but one whose center, arguably, is not as weighty as it should be.\" Metacritic gave the film a score of 72 out of 100 based on 20 critical reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade. Dances with Wolves was named one of the top ten films of 1990 by over 115 critics, and was named the best film of the year by 19 critics. Because of the film's popularity and lasting impact on the image of Native Americans, members of the Lakota Sioux Nation held a ceremony in Washington D.C., \"to honor Kevin [Costner] and Mary [McDonnell] and Jim [Wilson] on behalf of the Indian Lakota nation\", explained Floyd Red Crow Westerman (who plays Chief Ten Bears in the movie). Albert Whitehat, a Lakota elder who served as a cultural adviser on the film adopted Costner into his family, and two other families adopted McDonnell and Wilson. Westerman continued, that this is so \"They will all become part of one family.\" At the 63rd Academy Awards ceremony in 1991, Dances with Wolves earned 12 Academy Award nominations and won seven, including Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay (Michael Blake), Best Director (Costner), and Best Picture. In 2007, the Library of Congress selected Dances with Wolves for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. Some of the criticism of the film centered on the lack of authenticity of the Lakota language used in the film, as only one of the actors was a native speaker of the language. Oglala Lakota activist and actor Russell Means was critical of the film's lack of accuracy. In 2009, he said, \"Remember Lawrence of Arabia? That was Lawrence of the Plains. The odd thing about making that movie is that they had a woman teaching the actors the Lakota language, but Lakota has a male-gendered language and a female-gendered language. Some of the Natives and Kevin Costner were speaking in the feminine way. When I went to see it with a bunch of Lakota guys, we were laughing.\" Michael Smith (Sioux), the director of San Francisco's long-running annual American Indian Film Festival, said that despite criticisms, \"There's a lot of good feeling about the film in the Native community, especially among the tribes. I think it's going to be very hard to top this one.\" However, Blackfeet filmmaker George Budreau countered, \"I want to say, 'how nice,'... But no matter how sensitive and wonderful this movie is, you have to ask who's telling the story. It's certainly not an Indian.\" Though promoted as a breakthrough in its use of an Indigenous language, earlier English-language films, such as Eskimo (1933), Wagon Master (1950), and The White Dawn (1974) had also incorporated Native dialogue. David Sirota of Salon referred to Dances with Wolves as a \"white savior\" film, as Dunbar \"fully embeds himself in the Sioux tribe and quickly becomes its primary protector.\" He argued that its use of the \"noble savage\" character type \"preemptively blunts criticism of the underlying White Savior story. The idea is that a film like Dances with Wolves cannot be bigoted or overly white-centric if it at least shows [characters such as] Kicking Bird and Chief Ten Bears as special and exceptional. This, even though the whole story is about a white guy who saves the day.\""

Most accounts of Sioux\u2013Pawnee relations see the Pawnees, numbering only 4,000 at that time, as victims of the more powerful Sioux.\" The history and context of Fort Hays is radically different from that portrayed in the movie.  Historic Fort Hays was founded in 1867, with the iconic stone blockhouse being built immediately. Its predecessor, Fort Fletcher (1865-1868), was abandoned for only a few months and then relocated only a short distance in 1866. Fort Hays was founded in Cheyenne territory rather than Sioux. Rather than a desolate site, the fort was host to thousands of soldiers, railroad workers, and settlers from the start. The Kansas Pacific Railway and the settlements of Rome and Hays City were built next to the fort in 1867; each was a perceived violation of Cheyenne and Arapaho territory, resulting in immediate warfare with the Dog Soldiers. The fort was Sheridan's headquarters at the center of the 1867-68 conflict. A historic seasonal Pawnee tipi village had been located only  from Fort Hays, but the Pawnee had been excluded from it by other dominant tribes for some time by the 1860s. The real John Dunbar worked as a Christian missionary among the Pawnee in the 1830s\u201340s, and sided with the Native Americans in a dispute with government farmers and a local Indian agent. It is unclear whether the name \"John Dunbar\" was chosen as a corollary to the historical figure. The fictional Lieutenant John Dunbar of 1863 is correctly shown in the film wearing a gold bar on his officer shoulder straps, indicating his rank as a first lieutenant. From 1836 to 1872, the rank of first lieutenant was indicated by a gold bar; after 1872, the rank was indicated by a silver bar. Similarly, Captain Cargill is correctly depicted wearing a pair of gold bars, indicating the rank of captain at that time. Author and screenwriter Michael Blake said that Stands with a Fist, the white captive woman who marries Dunbar, was actually based upon the story of Cynthia Ann Parker, the white girl captured by Comanches and mother of Quanah Parker."

In a letter to British film reviewers, Kevin Costner and producer Jim Wilson addressed their reasons for presenting a longer version of the film: The genesis of the 4-hour version of the film was further explained in an article for Entertainment Weekly that appeared 10 months after the premiere of the original film. \"While the small screen has come to serve as a second chance for filmmakers who can't seem to let their babies go, Kevin Costner and his producing partner, Jim Wilson, hope that their newly completed version will hit theater screens first.\" Costner later stated that he did not work on the creation of the 4-hour cut at all."

        "content": "Man with a Movie Camera () is an experimental 1929 Soviet silent documentary film, directed by Dziga Vertov, filmed by his brother Mikhail Kaufman, and edited by his wife Yelizaveta Svilova. Kaufman also appears as the eponymous Man of the film. Vertov's feature film, produced by the film studio VUFKU, presents urban life in Moscow and the Ukrainian cities of Kyiv and Odesa during the late-1920s.  It has no actors. From dawn to dusk Soviet citizens are shown at work and at play, and interacting with the machinery of modern life. To the extent that it can be said to have \"characters\", they are the cameramen of the title, the film editor, and the modern Soviet Union they discover and present in the film. Man with a Movie Camera is famous for the range of cinematic techniques Vertov invented, employed or developed, such as multiple exposure, fast motion, slow motion, freeze frames, match cuts, jump cuts, split screens, Dutch angles, extreme close-ups, tracking shots, reversed footage, stop motion animations and self-reflexive visuals (at one point it features a split-screen tracking shot; the sides have opposite Dutch angles). Man with a Movie Camera was largely dismissed upon its initial release; the work's fast cutting, self-reflexivity, and emphasis on form over content were all subjects of criticism. In the British Film Institute's 2012 Sight & Sound poll, however, film critics voted it the 8th greatest film ever made, and it was later named the best documentary of all time in the same magazine."

Each part begins with a number appearing on screen and falling down flat. The film makes use of many  editing techniques, such as superimposition, slow motion, fast motion, rapid cross-cutting, and montage. The film has an unabashedly avant-garde style, and the subject matter varies greatly. The titular man with the movie camera (Mikhail Kaufman, Vertov's brother) travels to diverse locations to capture a variety of shots. He appears in artistic images such as a superimposed shot of the cameraman setting up his camera atop a second, mountainous camera, and another superimposed shot of the cameraman inside a beer glass. General images include laborers at work, sporting events, couples getting married and divorced, a woman giving birth, and a funeral procession. Much of the film is concerned with people of varying economic classes navigating urban environments. On occasion, the film's editor (Svilova) is shown working with strips of film and various pieces of editing equipment. Despite claiming to be without actors, the film features a few staged situations. This includes some of the cameraman's actions, the scene of a woman getting dressed, and chess pieces being swept to the center of the board (a shot spliced in backwards so the pieces expand outward and stand in position). Stop-motion is used for several shots, including an unmanned camera on a tripod standing up, showing off its mechanical parts, and then walking off screen."

Vertov, along with other kino artists declared it their mission to abolish all non-documentary styles of film-making, a radical approach to movie making. Most of Vertov's films were highly controversial, and the kinok movement was despised by many filmmakers. Vertov's crowning achievement, Man with a Movie Camera, was his response to critics who rejected his previous film, A Sixth Part of the World. Critics had declared that Vertov's overuse of \"intertitles\" was inconsistent with the film-making style to which the \"kinoks\" subscribed. Working within that context, Vertov dealt with a lot of fear in anticipation of the film's release. He requested a warning to be printed in the Soviet central Communist newspaper Pravda, which spoke directly of the film's experimental, controversial nature. Vertov was worried that the film would be either destroyed or ignored by the public. Upon the official release of Man with a Movie Camera, Vertov issued a statement at the beginning of the film, which read:"

        "content": "Working within a Marxist ideology, Vertov strove to create a futuristic city that would serve as a commentary on existing ideals in the Soviet world. This artificial city's purpose was to awaken the Soviet citizen through truth and to ultimately bring about understanding and action. The kino's aesthetic shone through in his portrayal of electrification, industrialization, and the achievements of workers through hard labour. This could also be viewed as early modernism in film. Some have mistakenly stated that many visual ideas, such as the quick editing, the close-ups of machinery, the store window displays, even the shots of a typewriter keyboard are borrowed from Walter Ruttmann's Berlin: Symphony of a Great City (1927), which predates Man with a Movie Camera by two years, but as Vertov wrote to the German press in 1929, these techniques and images had been developed and employed by him in his Kino-Pravda newsreels and documentaries for previous ten years, all of which predate Berlin. Vertov's pioneering cinematic concepts actually inspired other abstract films by Ruttmann and others, including writer, translator, filmmaker and critic Liu Na'ou (1905\u20131940), whose The Man Who Has a Camera (1933) pays explicit homage to Vertov's Man with a Movie Camera. Man with a Movie Cameras usage of double exposure and seemingly \"hidden\" cameras made the movie come across as a surreal montage rather than a linear motion picture. Many of the scenes in the film contain people, which change size or appear underneath other objects (double exposure). Because of these aspects, the movie is fast-moving. The sequences and close-ups capture emotional qualities that could not be fully portrayed through the use of words. The film's lack of \"actors\" and \"sets\" makes for a unique view of the everyday world; one that, according to a title card, is directed toward the creation of a new cinematic language that is \"[separated] from the language of theatre and literature\"."

        "content": "Man with a Movie Camera was not always a highly regarded work. The film was criticized for both the stagings and the stark experimentation, possibly as a result of its director's frequent assailing of fiction film as a new \"opiate of the masses\". Vertov's Soviet contemporaries criticized its focus on form over content, with Sergei Eisenstein even deriding the film as \"pointless camera hooliganism\". The work was largely dismissed in the West as well. Documentary filmmaker Paul Rotha said that in Britain, Vertov was \"regarded really as rather a joke, you know. All this cutting, and one camera photographing another camera \u2013 it was all trickery, and we didn't take it seriously.\" The pace of the film's editing \u2013 more than four times faster than a typical 1929 feature, with approximately 1,775 separate shots \u2013 also perturbed some viewers, including The New York Times reviewer Mordaunt Hall: The producer, Dziga Vertov, does not take into consideration the fact that the human eye fixes for a certain space of time that which holds the attention."

        "content": "Antz is a 1998 American computer-animated adventure comedy film directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson (in their feature directorial debuts) from a screenplay by Todd Alcott, Chris Weitz, and Paul Weitz. The film features the voices of Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Jennifer Lopez, Sylvester Stallone, Christopher Walken, Dan Aykroyd, Anne Bancroft, Danny Glover and Gene Hackman. Some of the main characters share facial similarities with the actors who voice them. Antz was the first film from DreamWorks Animation, and the third feature-length computer-animated film after Disney and Pixar's Toy Story (1995) and NDR Filmes's Cassiopeia (1996). During its production, a public feud erupted between DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Steve Jobs and John Lasseter of Pixar, due to the production of their similar film A Bug's Life, which was released a month later. This only worsened when Disney refused to avoid competition with DreamWorks' intended first animated release, The Prince of Egypt (1998). Antz premiered on September 19, 1998, at the Toronto International Film Festival, and was released theatrically in the United States on October 2, 1998, by DreamWorks Pictures. It grossed $171.8 million worldwide on a budget of $42\u2013105 million. The film received positive reviews, with critics praising the voice cast, animation, humor, and its appeal towards adults."

        "content": "Z is an anxious worker ant who chafes at conformity and the fact that everyone, even his psychiatrist, reminds him he is insignificant. While at the colony's bar one night, Z falls in love with Princess Bala when she visits the bar to escape her suffocating royal life. The ant colony declares war on an encroaching termite colony, and soldiers are sent to engage the invaders. To see Bala again, Z exchanges places with his soldier friend, Weaver, and joins the army, where he befriends staff sergeant Barbatus. The ants are unaware that General Mandible, the army's leader and Bala's fiancee, is secretly sending the soldiers loyal to the Queen to die so he can stage a coup d'\u00e9tat. In the battle, everyone except Z is killed by much-larger acid-shooting termite defenders. Before dying, Barbatus tells Z to think for himself instead of blindly following orders. Meanwhile, Weaver joins the digging crew and falls in love with Z's co-worker, Azteca. Z returns home and is mistakenly hailed as a war hero. Secretly unsatisfied, Mandible congratulates him and introduces him to the Queen. There, Z meets Bala, who recognizes him as a worker. Z panics and pretends to take Bala hostage, causing him and Bala to fall out of the anthill via a garbage chute. Now a fugitive, Z decides to search for Insectopia, a legendary insect paradise. Bala attempts to return to the colony, but quickly rejoins Z after encountering a praying mantis. Z' act of individuality inspires the workers and some soldier ants, halting productivity. To gain control, Mandible publicly portrays Z as a self-centered war criminal, promotes the glory of conformity and promises the workers rewards for completing a \"Mega Tunnel\" he designed. However, Mandible's second-in-command, a flying ant named Cutter, begins to doubt Mandible's constant reassurances that he's acting \"for the good of the colony\". Z and Bala come upon a human picnic, which they mistake for Insectopia. They are baffled by the wrappings on the food, but Muffy and Chip, a married couple of liberal wasps, condescendingly befriend them and try to help break the wrappers. They are disrupted by the humans, who kill Muffy with a fly swatter and attempt to squish them with a shoe. Z rescues Bala from the sneaker, and the two ants at last find Insectopia, a trash can overfilled with decaying food. Bala begins to reciprocate Z' feelings. After interrogating Weaver, Mandible learns that Z is looking for Insectopia and sends Cutter to find it. That night, Cutter arrives at Insectopia and forcibly flies Bala back to the colony while Z is away. Seeing Z' desperation at finding Bala gone, a drunken Chip, mourning over Muffy's death, generously flies him back to the colony. When Z arrives, he encounters soldiers who forcibly direct him toward the Mega Tunnel. Along the way, he finds Bala held captive in Mandible's office. After he frees her, they both discover that Mandible's Mega Tunnel leads straight to the puddle next to Insectopia, which Mandible will use to drown the Queen Ant and the workers at the opening ceremony. Bala warns the Queen while Z attempts to stop the workers in time, but fails. Z and Bala unify the Queen and workers into building a ladder of themselves towards the surface as the water rises. Meanwhile, Mandible gathers the soldiers on the surface and gloats he has created a new colony, where only the strong survive. When the worker ants break through the surface, Cutter turns on Mandible and rescues the worker ants \"for the good of the colony\". Enraged, Mandible attempts to tackle Cutter, but Z intervenes and takes the blow. He and Mandible fall back into the flooded tunnel, with Mandible striking a root and dying on impact. Z is nearly drowned, but is rescued by Cutter and resuscitated by Bala. Z is praised for his heroism, and he and Bala become a couple. Together, they rebuild the colony, and Z narrates that he is finally content with his place in the world. The camera then zooms out to show the anthill is in Central Park in New York City."

Years later, Jeffrey Katzenberg, then chairman of Disney's film division, had left the company in a feud with CEO Michael Eisner over the vacant president position after the death of Frank Wells. Katzenberg would later go on to help co-found DreamWorks with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen, and the three planned to rival Disney with the company's new animation division. Katzenberg at DreamWorks began developing projects he tried to pursue or suggested while at Disney, including The Prince of Egypt, a collaboration with Aardman Animations which resulted in Chicken Run, Sinbad, and Army Ants. Production began in May 1996, after production had already commenced on The Prince of Egypt. DreamWorks had contracted Pacific Data Images (PDI) in Palo Alto, California to begin working on computer-animated films to rival Pixar's features. Woody Allen was cast in the lead role of Z, and much of Allen's trademark humor is present within the film. Allen himself made some uncredited rewrites to the script, to make the dialogue better fit his style of comedic timing.

        "content": "After DreamWorks' acquisition of PDI, Pixar director John Lasseter, Steve Jobs, and others at Pixar were dismayed to learn from the trade papers that PDI's first project at DreamWorks would be another ant film, to be called Antz. By this time, Pixar's project, then similarly called Bugs, was well known within the animation community. In general, both Antz and A Bug's Life center on a young male ant, a drone with oddball tendencies, who struggles to win a princess's hand by saving their society. Lasseter and Jobs believed that the idea was stolen by Katzenberg. Katzenberg had stayed in touch with Lasseter after the acrimonious Disney split, often calling to check up. In October 1995, when Lasseter was overseeing postproduction work on Toy Story at the Universal Studios lot, where DreamWorks was also located, Lasseter and Andrew Stanton visited Katzenberg and they discussed their plans for Bugs in detail. Lasseter had high hopes for Toy Story, and he was telling friends throughout the tight-knit computer-animation business to get cracking on their own films. \"If this hits, it's going to be like space movies after Star Wars\" for computer-animation studios, he told various friends. \"I should have been wary,\" Lasseter later recalled. \"Jeffrey kept asking questions about when it would be released.\" When the trades indicated production on Antz, Lasseter, feeling betrayed, called Katzenberg and asked him bluntly if it were true, Katzenberg confirming it. Katzenberg recalled Antz came from a 1991 story pitch by Tim Johnson that was related to Katzenberg in October 1994. Another source gives Nina Jacobson, one of Katzenberg's executives, as the person responsible for the Antz pitch. Lasseter refused to believe Katzenberg's story. Lasseter recalled that Katzenberg was under the impression that Disney was \"out to get him\" and that he realized that he was just cannon fodder in Katzenberg's fight with Disney. Eisner had decided not to pay Katzenberg his contract-required bonus, convincing Disney's board not to give him anything. Lasseter grimly relayed the news of Antz to Pixar employees but kept morale high. Privately, Lasseter told other executives that he and Stanton felt terribly let down."

        "content": "At the time, the current Disney studio executives were starting a bitter competitive rivalry with Jeffrey Katzenberg and his new DreamWorks films. In 1995, Katzenberg announced The Prince of Egypt to debut in November 1998 as DreamWorks' first animated release. A year later, Disney scheduled Bugs to open on the same weekend, which infuriated Katzenberg. Katzenberg invited Disney executives to DreamWorks to negotiate a release date change for Bugs, but the company refused to budge. DreamWorks pushed Prince of Egypt to the Christmas season and the studio had decided not to begin full marketing for Antz until after Prince of Egypt was released. Disney afterward announced release dates for films that were going to compete with The Prince of Egypt, and both studios had to compete with Paramount Pictures, which was releasing The Rugrats Movie in November, based on Nickelodeon's animated series Rugrats. Katzenberg suddenly moved the opening of Antz from March 1999 to October 1998, in order to successfully beat A Bug's Life into cinemas. David Price writes in his 2008 book The Pixar Touch that a rumor, \"never confirmed\", was that Katzenberg had given PDI \"rich financial incentives to induce them to whatever it would take to have Antz ready first, despite Pixar's head start\". Jobs furiously called Katzenberg to explain that there was nothing he could do to convince Disney to change the date. Katzenberg said to him that Jobs himself had taught him how to conduct similar business long ago, explaining that Jobs had come to Pixar's rescue from near bankruptcy by making the deal for Toy Story with Disney. He flat-out told Jobs that he had enough power with Disney to convince them to change specific plans on their films. Lasseter also claimed Katzenberg had phoned him with a final proposition to delay Antz if Disney and Pixar changed the date of A Bug's Life, but Katzenberg vehemently denied this. Jobs believed it was \"a blatant extortion attempt\"."

        "content": "As the release dates for both films approached, Disney executives concluded that Pixar should keep quiet on Antz and the feud concerning DreamWorks. Regardless, Lasseter publicly dismissed Antz as a \"schlock version\" of A Bug's Life; however, Lasseter later admitted that he never saw the film. Lasseter claimed that if DreamWorks and PDI had made the film about anything other than insects, he would have closed Pixar for the day so the entire company could go see it. Jobs and Katzenberg would not back down and the rivaling ant films provoked a press frenzy. \"The bad guys rarely win,\" Jobs told the Los Angeles Times. In response, DreamWorks\u2019 head of marketing Terry Press suggested, \"Steve Jobs should take a pill.\" Tensions would remain high between Jobs and Katzenberg for many years after the release of both films. According to Jobs, years later, Katzenberg approached him after the opening of Shrek, and insisted that he had never heard the pitch for A Bug's Life, reasoning that his settlement with Disney would have given him a share of the profits if that were so. In the end, Pixar and PDI employees kept up the old friendships that had arisen from working in computer animation for years before feature films. The final product of both films are generally perceived to contrast one another in tone and certain plot points. Antz in the end seemed to be more geared towards older audiences, featuring moderate violence, mild sexual innuendoes, and profanity, as well as social and political satire. A Bug's Life was more family-friendly and lighthearted in tone and story. The two films especially differ in their artistic look: Antz played off more realistic aspects of ants and how they relate to other bugs, like termites and wasps, while A Bug's Life offered a more fanciful look at insects to better suit its story. PopMatters journalist J.C. Ma\u00e7ek III compared the two films and wrote, \"The feud deepened with both teams making accusations and excuses and a release date war ensued. While Antz beat A Bug's Life to the big screen by two months, the latter film significantly out grossed its predecessor. Rip off or not, Antz'''s critical response has proven to be almost exactly as positive as what A Bug's Life has enjoyed.\""

The film's widest release was 2,929 theatres, and closed on February 18, 1999. The film altogether picked up $90,757,863 domestically, but failed to outgross the competition with A Bug's Life. The film picked up an additional $81 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $171.8 million. According to DreamWorks, the film's budget was about $42 million, while the numbers $60 million and $105 million were also reported. According to Los Angeles Times, the first figure was doubted by the film industry, considering that other computer-animated films at the time cost twice of that amount, and that the budget did not include start-up costs of PDI."

        "content": "Road to Perdition is a 2002 American neo-noir period crime drama film directed by Sam Mendes. The screenplay was adapted by David Self from the graphic novel of the same name written by Max Allan Collins and illustrated by Richard Piers Rayner. The film stars Tom Hanks, Paul Newman (in his final live-action theater film acting role), Jude Law, and Daniel Craig. The plot takes place in 1931, during the Great Depression, following a mob enforcer and his son as they seek vengeance against a mobster who murdered the rest of their family. Filming took place in the Chicago area. Mendes, having recently finished 1999's acclaimed American Beauty, pursued a story that had minimal dialogue and conveyed emotion in the imagery. Cinematographer Conrad L. Hall took advantage of the environment to create symbolism for the film, for which he won several awards, including a posthumous Academy Award for Best Cinematography. The film explores several themes, including the consequence of violence and father-son relationships. Road to Perdition was released on July 12, 2002, and eventually grossed over $181 million worldwide. The film was well-received by critics, who mainly praised the direction and visuals, performances (particularly of Hanks,  Newman, and Law), cinematography, themes and setting. In addition to Hall's win for cinematography, the film earned five Academy Awards nominations, including Best Supporting Actor for Newman."

        "content": "The film begins and ends in 1931 during the Great Depression with a voiceover from Michael Sullivan, Jr., speaking about his father. Michael Sullivan, Sr. was orphaned then raised by Irish mob boss John Rooney in Rock Island, Illinois, and is now his most fearsome enforcer, unknown to his own son. Rooney has come to love Sullivan more than his own biological son, the rash and unpredictable Connor. Speaking at his brother's wake, Rooney's associate Finn McGovern insinuates that Rooney is responsible for his brother's death. Rooney sends Connor and Sullivan to talk with McGovern, while twelve-year-old Michael watches through a hole in the wall, after hiding in the back of the family car. McGovern steadfastly denies that his brother stole anything from the mob before implying Connor was responsible - and Connor shoots him on the spot before Sullivan shoots the other witnesses. Michael's shocked reaction gives him away and the boy is sworn to secrecy. The next day Rooney visits the house to intimidate the boy, and he soon begins acting out. At a meeting with his mob associates, Rooney pointedly humiliates Connor after he halfheartedly apologizes for McGovern's murder. Then he sends Sullivan to collect a debt from a speakeasy owner Tony Calvino. Connor, jealous and afraid, sends a letter with Sullivan for Calvino. Calvino reads it then reaches for his revolver, but Sullivan kills both Calvino and his bodyguard. The letter reads \"Kill Sullivan and all debts are paid\", and he rushes home. Connor has been there before him,  killing Sullivan's wife, Annie, and their younger son Peter just as Michael arrives home late from school after detention. He hears the shots, and stays hidden as he sees Connor leave. Sullivan and Michael flee Rock Island and head to Chicago to meet Frank Nitti. He offers to work for the Chicago Outfit in exchange for permission to kill Connor, but Nitti rejects the offer. Rooney, listening next door with Connor, reluctantly allows Nitti to dispatch freelance killer Harlen Maguire, who doubles as a crime scene photographer, to kill Sullivan - but forbids them to kill his son Michael, despite the risks down the road. Maguire tracks Sullivan to a roadside diner where they seem to converse casually while Michael hides in the car, but Sullivan's instincts send him escaping through the bathroom, before he punctures Maguire's car tire and drives off with Maguire shooting at him. Aware of the hit man now, Sullivan begins robbing banks that hold the Outfit's money, hoping to trade it for Connor. Sullivan is impeded when the mob withdraws its money, so he visits Rooney's accountant Alexander Rance. Rance stalls Sullivan until Maguire enters with a shotgun, killing Rance while Sullivan escapes with Rooney's ledgers. Michael drives them to a farm because Sullivan was wounded, where a childless elderly couple helps him recover. Sullivan's bond with his son grows deeper as he recovers and Michael comes to realize his father loves him. The ledgers reveal that Connor has been embezzling from his father for years, using the names of dead men including McGovern. Believing Rooney will call off the hit if he knows the truth, Sullivan gifts the couple a chunk of the stolen cash and heads back to Chicago. Sullivan confronts Rooney at Mass, learning Rooney already knows about Connor and expects he will be killed \u2013 if not by Sullivan, then by Nitti's men once Rooney is dead. He still refuses to give up his son and urges Sullivan to flee with Michael and ensure he becomes a better man than either of them. Later one night, cloaked by darkness and rain, Sullivan ambushes and kills Rooney's bodyguards with a Thompson submachine gun before walking up to Rooney, who looks him in the eye and says, \"I'm glad it's you,\" as Sullivan shoots him at point-blank range. Having no further reasons to protect Connor now that Rooney is dead, Nitti reveals Connor's location after Sullivan promises the feud ends with his death. Sullivan goes to the hotel where Connor is hiding and kills him in the bathtub. Sullivan takes his son to his Aunt Sarah's beach house in Perdition, on the shore of Lake Michigan, where he is ambushed and shot by Maguire inside the house as Michael stands on the beach. As Maguire photographs the dying Sullivan, Michael appears and points a gun at Maguire but cannot bring himself to pull the trigger. As Maguire beckons to Michael to give him the gun, Sullivan fatally shoots Maguire. Sullivan tells his son he knew he couldn't do it before dying in his arms. Michael says his father's fear was that he would follow the same road, and that he has not held a gun since his father died. Michael drives the car back to the farm, saying he grew up there, and now when he is asked if his father was a good man, he just tells them, \"He was my father.\""

By 1999, the novel had reached Dean Zanuck, who was the vice president of development at the company owned by his father, producer Richard D. Zanuck. The novel was sent to the elder Zanuck in Morocco, who was there producing Rules of Engagement (2000). The Zanucks agreed on the story's prospect and sent it to director-producer Steven Spielberg. Shortly afterward, Spielberg set up the project at his studio DreamWorks, though he did not pursue direction of the film due to his full slate. Mendes sought a new project after completing American Beauty (1999) and explored prospects including A Beautiful Mind, K-PAX, The Shipping News, and The Lookout. DreamWorks sent Mendes Road to Perdition as a prospect, and Mendes was attracted to the story, considering it \"narratively very simple, but thematically very complex\". One theme that he saw in the story was of the parents' world that is inaccessible to their children. Mendes considered the story's theme to be about how children deal with violence, and whether exposure to violence would render children violent themselves. Mendes described the script as having \"no moral absolutes\", a factor that appealed to the director."

        "title": "Road to Perdition_Writing",
        "content": "Spielberg first contacted screenwriter David Self to adapt the story into a feature film. Self wrote an initial draft that remained close to the source material and retained most of its dialogue. The screenplay was then rewritten by uncredited writers, distancing the script from the graphic novel and leaving the core elements of the story. Some of the harsher aspects of the story were toned down as the script became more streamlined; for example, in some early drafts of the screenplay, Sullivan became an alcoholic, but this element was ultimately absent from the final version. The story itself is deeply informed by the Lone Wolf and Cub manga series. Novelist Max Allan Collins acknowledged the influence of Lone Wolf and Cub on his graphic novel Road to Perdition in an interview to the BBC, declaring that \"Road To Perdition is 'an unabashed homage' to Lone Wolf and Cub\". Some of the characters' names were slightly changed from their original versions from the graphic novel: the surname of the real-life gangsters John Looney and his son Connor were changed to Rooney, and the surname of Tom Hanks' character and his family was streamlined from the original O'Sullivan to simply Sullivan. One significant addition to the script was the creation of Maguire to provide a persistent element of pursuit to the Sullivans' departure from the old world. Hanks and cinematographer Conrad Hall requested Mendes to limit violence in the film to meaningful acts, rather than gratuitous carnage. Hanks' character, Michael Sullivan, is known as \"The Angel of Death\" in the graphic novel and invokes fear in those around him, but his infamy is downplayed in the film. Mendes, who described the graphic novel as \"much more pulpy\", sought to reduce the graphic novel's background to its essence, seeking the \"nonverbal simplicity\" of films like Once Upon a Time in America (1984), Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973), and films by Akira Kurosawa that lack dialogue. Duplicate language in characters' confrontations in Road to Perdition was trimmed to the absolute minimum. Mendes described Road to Perdition as a \"poetic, elegiac story, in which the pictures tell the story\". An example of one such unspoken scene in the film was the piano duet between Rooney and Michael Sr., intended to convey their relationship without words. In the final 20 minutes of Road to Perdition, the script was written to have only six lines of dialogue. Max Allan Collins originally wanted to write the adapted screenplay, but was not given the opportunity. He chose to stay out of the scripting process out of respect for the different style of writing for a different medium, though he served as a consultant in the process. Collins praised the addition of Maguire and considered the minimalist use of dialogue to be appropriate. The author also applauded the film's version of Rooney as \"more overtly a father figure\" to Sullivan. Collins opposed the profanity in the script, as the vulgar language did not fit his vision of the 1930s. He also contested the path of Sullivan's son in the film. In the graphic novel, the son kills once, and in the film, he does not kill anyone. Collins also disagreed with the narration technique of the film. In the novel, the son narrates the story as an adult, becoming a priest, while in the film, he narrates while still a young boy."

        "content": "Tom Hanks was sent a copy of the graphic novel by Steven Spielberg while he was filming Cast Away. Initially too busy to make sense of the story, he later received David Self's adapted screenplay, to which he became attached. Hanks, a father to four children, described Michael Sullivan's role, \"I just got this guy. If you're a man, and you've got offspring ... emotionally, it's devastating.\" Tyler Hoechlin was chosen from over 2,000 candidates to portray Michael Sullivan's son. The actor was 14 years old at the time of filming. For scenes in which Hoechlin's character assisted his father as a getaway driver, Hoechlin was trained by a driving instructor. Paul Newman was unanimously the first choice for the role of John Rooney. The actor prepared by requesting Frank McCourt, the Irish-American author of Angela's Ashes, to record a tape of his voice. David Self, who created the Maguire character, explained, \"He gets so jaded from exposure to this world, he steps over the line from being the storyteller to being the story maker.\" To capture the \"seedy countenance\" of the character, Jude Law was given a sallow skin tone that reflected the wear from working in a darkroom. Law's teeth also received a lower gumline and had a rotted look. He was also given a weak, thinning hairline. Maguire's apartment also displays a collection of photographs of dead bodies, some of them actual police stills from the 1930s. Stanley Tucci was selective about roles in gangster films, believing that Hollywood stereotyped Italian-Americans as gangsters. However, attracted by the prospect of working with Mendes, the actor accepted the role of Nitti, a real-life Mob boss from Chicago. Anthony LaPaglia was cast as Al Capone and filmed a single scene, which was omitted from the final cut, and can be found in the DVD's deleted scenes. Mendes believed that Capone was more menacing as an unseen presence. Actor Alfred Molina was approached to portray Capone, but Molina was forced to turn the role down due to scheduling conflicts with Frida (2002)."

He chose to film Road to Perdition on location in Chicago, IL including downtown at the University Club of Chicago, the Chicago neighborhood of Pullman, the Charles G. Dawes House in Evanston, Illinois, as well as the far west Chicago suburb of Geneva, Illinois. General Jones Armory, the state's largest location mainstay which houses units of the Illinois National Guard, was provided to the studio by the Illinois State Film Commission. Sets were built inside the armory, including interiors of the Sullivan family's home and the Rooney mansion. The availability of an inside location provided the crew complete control over the lighting environment, which was established with the rigging of scaffoldings. Mendes collaborated with costume designer Albert Wolsky, production designer Dennis Gassner, and cinematographer Conrad Hall to design the film's style. Wolsky designed costumes that were \"very controlled, with soft outlines and very soft silhouettes\". Gassner built sets that could capture the cold look of the era. Mendes sought a muted palette for the film, having dark backgrounds and sets with dark, muted greens and grays. Mendes filmed Road to Perdition using the Super 35 format. The director filmed exterior scenes in Illinois in the winter and the spring of 2001, using real weather conditions such as snow, rain, and mud for the scenes. Mendes considered the usage of bleak weather conditions and the intended coldness of Gassner's exterior locations to define the characters' emotional states. Pullman became a key location to reflect this theme, having several settings, including the town's historic Florence Hotel, easily redressed by the crew for the film. Filming concluded in June 2001."

        "content": "To establish the lighting of scenes in Road to Perdition, Mendes drew from the paintings of Edward Hopper as a source of inspiration, particularly Hopper's New York Movie (1939). Mendes and cinematographer Conrad Hall sought to convey similar atmospheric lighting for the film's scenes, applying a \"less is more\" mantra. Hall also shot at wide apertures that retained one point in the depth of field sharply focused. Hall considered the technique to provide an emotional dimension to the scenes. The cinematographer also used unconventional techniques and materials to create unique lighting effects. One of Hall's methods was to use black silk in daylight exterior scenes to filter the light enough to create an in-shade look. Hall purposely distanced the camera from Hanks' character, Michael Sullivan Sr., at the beginning of the film to establish the perspective of Sullivan's son, who is unaware of his father's true nature. Hanks' character was filmed as partially obscured and seen through doorways, and his entrances and exits took place in shadows. A wide lens was used to maintain a distance from the character. Shots in the film were drawn directly from panels in the graphic novel, illustrated by Richard Piers Rayner. An instance of the direct influence is the scene in which Michael Jr. looks up at the Chicago skyline from the vehicle, with the skyline reflected in the vehicle's glass. A seamless 40-second driving scene, in which Michael Sullivan and his son travel into Chicago from the countryside, was aided by visual effects. The live-action part of the scene was filmed at LaSalle Street, and due to the lack of scenery for part of the drive down LaSalle Street, the background of Balbo Drive was included with the use of visual effects."

Sullivan, who chooses his violent path early on in life, considers himself irredeemable and seeks to save his son from a similar fate. Said Mendes, \"[Sullivan] is in a battle for the soul of his son. Can a man who has led a bad life achieve redemption through his child?\" Hanks described Sullivan as a man who achieved a comfortable status through violent means, whose likely repercussions he ignored. Sullivan is a good father and husband, but also has a job that requires him to be a violent killer. The film explores this paradoxical dichotomy. When Sullivan is faced with the consequences, Hanks says, \"At the moment we're dropped into the story, it is literally the last day of that false perspective.\" To keep Sullivan from justifying his violent actions in the film, Mendes omitted scenes in the final cut that had Sullivan explaining his background to his son. In the film, most of the numerous acts of violence are committed off-screen. The violent acts were also designed to be quick, reflecting the actual speed of violence in the real world. The focus was not on the direct victims of the perpetuated violence, but the impact of violence on the perpetrators or witnesses to the act."

Sullivan simultaneously idolizes and fears Rooney, and Sullivan's son feels the same about his own father. Rooney's son, Connor, has none of Sullivan's redeeming qualities, and Rooney is conflicted about whom to protect: his biological son or his surrogate son. Connor is jealous of his father's relationship with Sullivan, which fuels his actions, ultimately causing a domino effect that drives the film. Because Sullivan shields his background from his son, his attempt to preserve the father-son relationship is actually harmful. Tragedy brings Sullivan and his son together. Sullivan escapes from the old world with his son, and the boy finds an opportunity to strengthen the relationship with his father. Tyler Hoechlin, who portrayed Michael Jr., explained, \"His dad starts to realize that Michael is all he has now and how much he's been missing.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale. Reviewer James Berardinelli, on his own ReelViews web site, praised Road to Perdition for its atmosphere and visuals, but he considered an emotional attachment to be lacking except for Sullivan's son. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised Hall's cinematography and the thematic use of water. He, too, felt an emotional detachment from the characters, saying, \"I knew I admired it, but I didn't know if I liked it ... It is cold and holds us outside.\" Eleanor Ringel Gillespie of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution enjoyed the film's cinematography and Depression-era setting, as well as the performances of Hanks and Newman. Gillespie expressed the wish that the film lasted a little longer to explore its emotional core further. Eric Harrison of the Houston Chronicle considered Road to Perdition \"the most brilliant work in this [gangster] genre\" since the uncut Once Upon a Time in America (1984). Harrison considered Self's script \"so finely honed that the story can change directions in a heartbeat.\" Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised Hanks, Newman, and Craig but called Law's performance \"almost cartoonish\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also complimented Hanks and Newman: \"[They] act together with the confidence of titans, their talents in the service of character, never star ego.\" Travers cited Hall's \"breathtaking\" cinematography and composer Thomas Newman's \"evocative\" score. Paul Clinton of CNN said: \"While these deeply human issues are touched upon, they're never fully explored, and that undermines the sense of greatness to which this movie obviously aspires\". Clinton considered Craig's character \"one-dimensional to the extreme\". He found the cinematography too overpowering for the film's storyline, which he considered \"weak\". J. Hoberman of The Village Voice described the film as \"grim yet soppy.\" He added: \"The action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed.\" Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post thought that the script lost its path when Sullivan and his son fled their old life."

The cinematography was by Douglas Slocombe. Murphy's War is set in South America, in the backwaters of the global conflict (World War 2).  it focuses on a stubborn survivor of a sunken merchant ship who is consumed in his quest for revenge and retribution against the German submarine which had sunk his ship. It is one of a series of novels and/or films from the period following broadly similar themes about personal or community resistance to Nazi forces, and the moral relevance between them, including famous novels like The Secret of Santa Vittoria along with less recognized works like Kramer's War, and others."

        "content": "In the closing days of World War II, Irish crewman Murphy (Peter O'Toole) is the sole survivor of the crew of a merchant ship, Mount Kyle, which had been sunk by a German U-boat and the survivors machine-gunned in the water. Murphy makes it ashore to a missionary settlement on the Orinoco in Venezuela where he is treated by a pacifist Quaker doctor, Dr Hayden (Si\u00e2n Phillips). When he discovers the U-boat is hiding farther up river under the cover of the jungle, he sets about obsessively plotting to sink it by any means, including using a surviving Grumman J2F Duck floatplane from the Mount Kyle. The floatplane had been recovered, but the wounded pilot later being shot dead in his hospital bed by the U-boat captain in order to preserve the secret of the sub's location and, presumably, their war-crimes actions in shooting survivors in the water. Murphy learns how to fly the aircraft in the most daring way, getting it out on the choppy waters of the river and discovering how the controls work by trial and error. Murphy soon finds the U-boat's hiding place and attempts to bomb it using home-made Molotov cocktail bombs, which fails and leads to the mission settlement being destroyed in retaliation. Later, word comes that Germany has surrendered, but Murphy is obsessed with revenge and makes plans to ram the U-boat with a floating crane owned by the friendly Frenchman, Louis (Philippe Noiret). This also fails as the U-boat dives under him. However, the submerged U-boat becomes stuck in a mud bank. Murphy uses the crane to recover an unexploded torpedo fired earlier from the U-boat and drops it on the trapped crew, killing them. Murphy is also killed as the explosion from the torpedo causes the crane jib to pin him to the deck as the floating crane sinks to the river bed."

        "content": "Murphy is one of his ship's officers in the novel, but his film counterpart is a mechanic for the seaplane. The character of Lieutenant Ellis is not featured in the novel. Dr. Hayden is a composite of several doctors from the novel. Louis is a self-loathing deserter from the French military in the book, as opposed to his portrayal as a jovial company man in the film. The submarine crew as a whole is portrayed more sympathetically in the novel. Most of them are war weary and apolitical, save for Lieutenant Voght, who seizes command and carries out the murder of Murphy's crew while the captain is incapacitated from a head wound. The ending of the book is radically different. Murphy's dropping of the torpedo splits the sub in half and inadvertently allows most of the trapped crewmen - who'd been suffering from oxygen deprivation - to swim to the surface and survive. An injured Vought does not make it to shore and is carried away by the current to his death. Murphy also manages to avoid going down with the crane. Murphy and Captain Lauchs briefly fight each other on the beach, before sinking to the ground in mutual exhaustion."

        "content": "Peter Yates wanted to make the film. In 1969 Frank Sinatra was going to star but he dropped out Paramount Pictures agreed to provide half the finance of the film in exchange for world distribution rights. The other half of the budget came from London Screenplays, a finance company. Michael Deeley says that he and Peter Yates turned down the chance to make The Godfather (1972) to make this film. Director Yates said he was particularly interested in \"the way in which three people \u2014 Murphy, a doctor and a Frenchman left in the backwash of war \u2014 are really brought together by circumstance and how each character plays on the other and makes them do things that they wish they hadn't and things they sometimes feel proud of.\" Si\u00e2n Phillips, who played the love interest, was appearing opposite her then-husband O'Toole. The married couple had previously appeared together in the 1964 film Becket and the 1969 musical film Goodbye, Mr. Chips. Filming began on 23 February 1970, and was completed with location filming in Malta on 5 July, having filmed at a number of locations in the regions of Puerto Ordaz and Castillos de Guayana on the Orinoco River in Venezuela, as well as set filming at Pinewood Studios, Iver Heath and Twickenham Film Studios, Middlesex, England . Deeley described the shoot as the toughest of his career and it led to the breakup of his partnership with Peter Yates, with whom he had made several films. The scenes filmed in Malta depict the burning of the merchant ship, after it has been torpedoed by the U-boat. For these particular scenes O'Toole was called upon to swim through water afire with oil and with explosives going off right and left of him. \"I used to do all my own stunts when I first started\" he said. \"I made it a principle. Everything in Lawrence of Arabia I did myself. But after suffering a paralyzed hand, a bad back, broken ankle and countless knocks, I decided never again. It was stupid. Films employ stunt men (for a reason!). They can do these things far better than I. I refused to do any more stunts. [Then] I thought, well, just one more time. So I talked myself into it. In Venezuela I even fly a seaplane. If you want to see a picture of sheer terror have a look at the shots of me when I first fly that seaplane.\" Several of the sequences were extraordinarily photographed by Douglas Slocombe, including the scenes of Murphy piloting the floatplane and the visuals along the Orinoco River. Especially notable is a spectacular airborne shot of a flock of scarlet ibises in flight along the shore of the river during the closing credits. The extensive flying scene involves many shots of the floatplane veering sharply to avoid buildings, the jungle and stalling \u2013 for that sequence, a camera was strapped to the wing of the aircraft. Several Peace Corps volunteers serving in towns near the Orinoco River were recruited to play Nazi submariners. The volunteers donated their daily wages to the Venezuelan school districts or other organizations with whom they were working at the time. The Type IX U-boat was portrayed by the Venezuelan Navy's ARV Carite (S-11); this was the former , which had been sold to Venezuela in 1960. The floating crane was a former World War II tank landing craft. The OA-12 Duck  used in the film was restored and flown by Frank Tallman and is on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. In the original book, the aircraft was a Fairey Swordfish."

Roger Greenspun's review in The New York Times centered on the awkwardness of the plot: \"The sense of a film in which nothing quite works with anything else pervades 'Murphy's War,' and it extends from such crucial technical details as the sloppy and finally tedious cross-cutting between things (the seaplane, the motor barge, etc.) and the people who are supposed to be operating them, to the playing together of the principal actors.\" A review in Variety stated, \"By no means a film classic, 'Murphy's War' stands out as the kind of good, solid entertainment needed these days to fill houses.\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two stars out of four and called it \"an adventure story high in production values but low in suspense.\" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"The story proceeds from the detestable to the improbable by way of the uninteresting. Rarely will you see a major motion picture so flat and devoid of tone or atmosphere. O'Toole's performance is all flash mannerisms and unintelligibly gargled accents.\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post called it \"a dim, self-defeating adventure movie\" with a screenplay \"at peculiar cross-purposes with itself ... when the German surrender is announced, the script turns on feisty, vengeful sailor Murphy. All of a sudden it's about the madness of the plan to sink the sub, which, unfortunately, happens to be the raison d'etre of the movie.\" Although's O'Toole's performance was praised, another review in The New York Daily News called the film a \"sluggish action spectacle.\""

As \"everybody knows the Moon is made of cheese\", they decide to build a rocket and fly to the Moon. Upon arrival, they begin sampling and gathering cheese, later encountering a coin-operated robot. Wallace inserts a coin, but nothing happens. After he and Gromit leave, the robot comes to life and gathers the dirty plates left at their picnic spot. The robot discovers Wallace's skiing magazine,  and yearns to travel to Earth to ski for itself. It repairs a broken piece of Moon that Wallace had cut off, issues a parking ticket for the rocket, and becomes annoyed by an oil leakage from the craft. The robot sneaks up on Wallace and prepares to strike him, but the money Wallace inserted runs out, and it freezes. Wallace takes the robot's baton as a souvenir, inserts another coin, and prepares to leave with Gromit and the cheese they have gathered. Returning to life, the robot realizes Wallace and Gromit can bring it to Earth, and follows them. Wallace panics, and he and Gromit retreat into the rocket. Unable to climb up the ladder, the robot cuts into the fuselage using a can opener. Upon entering the dark engine section of the rocket, it lights a match and accidentally ignites some fuel. The resultant explosion throws it off the rocket, and Wallace and Gromit lift off. Initially distraught at losing its chance to go to Earth, the robot fashions discarded rocket fuselage into skis, and skis across the lunar landscape.

In 1985, Aardman Animations took him on before he finished the piece, allowing him to work on it part-time while still being funded by the school. To make the film, Park wrote to William Harbutt's company, requesting  of Plasticine. The block he received had ten colours, one of which was called \"stone\"; this was used for Gromit. Park wanted to voice Gromit, but he realised the voice he had in mind\u00a0\u2014 that of Peter Hawkins\u00a0\u2014 would have been difficult to animate. For Wallace, Park offered Peter Sallis \u00a350 to voice the character, and the actor's acceptance greatly surprised the young animator. Park wanted Wallace to have a Lancastrian accent like his own, but Sallis could only do a Yorkshire voice. Inspired by how Sallis drew out the word \"cheese\", Park chose to give Wallace large cheeks. When Park called Sallis six years later to explain he had completed his film, Sallis swore in surprise. Gromit was named after grommets, because Park's brother, an electrician, often mentioned them, and Nick Park liked the sound of the word. Wallace was originally a postman named Jerry, but Park felt the name did not match well with Gromit. Park saw an overweight Labrador Retriever named Wallace, who belonged to an old woman boarding a bus in Preston. Park commented it was a \"funny name, a very northern name to give a dog\". According to the book The World of Wallace and Gromit, original plans were that the film would be forty minutes long, including a sequence where Wallace and Gromit would discover a fast food restaurant on the Moon.

Meyer said Richard Zanuck, head of Fox, gave him a weekend to come up with an idea of how it could be done \"stressing budget strongly in line with the whole ideas of making movies more cheaply\" and encouraging him to \"make an R film smashing against an X rating.\""

        "content": "Meyer says he and Ebert wrote a 127-page treatment in 10 days and the script in three weeks. Neither of them had read the novel but they watched the 1967 film and used the same formula: \"Three young girls come to Hollywood, find fame and fortune, are threatened by sex, violence, and drugs, and either do or do not win redemption,\" according to Ebert. He later added: \"We would include some of the sensational elements of the original story- homosexuality, crippling diseases, characters based on 'real' people, events out of recent headlines- but, again, with flat-out exaggeration.\" The script was not only a spoof of the original film, but also, in Ebert's words, \"a satire of Hollywood conventions, genres, situations, dialogue, characters, and success formulas, heavily overlaid with such shocking violence that some critics didn't know whether the movie 'knew' it was a comedy\". Ebert said the plot was derived in collaboration \"by creating characters and then working out situations to cover the range of exploitable content we wanted in the film. Meyer wanted the film to appeal, in some way, to almost anyone who was under thirty and went to the movies. There had to be music, mod clothes, black characters, violence, romantic love, soap opera situations, behind-the-scenes intrigue, fantastic sets, lesbians, orgies, drugs and (eventually) an ending that tied everything together.\" Meyer's intention was for the film to \"simultaneously be a satire, a serious melodrama, a rock musical, a comedy, a violent exploitation picture, a skin flick, and a moralistic expose (so soon after the Sharon Tate murders) of what the opening crawl called 'the oft-times nightmarish world of Show Business'\"."

But in hindsight I can recognize that the conditions of its making were almost miraculous. An independent X-rated filmmaker and an inexperienced screenwriter were brought into a major studio and given carte blanche to turn out a satire of one of the studio's own hits. And BVD was made at a time when the studio's own fortunes were so low that the movie was seen almost fatalistically, as a gamble that none of the more respectable studio executives really wanted to think about, so that there was a minimum of supervision (or even cognizance) from the Front Office. Meyer submitted the script to Richard Zanuck at Fox in September and Zanuck greenlit the film. Meyer said when Fox offered him the film \"I felt like I had pulled off the biggest caper in the world.\" He described the film as \"a soap opera for young people, a cornocopia of wild, way-out now entertainment.\""

        "content": "Roger Ebert revealed that many of the film's themes and characters were based upon real people and events, but because neither Ebert nor Russ Meyer actually met these people, their characterizations were based on pure speculation. Ronnie \"Z-Man\" Barzell \u2013 The fictional eccentric rock producer turned Carrie Nations manager was loosely based on real-life producer Phil Spector. More than three decades later, Spector was convicted of murder after the body of Lana Clarkson was found at his mansion, which is somewhat reminiscent of the events of the film's climax. Randy Black \u2013 The heavyweight champ character was loosely based on the real World Heavyweight Champion Muhammad Ali. The climactic, violent ending, which was not in the original script, was inspired by the real-life Tate-LaBianca murders perpetrated by members of the Manson Family. The film began production on December 2, 1969, shortly after the murders, which were covered heavily by the media. Valley of the Dolls star Sharon Tate was among the murder victims, as was Jay Sebring. Vocalist Lynn Carey, who was dating Sebring and had been invited to join him the night of the Tate-LaBianca murders, refused his invitation, according to her comments on the DVD extras. Porter Hall \u2013 This scheming lawyer shares the name of a character actor who often played movie villains. Susan Lake and Baxter Wolfe were, in an original draft script, Anne Welles and Lyon Burke from Valley of the Dolls. Their back-story stated in BVD (\"He proposed to her but it was the wrong time\", \"It's been three years...\"), matches the ending of the original. Following Jacqueline Susann's legal-action proceedings against 20th Century Fox, the characters were renamed and recast. Barbara Parkins, who played Anne, was originally under contract to appear in BVD and was disappointed when she was abruptly removed from the project. The special edition DVD features a screen test with Michael Blodgett and Cynthia Myers enacting the bedroom scene between Lance and Kelly. Obviously based on an early script, the dialogue has them make reference to Anne Welles, not Susan Lake, as Kelly's Aunt."

        "content": "Meyer and Ebert kept the costs down by writing \"97 percent of the film\" for existing sets on the Fox backlot. Ebert said that Beyond the Valley of the Dolls seemed \"like a movie that got made by accident when the lunatics took over the asylum\". Ebert says Meyer \"directed his actors with a poker face, solemnly discussing the motivations behind each scene. Some of the actors asked me whether their dialogue wasn't supposed to be humorous, but Meyer discussed it so seriously with them that they hesitated to risk offending him by voicing such a suggestion. The result is that BVD has a curious tone all of its own... from actors directed at right angles to the material.\" Because the film was put together so quickly, some plot decisions, such as the character Z-Man being revealed as a woman in drag, were made on the spot, without the chance to bring previous already-shot scenes into alignment with the new development. As they were shooting, the cast was uncertain whether the dialogue was intended to be comic or not, which would alter their approach to acting it. Because Meyer always discussed their roles and the film so seriously, they did not want to unintentionally insult him by asking, so they broached the question to Ebert, instead. Meyer's intention was to have the actors perform the material in a straightforward manner, saying \"If the actors perform as if they know they have funny lines, it won't work.\" Ebert described the resulting tone as \"curious\". In 1980, Ebert looked back on the film and said of it: I think of it as an essay on our generic expectations. It's an anthology of stock situations, characters, dialogue, clich\u00e9s and stereotypes, set to music and manipulated to work as exposition and satire at the same time; it's cause and effect, a wind-up machine to generate emotions, pure movie without message."

Members of the fictitious Carrie Nations neither sing nor play their own instruments in the film. Vocals for the lip-synced songs were performed by Lynn Carey (Mama Lion), a blue-eyed soul singer based in Los Angeles, together with Barbara Robison, the lead singer of Peanut Butter Conspiracy. Carey's and Robison's voices are showcased on the apocalyptic rocker \"Find It\" (by Stu Phillips and Carey), the earnest folk anthem \"Come With the Gentle People\" (by Stu Phillips and Bob Stone), the raunchy R&B of \"Sweet Talking Candyman\" (by Phillips and Stone), the lilting ballad \"In the Long Run\" (by Phillips and Stone), and the soulful strut of \"Look On Up At the Bottom\" (also by Phillips and Stone). She also sings \"Once I had Love\", written by Stu Phillips and herself. Strawberry Alarm Clock performed their 1967 hit \"Incense and Peppermints\", the mid-tempo rocker \"Girl from the City\" (written by Paul Marshall), and the power pop anthem \"I'm Comin' Home\" (also by Marshall) during the first party scene at Z-Man's house. The film's title song was performed by A&M artists The Sandpipers and is heard twice near the end of the movie. The group released the song as a single and on their 1970 Come Saturday Morning LP. Different versions of the soundtrack album exist because of disputes over royalties. The original vinyl soundtrack, reissued in the early 2000s, substitutes Ami Rushes' vocals for Lynn Carey's originals, and includes one song, \"Once I Had Love\", not on the 2003 CD reissue. However, the CD edition of the soundtrack (Soundtrack Classics SCL 1408 and Harkit Records HRKCD 8032) contains 25 songs compared to the 12 songs on the vinyl version, with the original film versions plus Lynn Carey and Barbara Robison bonus tracks. Both labels also released vinyl editions with different covers and extended songs compared to the 1970 LP. The song \"Once I Had A Love\" was released on the CD Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls/Groupie Girl (Screen Gold Records SGLDCD00010) along with the songs from the LP from 1970. The CD does not contain the original film versions, only the new recordings for the LP from 1970, with four songs by Ami Rushes and two by Barbara Robison. For the first time, all original film song versions are included, with original versions sung by Carey and Robison. \"Incense and Peppermints\", some incidental music, and the Strawberry Alarm Clock's Hammond organ instrumental \"Toy Boy\" are missing from all soundtrack releases."

Boredom aplenty is provided by a screenplay which for some reason has been turned over to a screenwriting neophyte.\" He later put it on his list of the 20 worst films of the year. Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that the film \"comes off with a slightly higher rating\" than the original Valley of the Dolls book and movie, but thought that by \"quite consciously attempting to parody his earlier movies\" Meyer had \"become patronizing.\" Variety wrote that it was \"not much of a film. Producer-director Russ Meyer, who once made low-budget sex pix which had a crude and innocuous charm but not much of a story, this time around spent between 20 and 30 times the money he used to have, and got less for it.\" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times panned the film as \"a treat for the emotionally retarded, sexually inadequate and dimwitted. It is a grievously sick melange of hypermammalian girls, obvious double-entendres and sadistic violence.\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post declared it \"a mess, a disaster, a stinkeroo, the most wretched of wretched movies,\" adding, \"Disregard anything you hear in the so-bad-it's-good or it's-all-a-put-on veins. It's a depressing picture \u2014 witless, hysterical, gratuitous, technically inept, needlessly brutal.\" Mike Wallington of The Monthly Film Bulletin called it \"corny, moralising, guileless, and visually about as appealing as a Christmas wrapper. It is also perversely enjoyable if one is prepared to laugh at it as well as with it.\" John Waters has expressed admiration for the film citing it as \"one of the best movies ever made.\" Since its release in 1970, the film has acquired a cult following and has even been included in various \"best of\" lists by movie critics. The reviews have improved to become more mixed at the present, with critics agreeing it was much better than the film it parodied. In 2000, Canadian magazine Take One included it in their \"Best Films of the 1970s\" critics poll. In 2001, the Village Voice named the film #87 on its list of the 100 Greatest Films of the Century. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 77% from 30 reviews. The critical consensus reads: \"Confidently campy and played with groovy conviction, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls is an exuberant expression of both the hilarity and terror that comes with free love.\""

Priya's father Amalraj is a widower and a clothing industrialist who expects Priya to look after his business but her main ambition is to become a nun. Amalraj tries to stop this by unsuccessfully trying to arrange a wedding alliance for Priya. Thomas, a non-resident Indian, returns to India after his studies to look after his father James' business. James, a former associate of Amalraj, had set up his clothing business opposite Amalraj's factory. Amalraj dislikes James due to his boorish and clumsy attitude, even though Thomas and Priya are childhood friends. Priya, after several years at the convent, unexpectedly meets Thomas, who is visiting his aunt, the Mother Superior of the convent. He takes Priya's help in surprising his aunt with a gift on her birthday, and falls in love with Priya but is unable to tell her. Thomas is shocked when finds out about Priya's ambition to become a nun; he approaches a hairstylist named Deva, who is known for his ability to change women's minds, to stop her ambition. Deva is hesitant but accepts. Deva and his friend, a blind,  aspiring musician named Guru, befriend Priya and persuade her to join their music troupe. Priya's singing talent helps the troupe gain recognition and they are approached to audition for a film. Deva, Guru, and the rest of the troupe play tricks to make Priya fall in love with Thomas.

The Gargon Terror (UK title), The Boy from Outer Space, and originally titled The Ray Gun Terror) is a 1959 American independent black-and-white science fiction cult film released by Warner Bros. The film was produced, written, and directed by Tom Graeff and stars David Love, Dawn Bender, Bryan Grant, Harvey B. Dunn, Tom Graeff, and King Moody. Teenagers from Outer Space was distributed theatrically by Warner Bros. on a double feature with Gigantis the Fire Monster, the English-dubbed version of the 1955 Japanese giant monster film Godzilla Raids Again. In the film, a young alien named Derek abandons his crew to search for a new life on Earth, while one of his crewmates is sent to find him as they attempt to eradicate human life in order to farm Earth with giant lobster-like livestock they call Gargons. In 1987, the film entered the public domain in the United States because Warner Bros. did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication."

        "content": "A flying saucer arrives on Earth while searching for planets suitable to raise \"Gargons\", a lobster-like but air-breathing monster that is a delicacy on their home planet. Crewman Thor shows his alien contempt for Earth's creatures, by needlessly vaporizing a dog named Sparky with a disintegrator raygun. Another crew member by the name of Derek, discovers an inscription on Sparky's dog tag and fears the Gargons might destroy Earth's native inhabitants. This makes the other aliens scoff at the thought. Being members of the \"supreme race\", they disdain \"foreign beings\", no matter how intelligent; they pride themselves that \"families\" and \"friendships\" are forbidden on their world. Derek reveals an ancient book and turns out to be a member of an underground rebellion, that commemorates the more humane periods of their world's history. The Captain tricks him and Thor disarms Derek. Taking him as prisoner, they plan to put Derek on trial and have him executed by the high court. The Gargon they brought with them suddenly falls sick to Earth's atmosphere. While his crew members are distracted, Derek escapes on foot. Eventually, the Gargon revives from being unconscious. When the Captain gives his report, it is revealed that Derek is the son of the Leader of their race, although he is unaware of this. Thor is sent to hunt down Derek, with orders to bring him back alive or kill him and any other intelligent beings to protect their mission to Earth. The rest of the crew return to their homeworld, leaving the Gargon behind in a nearby cave. Meanwhile, Derek arrives at the address he found on the dog's tag, where he meets Betty Morgan and her Grandpa. They have a room to rent, and Derek inadvertently becomes a boarder. When Betty's friend, reporter Joe Rogers, cannot make it to their afternoon swim at Alice Woodward's place, Derek tags along with Betty. He shows the tag to Betty, who recognizes it immediately. Derek takes her to the place where the spacecraft landed and shows her Sparky's remains. She does not believe him, so he describes Thor's weapon that can also vaporize humans. Betty takes this surprisingly well and vows to help Derek stop his crewmate. For the rest of the day Betty and Derek have several run-ins with Thor, who vaporizes several humans, and Joe follows up on stories of skeletons popping up all over town. Eventually, Thor is wounded, after a shoot out with the police. And he kidnaps both Derek and Betty to help him receive medical attention, in the process revealing Derek's true parentage to them. Two car chases and a gunfight follow, and Thor is finally captured by Earth authorities after plummeting off a cliff in a stolen car. Shortly after, the Gargon grows immensely large, after killing and devouring a policeman investigating the alien's landing site, and attacking numerous people. Derek and Betty go to the car wreck site to look for Thor's raygun. They share a kiss, and Derek vows to stay on Earth. The Gargon suddenly appears and ruins their romantic moment, but Derek finds the raygun under a rock just in time for them to escape. Unfortunately, it is damaged and out of power. The giant Gargon begins heading towards the town. They follow and confront it, having used the electricity from the overhead power lines to fuel the raygun's components. Derek eventually kills the monster, but it's too late. The invading fleet appears in Earth's orbit. Derek retrieves Thor from the police and everyone, including Joe and Grandpa, hurry to the landing site. He then reunites with the Captain and meets his father for the first time. Derek pretends to feel regret for his insubordination and offers to help guide the spaceships to land. Derek then goes into the spacecraft alone and makes the ultimate sacrifice, leading the invasion fleet at full speed directly towards his ground location and causing a massive explosion, killing his father, the Captain and Thor in the process. Derek does not survive the blast but is remembered by Betty for declaring, \"I shall make the Earth my home. And I shall never, never leave it.\""

        "content": "According to Bryan Pearson, the crew employed many guerrilla tactics in order to cut costs. Director Tom Graeff secured for free the location used for Betty Morgan's house by posing as a UCLA student (which he had attended and graduated from 5 years earlier). The older woman who owned the house even let the crew use her electricity to power their equipment. Graeff shot in many nearby locations, mostly in the vicinity of Sunset Boulevard and Highland Avenue, that doubled as more important city landmarks. Graeff's steady hand and framing kept most of the real locations subdued, creating a convincing low-budget illusion of a small town. Other cost-cutting measures did not work as well: The aliens' costumes were simple flight suits clearly decorated with masking tape, dress shoes covered in socks, and surplus Air Force flight helmets. The use of stock footage, in lieu of real special effects and pre-Spielbergian \"looking\" shots that replaced actual visuals of the invading alien spaceships, seriously undercut the film's ending. Props included a single-bolted-joint skeleton re-used for every dead body seen on screen, a multi-channel sound mixer that was not camouflaged (clearly bearing the label \"Multichannel Mixer MCM-2\") as a piece of alien equipment, and a dime store Hubley's \"Atomic Disintegrator\" toy as the aliens' disintegrator ray gun."

        "content": "In June 1958 Bryan Pearson, who invested $5,000 in the production with his wife Ursula, took Graeff to court in order to gain back the original investment and a percentage of any profits. The Pearsons had learned that Graeff had allegedly sold the film (originally titled The Boy From Out of This World), which did not happen until early 1959. He heard nothing more on their investment or a percentage of profits to which they were entitled. The legal dispute dragged on for a year. Pearson received his $5,000 investment, but the judge ruled there was no profit to share. Tom and the Pearsons, who had been good friends during the production of Teenagers, never spoke to each other again. The film failed to perform at the box office, placing further stress on an already-burdened Graeff, and in the fall of 1959, he suffered a breakdown, proclaiming himself as the second coming of Christ. After a number of public appearances, followed by a subsequent arrest for disrupting a church service, Graeff disappeared from Hollywood until 1964. He committed suicide in 1970. The film went on to become a cult classic among sci-fi fans and was later shown on Mystery Science Theater 3000, Elvira's Movie Macabre, and Off Beat Cinema. It was also included in the video game Destroy All Humans! It becomes unlocked and ready to play in full once the player beats the game."

It was suspected that Byron De La Beckwith, a white supremacist, was the murderer. He had been tried twice and both trials ended in hung juries.  Evers' widow Myrlie Evers had been trying to bring De La Beckwith to justice for over 25 years. In 1989, emboldened by a newspaper article by Jerry Mitchell exposing jury tampering by the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission in the first two trials, Myrlie Evers believed she had what it takes to bring him to trial again. Although most of the evidence from the old trial had disappeared, Bobby DeLaughter, an assistant District Attorney, decided to help her despite being warned that it might hurt his political aspirations and despite the strain that it caused in his marriage. DeLaughter becomes primarily involved with bringing De La Beckwith to trial for the third time 30 years later. In 1994, Byron De La Beckwith was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. The film ends with Myrlie tearfully rejoicing to the assembled crowd that she never gave up in the fight for justice for Medger."

        "content": "Don't Look Now (, lit. \"In Venice... a shocking red December\") is a 1973 English-language film in the thriller genre directed by Nicolas Roeg, adapted from the 1971 short story by Daphne du Maurier. Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland portray Laura and John Baxter, a married couple who travel to Venice following the recent accidental death of their daughter, after John accepts a commission to restore a church. They encounter two sisters, one of whom claims to be clairvoyant and informs them that their daughter is trying to contact them and warn them of danger. John at first dismisses their claims, but starts to experience mysterious sightings himself. Don't Look Now focuses on the psychology of grief and the effect the death of a child can have on a relationship. The film is renowned for its innovative editing style, recurring motifs and themes, and for a controversial sex scene that was explicit by the standards of contemporary mainstream cinema. It also employs flashbacks and flashforwards in keeping with the depiction of precognition, but some scenes are intercut or merged to alter the viewer's perception of what is really happening. It adopts an impressionist approach to its imagery, often presaging events with familiar objects, patterns and colours using associative editing techniques. The film's reputation has grown in the years since its release and it is now considered a classic and an influential work in horror and British film."

        "content": "Sometime after the drowning of their young daughter Christine (Sharon Williams) in an accident at their English country home, John Baxter (Donald Sutherland) and his grief-stricken wife Laura (Julie Christie) travel to Venice where John has accepted a commission from a bishop (Massimo Serato) to restore an ancient church. Laura encounters two elderly sisters, Heather (Hilary Mason) and Wendy (Clelia Matania), at a restaurant where she and John are dining; Heather claims to be psychic and\u2014despite being blind\u2014informs Laura she is able to \"see\" the Baxters' deceased daughter. Shaken, Laura returns to her table, then faints. Laura is taken to the hospital, where she later tells John what Heather told her.  John is sceptical but pleasantly surprised by the positive change in Laura's demeanour. After returning from the hospital, John and Laura have passionate sex later that evening. Afterwards, they go out to dinner where they get lost and briefly become separated. John catches a glimpse of what appears to be a small child (Adelina Poerio) wearing a red coat similar to the one Christine was wearing when she died. The next day, Laura meets with Heather and Wendy, who hold a s\u00e9ance to try to contact Christine. When she returns to the hotel, Laura informs John that Christine said he is in danger and must leave Venice. John loses his temper with Laura, but that night they receive a telephone call informing them that their son (Nicholas Salter) has been injured in an accident at his boarding school. Laura departs for England, while John stays on to complete the restoration. Shortly afterward, John is nearly killed in an accident at the church when the scaffolding collapses, and he interprets this as the \"danger\" foretold by the sisters. Later that day and under the assumption that Laura is in England, John is shocked when he spots her on a passing boat that is part of a funeral cortege, accompanied by the two sisters. Concerned about his wife's mental state and with reports of a serial killer at large in Venice, John reports Laura's seeming disappearance to the police. The inspector (Renato Scarpa) investigating the killings is suspicious of John and has him followed. After conducting a futile search for Laura and the sisters\u2014during which he again sees the childlike figure in the red coat\u2014John contacts his son's school to enquire about his condition, only to discover that Laura is already there. After speaking to her to confirm she really is in England, a bewildered John returns to the police station to inform the police he has found his wife.  In the meantime, the police have brought Heather in for questioning and an apologetic John offers to escort her back to the hotel. Shortly after returning to the hotel, Heather slips into a trance. John makes his excuses and quickly leaves. Upon coming out of the trance, Heather pleads with her sister to go after John, sensing that something terrible is about to happen, but Wendy is unable to catch up with him. Meanwhile, John catches another glimpse of the mysterious figure in red and this time pursues it. He corners the figure in a deserted palazzo and approaches, believing them to be a child. Instead, it is revealed to be a hideous female dwarf, and while John is frozen in shock the dwarf pulls out a meat cleaver and cuts his throat. Dying, John realises too late that the strange sightings he experienced were premonitions of his own murder and funeral."

        "title": "Don't Look Now_Themes",
        "content": "Don't Look Now is an occult-themed thriller in which the conventions of the Gothic ghost story serve to explore the minds of a grief-stricken couple. The film's director, Nicolas Roeg, was intrigued by the idea of making \"grief into the sole thrust of the film\", noting that \"Grief can separate people ... Even the closest, healthiest relationship can come undone through grief.\" The presence of Christine, the Baxters' deceased daughter, weighs heavily on the mood of the film, as she and the nature of her death are constantly recalled through the film's imagery: there are regular flashbacks to Christine playing in her red coat as well as the sightings of the mysterious childlike figure also wearing a red coat which bears a likeness to her; the constant association of water with death is maintained via a serial-killer sub-plot, which sees victims periodically dragged from the canals; there is also a poignant moment when John fishes a child's doll out of a canal just as he did with his daughter's body at the beginning of the film. The associative use of recurring motifs, combined with unorthodox editing techniques, foreshadows key events in the film.  In Daphne du Maurier's novella it is Laura that wears a red coat, but in the film the colour is used to establish an association between Christine and the elusive figure that John keeps catching glimpses of.  Du Maurier's story actually opens in Venice following Christine's death from meningitis, but the decision was taken to change the cause of death to drowning and to include a prologue to exploit the water motif. The threat of death from falling is also ever present throughout the film: besides Christine falling into the lake, Laura is taken to hospital after her fall in the restaurant, their son Johnny is injured in a fall at boarding school, the bishop overseeing the church restoration informs John that his father was killed in a fall, and John himself is nearly killed in a fall during the renovations. Glass is frequently used as an omen that something bad is about to occur: just before Christine drowns, John knocks a glass of water over, and Johnny breaks a pane of glass; as Laura faints in the restaurant she knocks glassware off the table, and when John almost falls to his death in the church, a plank of wood shatters a pane of glass; finally, shortly before confronting the mysterious red clad figure, John asks the sisters for a glass of water, a piece of symbolism that prefigured Christine's death. The plot of the film is preoccupied with misinterpretation and mistaken identity: when John sees Laura on the barge with the sisters, he fails to realise it is a premonition and believes Laura is in Venice with them. John himself is mistaken for a Peeping Tom when he follows Laura to the s\u00e9ance, and ultimately he mistakes the mysterious red-coated figure for a child. The concept of Doppelg\u00e4nger and duplicates feature prominently in the film: reproductions are a constantly recurring motif ranging from reflections in the water, to photographs, to police sketches and the photographic slides of the church John is restoring. Laura comments in a letter to their son that she can't tell the difference between the restored church windows and the \"real thing\", and later in the film John attempts to make a seamless match between recently manufactured tiles and the old ones in repairing an ancient mosaic. Roeg describes the basic premise of the story as principally being that in life \"nothing is what it seems\", and even decided to have Donald Sutherland's character utter the line\u2014a scene which required fifteen takes. Communication is a theme that runs through much of Nicolas Roeg's work, and figures heavily in Don't Look Now.  This is best exemplified by the blind psychic woman, Heather, who communicates with the dead, but it is presented in other ways: the language barriers are purposefully enhanced by the decision to not include subtitles translating the Italian dialogue into English, so the viewer experiences the same confusion as John. Women are presented as better at communicating than men: besides the clairvoyant being female, it is Laura who stays in regular contact with their son, Johnny;  when the Baxters receive a phone call informing them of Johnny's accident at the boarding school, the headmaster's inarticulateness in explaining the situation causes his wife to intercept and explain instead. Much has been made of the fragmented editing of Don't Look Now, and Nicolas Roeg's work in general. Time is presented as 'fluid', where the past, present and future can all exist in the same timeframe.  John's premonitions merge with the present, such as at the start of the film where the mysterious red-coated figure is seemingly depicted in one of his photographic slides, and when he 'sees' Laura on the funeral barge with the sisters and mistakenly believes he is seeing the present, but in fact it is a vision of the future. The most famous use of this fragmented approach to time is during the love scene, in which the scenes of John and Laura having sex are intercut with scenes of them dressing afterwards to go out to dinner. After John is attacked by his assailant in the climactic moments, the preceding events depicted during the course of the film are recalled through flashback, which may be perceived as his life flashing before his eyes. At a narrative level the plot of Don't Look Now can be regarded as a self-fulfilling prophecy: it is John's premonitions of his death that set in motion the events leading up to his death. According to the editor of the film, Graeme Clifford, Nicolas Roeg regarded the film as his \"exercise in film grammar\"."

        "title": "Don't Look Now_Inspirations",
        "content": "Don't Look Now is particularly indebted to Alfred Hitchcock, exhibiting several characteristics of the director's work. The aural match cut following Christine's death from Laura's scream to the screech of a drill is reminiscent of a cut in The 39 Steps, when a woman's scream cuts to the whistle of a steam train. When John reports Laura's disappearance to the Italian police he inadvertently becomes a suspect in the murder case they are investigating\u2014an innocent man being wrongly accused and pursued by the authorities is a common Hitchcock trait. The film also takes a Hitchcockian approach to its mise en sc\u00e8ne, by manifesting its protagonist's psychology in plot developments: in taking their trip to Venice the Baxters have run away from personal tragedy, and are often physically depicted as running to and from things during their stay in Venice; the labyrinthine geography of Venice causes John to lose his bearings, and he often becomes separated from Laura and is repeatedly shown to be looking for her\u2014both physical realisations of what is going on in his head. Nicolas Roeg had employed the fractured editing style of Don't Look Now on his previous films, Performance and Walkabout, but it was originated by editor Antony Gibbs on Petulia. Roeg served as the cinematographer on Petulia, which incidentally also starred Julie Christie, and Gibbs went on to edit Performance and Walkabout for Roeg. Roeg's use of colour\u2014especially red\u2014can be traced back to earlier work: both Performance and Walkabout feature scenes where the whole screen turns red, similar in nature to the scene during Christine's drowning when the spilt water on the church slide causes a reaction that makes it\u2014along with the whole screen\u2014turn completely red. The mysterious red-coated figure and its association with death has a direct parallel with an earlier film Roeg worked on as cinematographer, The Masque of the Red Death, which depicted a red clad Grim Reaper character. The fleeting glimpses of the mysterious red-coated figure possibly draw on Proust: in Remembrance of Things Past, while in Venice, the narrator catches sight of a red gown in the distance which brings back painful memories of his lost love. Besides Proust, other possible literary influences include Borges and Nietzsche; Pauline Kael in her review comments that \"Roeg comes closer to getting Borges on the screen than those who have tried it directly\", while Mark Sanderson in his BFI Modern Classics essay on the film, finds parallels with Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil. The film's setting and production status has also drawn comparisons with giallo films, due to its structure, cinematic language and focus on the psychological makeup of its protagonists sharing many characteristics with the Italian subgenre, although Anya Stanley has noted that it lacks the exploitational portrayal of violence and sexuality typically associated with the form. In this regard, Danny Shipka has noted that Don't Look Now bears similarities to Aldo Lado's 1972 giallo Who Saw Her Die?, in which an estranged couple (George Lazenby and Anita Strindberg) investigate the drowning death of their daughter. In his view, Aldo \"eliminat[es] a lot of the extreme gore and sex [associated with gialli], but still manages to create an aura of uneasiness with his Venetian locales just as Roeg did a year later\"."

Although real-life couple Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner were suggested for the parts of Laura and John Baxter, Roeg was eager to cast Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland from the very start. Initially engaged by other projects, both actors unexpectedly became available.  Christie liked the script and was keen to work with Roeg, who had served as cinematographer on Fahrenheit 451, Far from the Madding Crowd and Petulia in which she had starred. Sutherland also wanted to make the film but had some reservations about the depiction of clairvoyance in the script. He felt it was handled too negatively and believed that Don't Look Now should be a more \"educative film\", and that the \"characters should in some way benefit from ESP and not be destroyed by it\". Roeg was resistant to any changes and issued Sutherland an ultimatum. Roeg wanted Julie Christie to attend a s\u00e9ance prior to filming. Leslie Flint, a direct voice medium based in Notting Hill, invited them to attend a session which he was holding for some American parapsychologists, who were coming over to observe him.  Roeg and Christie went along and sat in a circle in the pitch dark and joined hands. Flint instructed his guests to \"uncross\" their legs, which Roeg subsequently incorporated into the film. Adelina Poerio was cast as the fleeting red-coated figure after Roeg saw her photo at a casting session in Rome. Standing at only 4'2\" tall, she had a career as a singer. Renato Scarpa was cast as Inspector Longhi, despite not being able to speak English and so he had no idea what he was saying in the film."

        "content": "The drowning scene and house exteriors were filmed in Hertfordshire at the home of actor David Tree, who also plays the headmaster at the son's boarding school. Shooting the sequence was particularly problematic: Sharon Williams, who played Christine, became hysterical when submersed in the pond, despite the rehearsals at the swimming pool going well.  A farmer on the neighbouring land volunteered his daughter who was an accomplished swimmer, but who refused to be submersed when it came to filming. In the end, the scene was filmed in a water tank using three girls. Nicolas Roeg and editor Graeme Clifford showed the opening sequence to some friends before filming resumed on the Venice segment, and Clifford recalls it making a considerable impression. The Venice locations included the Hotel Gabrielli Sandwirth\u2014the lobby and exteriors standing in for the film's fictional Europa Hotel, although the Baxters' suite was located at the Bauer Grunwald (which better accommodated the cameras)\u2014and the San Nicol\u00f2 dei Mendicoli (the Church of St. Nicholas of the Beggars), located on the outskirts of Venice. Finding an appropriate church proved difficult: after visiting most of the churches in Venice, the Italian location manager suggested constructing one in a warehouse. The discovery of San Nicol\u00f2 was particularly fortuitous since it was currently being renovated and the scaffolding was already in place, the circumstances lending themselves well to the plot of the film. Roeg decided not to use traditional tourist locations to purposefully avoid a travel documentary look. Venice turned out to be a difficult place to film in, mainly due to the tides which caused problems with the continuity and transporting equipment. Filming the scene in which John almost falls to his death while restoring the mosaic in San Nicol\u00f2 church was also beset by problems, and resulted in Donald Sutherland's life being put in danger.  The scene entailed some of the scaffolding collapsing leaving John dangling by a rope, but the stuntman refused to perform the stunt because the insurance was not in order. Sutherland ended up doing it instead, and was attached to a kirby wire as a precaution in case he should fall. Some time after the film had come out, renowned stunt co-ordinator Vic Armstrong commented to Sutherland that the wire was not designed for that purpose, and the twirling around caused by holding on to the rope would have damaged the wire to the extent that it would have snapped if Sutherland had let go. While many of the changes were due to the logistics of filming in Venice, some were for creative reasons, the most prominent being the inclusion of the famous love scene.  The scene was in fact an unscripted last minute improvisation by Roeg, who felt that without it there would be too many scenes of the couple arguing. The scene set in the church where Laura lights a candle for Christine was mostly improvised too. Originally intended to show the gulf between John's and Laura's mental states\u2014John's denial and Laura's inability to let go\u2014the script included two pages of dialogue to illustrate John's unease at Laura's marked display of grief. After a break in filming to allow the crew to set up the equipment, Donald Sutherland returned to the set and commented that he did not like the church, to which Julie Christie retorted that he was being \"silly\", and the church was \"beautiful\". Roeg felt that the exchange was more true to life in terms of what the characters would actually say to each other, and that the scripted version was \"overwritten\", so opted to ditch the scripted dialogue and included the real-life exchange instead. The funeral scene at the end of the film was also played differently from what was originally intended. Julie Christie was supposed to wear a veil to hide her face, but prior to filming Roeg suggested to Christie that she should play it without the veil and smile throughout the scene. Christie was initially sceptical, but Roeg felt it would not make sense for the character to be heartbroken if she believed her husband and daughter were together in the afterlife."

        "content": "The score was composed by Pino Donaggio, a native Venetian who was a popular singer at the time (he had a hit with \"lo Che Non Vivo\" which was covered by Dusty Springfield in 1966 as \"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\"); prior to Don't Look Now, Donaggio had never scored a film. Ugo Mariotti, a casting director on the film, spotted Donaggio on a Vaporetto on the Grand Canal in Venice, and believing it to be a \"sign\", contacted him to see if he would be interested in working on the film. Donaggio was reluctant at first because he did not understand why they would be interested in someone who had no experience of scoring films. Donaggio had no interest in making soundtracks for films at the time, but was introduced to Nicolas Roeg who decided to try him out and asked him to write something for the beginning of the film. Roeg was enthusiastic about the result but the London-based producers were resistant to hiring someone who had no background in films. The film's financiers were pleased with Donaggio's work and overruled the producers. As well as composing the score, Donaggio performed a substantial portion of it himself. The piano pieces were performed by Donaggio, despite the fact that he was not very accomplished at playing the piano. The piano pieces are usually associated with Christine in the film, and Roeg wanted them to have an innocent sound reminiscent of a little girl learning to play the piano. Donaggio claims that since he was not very good at playing the piano, the pieces had an unsure style to them, perfect for the effect they were trying to capture. The only disagreement over the musical direction of the film was for the score accompanying the love scene.  Donaggio composed a grand orchestral piece, but Roeg thought the effect was overkill, and wanted it toned down. In the end the scene just used a combination of the piano, the flute, an acoustic guitar and an acoustic bass guitar. The piano was played by Donaggio again, who also played the flute; in contrast to his skill as a pianist, Donaggio was a renowned flautist, famous for it at the conservatory. Donaggio conceded that the more low-key theme worked better in the sequence and ditched the high strings orchestral piece, reworking it for the funeral scene at the end of the film. Donaggio won a \"best soundtrack of the year\" award for his work on the film, which gave him the confidence to quit his successful singing career and embark on a career scoring films. Donaggio became a regular composer for Brian De Palma, and credits Nicolas Roeg with giving him his first lesson in writing film scores, and expressed a desire to work with him again. Donaggio's score later achieved newfound recognition for its inclusion in the fourth episode of HBO series Euphoria; music supervisor Jen Malone noted that the cues used were the most difficult to obtain out of all of the music used in the series."

        "title": "Don't Look Now_Sex scene controversy",
        "content": "Don't Look Now has become famous for a sex scene involving Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland, which caused considerable controversy before its release in 1973. British tabloid newspaper, the Daily Mail, observed at the time \"one of the frankest love scenes ever to be filmed is likely to plunge lovely Julie Christie into the biggest censorship row since Last Tango in Paris\". The scene was unusually graphic for the period, including a rare depiction of cunnilingus in a mainstream film. Christie commented that \"people didn't do scenes like that in those days\", and that she found the scenes difficult to film: \"There were no available examples, no role models ... I just went blank and Nic [Roeg] shouted instructions.\" The scene caused problems with censors on both sides of the Atlantic.  The American censor advised Nicolas Roeg explicitly, saying, \"We cannot see humping. We cannot see the rise and fall between thighs.\" The scene's much celebrated fragmented style, in which scenes of the couple having sexual intercourse are intercut with scenes of the couple post-coitally getting dressed to go out to dinner, partly came about through Roeg's attempt to accommodate the concerns of the censors: \"They scrutinised it and found absolutely nothing they could object to. If someone goes up, you cut and the next time you see them they're in a different position, you obviously fill in the gaps for yourself. But, technically speaking, there was no 'humping' in that scene.\" In the end, Roeg only cut nine frames from the sequence, and the film was awarded an R rating in the United States. In Britain, the British Board of Film Censors judged the uncut version to be \"tasteful and integral to the plot\", and a scene in which Donald Sutherland's character can be clearly seen performing oral sex on Christie's character was permitted; it was given an X rating\u2014an adults only certificate. The sex scene remained controversial for some years after the film's release. The BBC cut it altogether when Don't Look Now premiered on UK television, causing a flood of complaints from viewers. The intimacy of the scene led to rumours that Christie and Sutherland had unsimulated sex which have persisted for years, and that outtakes from the scene were doing the rounds in screening rooms. Michael Deeley, who oversaw the film's UK distribution, claimed on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs that Warren Beatty had flown to London and demanded that the sex scene\u2014featuring then girlfriend Julie Christie\u2014be cut from the film. The rumours were seemingly confirmed in 2011 by former Variety editor Peter Bart, who was a Paramount executive at the time. In his book,  Infamous Players: A Tale of Movies, the Mob, (and Sex), Bart says he was on set on the day the scene was filmed and could clearly see Sutherland's penis \"moving in and out of\" Christie. Bart also reiterated Warren Beatty's discontent, noting that Beatty had contacted him to complain about what he perceived to be Roeg's exploitation of Christie, and insisting that he be allowed to help edit the film. Sutherland subsequently issued a statement through his publicist stating that the claims were not true, and that Bart did not witness the scene being filmed. Peter Katz, the film's producer, corroborated Sutherland's account that the sex was entirely simulated."

The two films have thematic similarities, and both end with their protagonists being led to preordained fates by a 'child' they believe to be helping. The film was among the top British titles at the UK box-office in 1974, second only to Confessions of a Window Cleaner, and ranking in the top twenty of the year overall. Michael Deeley, who was managing director of British Lion Films at the time of the film's release, claimed that the film's US reception was hurt by Paramount Pictures rushing the film into cinemas too early, due to the unexpected failure of Jonathan Livingston Seagull; despite its mismanaged distribution, Peter Bart\u2014from his time at Paramount\u2014recalls it performing \"fairly well\" at the box office. The film had recouped most of its expenses before it was even released, with its $1.1 million budget offset by the fee Paramount paid for the US distribution rights. Don't Look Now was chosen by the British Film Institute in 2000 as one of eight classic films from those that had begun to deteriorate to undergo restoration. On completion of the restoration in 2001, the film was given another theatrical release."

        "title": "Don't Look Now_Critical response and awards",
        "content": "At the time of its initial release, Don't Look Now was generally well received by critics, although some criticised it for being \"arty and mechanical\". Jay Cocks for Time, wrote that \"Don't Look Now is such a rich, complex and subtle experience that it demands more than one viewing\", while Variety commented that the film's visual flourishes made it \"much more than merely a well-made psycho-horror thriller\". Pauline Kael writing for The New Yorker was more reserved in her praise, considering the film to be \"the fanciest, most carefully assembled enigma yet put on the screen\" but that there was a \"distasteful clamminess about the picture\", while Gordon Gow of Films and Filming felt that it fell short of the aspirations of Nicolas Roeg's previous two films, Performance and Walkabout, but it was nevertheless a thriller of some depth. Vincent Canby, reviewer for The New York Times, on the other hand, criticised the film for a lack of suspense which he put down to a twist that comes halfway through rather than at the end, and at which point it \"stops being suspenseful and becomes an elegant travelogue that treats us to second-sightseeing in Venice\". Canby also suggested that second sight was not convincing on screen, since it appeared simply like flash-forward which is a standard story-telling device in films, and concluded that \"Not only do you probably have better things to do, but so, I'm sure, do most of the people connected with the film.\" British critics were especially enthusiastic about Nicolas Roeg's direction. In the view of Tom Milne of Monthly Film Bulletin, Roeg's combined work on Performance, Walkabout and Don't Look Now put him \"right up at the top as film-maker\". George Melly similarly wrote in The Observer that Roeg had joined \"that handful of names whose appearance at the end of the credit titles automatically creates a sense of anticipation\". Penelope Houston for Sight & Sound also found much to appreciate in Roeg's direction: \"Roeg deploys subtle powers of direction and Hitchcockian misdirection.\" American critics were similarly impressed with Roeg's work on the film. Jay Cocks regarded Don't Look Now to be Roeg's best work by far and that Roeg was one of \"those rare talents that can effect a new way of seeing\". Cocks also felt that the film was a marked improvement on the novella, noting that a reading \"makes one appreciate Roeg and Screenwriters [Allan] Scott and [Chris] Bryant all the more. Film and story share certain basic elements of plot and an ending of cruel surprise. The story is detached, almost cursory. Roeg and his collaborators have constructed an intricate, intense speculation about levels of perception and reality.\" Roger Ebert in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times commented that Roeg is \"a genius at filling his frame with threatening forms and compositions\", while Pauline Kael labelled him \"chillingly chic\" in hers. Even Vincent Canby, whose opinion of the film was negative overall, praised Roeg for being able to \"maintain a sense of menace long after the screenplay has any right to expect it\". Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland also received praise for their performances. Variety considered Sutherland to be at his most subdued but also at his most effective, while Christie does her \"best work in ages\". Cocks felt that thanks to their superb performances the film had a \"rigorous psychological truth and an emotional timbre\" that most other films in the supernatural genre lacked. Canby considered the \"sincerity of the actors\" to be one of the better aspects of the film, while Kael found Christie especially suited to the part, observing she has the \"anxious face of a modern tragic muse\". Roeg's use of Venice was praised too, with Roger Ebert finding that he \"uses Venice as well as she's ever been used in a movie\", and Canby also noted Venice is used to great effect: \"He gets a great performance from Venice, which is all wintery grays, blues and blacks, the color of the pigeons that are always underfoot.\" Variety also found much to admire about the editing, writing that it is \"careful and painstaking (the classically brilliant and erotic love-making scene is merely one of several examples) and plays a vital role in setting the film's mood\". Daphne du Maurier was pleased with the adaptation of her story, and wrote to Nicolas Roeg to congratulate him for capturing the essence of John and Laura's relationship. The film was not received well by Venetians, particularly the councillors who were afraid it would scare away tourists. At the 27th British Academy Film Awards, Anthony B. Richmond won for Best Cinematography, and Don't Look Now received further nominations in the Best Film, Direction, Actor, Actress, Sound Track and Film Editing categories. It was also nominated in the Best Motion Picture category at the 1974 Edgar Allan Poe Awards."

        "content": "The reputation of Don't Look Now has grown since its release and it is now regarded as a key work in horror cinema. It has led to some critics re-evaluating their original opinions of it:  Roger Ebert, nearly thirty years after his original review, stated that he had come to an \"accommodation\" with his reservations about what he termed the \"admitted weakness of the denouement\". Having gone through the film shot by shot, he came to the conclusion it is a \"masterpiece of physical filmmaking, in the way the photography evokes mood and the editing underlines it with uncertainty\". It was ranked 127th by Sight & Sound in the 2012 edition of their decennial critics poll. Don't Look Now is also very well regarded by other industry professionals, placing in the top 100 on Sight & Sound's directors poll, run in tandem with their critics poll. A survey of 1000 people who work across the film and television industry, undertaken by the British Film Institute in 1999, saw the film ranked eighth on their list of top 100 British films of the 20th century. It also topped a similar list organised by Time Out London in 2011, in which 150 film industry professionals were polled. In 2012 Time Out also undertook a poll of the horror industry, in which more than 100 professionals who work within or have connections to the genre selected their favourite horror films, which saw Don't Look Now finish in twelfth position."

        "content": "Don't Look Now has been much admired by and an influence on subsequent filmmakers.  Danny Boyle cites Nicolas Roeg as a key influence on his work and counts it amongst his favourite films, considering it to be \"one of the masterpieces of the last century\". Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith, and Jeremy Dyson drew upon Don't Look Now considerably for their television series The League of Gentlemen; Pemberton ranks it among the top three British horror films of the 1960s and 1970s, and says that he wants things he has written to make audiences feel the way he felt when he watched The Wicker Man and Don't Look Now. Similarly, Ryan Murphy considers his TV series American Horror Story to be a throwback to '60s and '70s psychological horror, citing Don't Look Now, Rosemary's Baby and The Shining as particular examples. Thematic and narrative similarities with Lars von Trier's Antichrist have also been observed, with Antichrist's cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, commenting that he has watched Don't Look Now more times than any other film. Fabrice Du Welz, whose film Vinyan has often been compared to Don't Look Now, has stated that it is a film he is \"obsessed with\", and one of his favourites, while Lynne Ramsay cited it as an influence on We Need to Talk about Kevin, which incidentally is also produced by Roeg's son, Luc. Ami Canaan Mann has also acknowledged she was influenced by atmospheric thrillers such as Picnic at Hanging Rock and Don't Look Now while directing her debut feature, Texas Killing Fields, and Ari Aster acknowledged that it was a key influence on Hereditary. Its imagery has been directly referenced in several works. The 2006 James Bond film, Casino Royale contains a small homage where James Bond pursues a female character through Venice, catching glimpses of her through the crowds wearing a red dress. The Belgium set thriller, In Bruges, starring Colin Farrell, includes a number of explicit references; director Martin McDonagh said that the \"Venice of Don't Look Now\" was the template for the depiction of Bruges in his film, and the film includes numerous thematic similarities, including one character stating that the film she is working on is a \"pastiche of Don't Look Now\". Flatliners, a 1990 supernatural thriller directed by Joel Schumacher, also draws explicitly on the red-coated childlike figure by having a character terrorised by a child wearing a red coat; coincidentally, the character who is being tormented is played by Kiefer Sutherland, Donald Sutherland's son.  In the 2007 stage play of Don't Look Now, written by Nell Leyshon and directed by Lucy Bailey, the play made a conscious effort to bypass the film and be a faithful adaptation of du Maurier's short story, but it did however retain the iconic red mac from the film as worn by the elusive childlike figure. Its influence is less obvious but still apparent in Out of Sight, a 1998 film directed by Steven Soderbergh. The famous intercutting technique used in the sex scene was used to similar effect in a sex scene featuring George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez.  The film's imagery and stylistic techniques have served as an inspiration to films such as Schindler's List directed by Steven Spielberg, Memento by Christopher Nolan, The Dark by John Fawcett, Frozen by Juliet McKoen, Submarine by Richard Ayoade, and Snow White and the Huntsman by Rupert Sanders. David Cronenberg regards it as the most frightening film he has seen, and its influence has been detected on Cronenberg's The Brood. Roeg frequently drew upon the world of pop music for his work, casting Mick Jagger in Performance, David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth and Art Garfunkel in Bad Timing, and in turn his films have served as inspiration for musicians. Big Audio Dynamite wrote a tribute song to Roeg, called \"E=MC2\", which included lyrical references to Don't Look Now\u2014among Roeg's other films\u2014along with clips from it in the video, directed by Luc Roeg, while Sophie Ellis-Bextor performed a \"pop synth homage\" to Don't Look Now with her song, \"Catch You\", and portions of the film were sampled in the M83 song \"America\"."

        "content": "Bhagat Singh is born on 28 September 1907, at Banga village of Lyallpur District in Punjab Province of British India. At the age of 12, Singh takes a solemn vow to free India from the British Raj after witnessing the aftermath of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. Soon after the massacre, he learns of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's satyagraha policies and begins to support the non-cooperation movement, in which thousands of people burn British-made clothing and abandon school, college studies, and government jobs. In February 1922, Gandhi calls off the movement after the Chauri Chaura incident. Feeling betrayed by Gandhi, Singh decides to become a revolutionary, and, as an adult, joins the Hindustan Republic Association in its struggle for India's independence, ending up in prison for his activities. Singh's father, Kishen, bails him out so that he can get him to run a dairy farm and marry a girl named Mannewali. Singh runs away from home, leaving a note saying that his love for the country comes first. When Lala Lajpat Rai is beaten to death by the police while protesting against the Simon Commission, Singh, along with Shivram Hari Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar and Chandra Shekhar Azad, assassinate John P. Saunders, a police officer, on 17 December 1928. Later on in the year 1929, when the British propose the Trade Disputes and Public Safety Bills, Singh, along with Batukeshwar Dutt, initiate a bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly. He and Dutt throw the bombs on empty benches due to their intention to avoid causing casualties. They are subsequently arrested and tried publicly. Singh then gives a speech about his ideas of revolution, stating that he wanted to tell the world about the freedom fighters himself rather than let the British misrepresent them as violent people, citing this as the reason for bombing the assembly. Singh soon becomes more popular than Gandhi among the Indian populace, in particular the younger generation, laborers and farmers. In Lahore Central Jail, Singh and all of the other fellow prisoners, including Sukhdev and Rajguru, undertake a 116-day hunger strike to improve the conditions of Indian political prisoners. On the 63rd day, one of Singh's partners Jatin Das, dies in the police custody as he could not bear the hunger anymore. Meanwhile, Azad, whom the British had repeatedly failed to capture, is ambushed at the Alfred Park in Allahabad on 27 February 1931. The police surround the entire park leading to a shootout; refusing to be captured by the British, Azad commits suicide with the last remaining bullet in his Colt pistol. Fearing the growing popularity of the hunger strike amongst the Indian public nationwide, Lord Irwin orders the re-opening of the Saunders' murder case, which leads to death sentences being imposed on Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru. The Indians hope that Gandhi will use his pact with Irwin as an opportunity to save Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru's lives. Irwin refuses Gandhi's request for their release. Gandhi reluctantly agrees to sign a pact which includes the clause: \"Release of political prisoners except for the ones involved in violence\". Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru are hanged in secrecy on 23 March 1931."

        "content": "In 1998, the film director Rajkumar Santoshi read several books on the socialist revolutionary, Bhagat Singh, and felt that a biopic would help revive interest in him. Although Manoj Kumar made a film about Bhagat in 1965, titled Shaheed, Santoshi felt that despite being \"a great source of inspiration on the lyrics and music front\", it did not \"dwell on Bhagat Singh's ideology and vision\". In August 2000, the screenwriter Anjum Rajabali mentioned to Santoshi about his work on Har Dayal, whose revolutionary activities inspired Udham Singh. Santoshi then persuaded Rajabali to draft a script based on Bhagat's life as he was inspired by Udham Singh. Santoshi gave Rajabali a copy of Shaheed Bhagat Singh, K. K. Khullar's biography of the revolutionary. Rajabali said that reading the book \"created an intense curiosity in me about the mind of this man. I definitely wanted to know more about him.\" His interest in Bhagat intensified after he read The Martyr: Bhagat Singh's Experiments in Revolution (2000) by journalist Kuldip Nayar. The following month, Rajabali formally began his research on Bhagat while admitting to Santoshi that it was \"a difficult task\". Gurpal Singh, a Film and Television Institute of India graduate, and internet blogger Sagar Pandya assisted him. Santoshi received input from Kultar Singh, Bhagat's younger brother, who told the director he would have his full co-operation if the film accurately depicted Bhagat's ideologies. Rajabali wanted to \"recreate the world that Bhagat Singh lived in\", and his research required him to \"not only understand the man, but also the influences on him, the politics of that era\". In an interview with Sharmila Taliculam of Rediff.com in the year 2000, Rajabali said that the film would \"deal with Bhagat Singh, the man, rather than the freedom fighter\". Many aspects of Bhagat's life, including his relationship with fianc\u00e9e Mannewali, were derived from Piyush Mishra's 1994 play Gagan Damama Bajyo; Mishra was subsequently credited with writing the film's dialogues. A. G. Noorani's 1996 book, The Trial of Bhagat Singh: Politics of Justice, provided the basis for the trial sequences. Gurpal obtained additional information from 750 newspaper clippings of The Tribune dated from September 1928 to March 1931, and from Bhagat's prison notebooks. These gave Rajabali \"an idea of what had appealed to the man, the literary and intellectual influences that impacted him in that period\". By the end of the year 2000, Santoshi and Rajabali completed work on the script and showed it to Kumar and Ramesh Taurani of Tips Industries; both were impressed by it. The Taurani brothers agreed to produce the film under their banner and commence filming after Santoshi had finished his work on Lajja (2001)."

        "content": "Sunny Deol was initially cast as Bhagat, but he left the project owing to schedule conflicts and differences with Santoshi over his remuneration. Santoshi then preferred to cast new faces instead of established actors but was not pleased with the performers who auditioned. Ajay Devgn (then known as Ajay Devgan) was finally chosen for the lead character because Santoshi felt he had \"the eyes of a revolutionary. His introvert nature conveys loud and clear signals that there is a volcano inside him ready to burst.\" After Devgn performed a screen test dressed as Bhagat, Santoshi was \"pleasantly surprised\" to see Devgn's face closely resemble Singh's and cast him in the part. The Legend of Bhagat Singh marked Devgn's second collaboration with Santoshi after Lajja. Devgn called the film \"the most challenging assignment\" in his career. He had not watched Shaheed before signing up for the project. To prepare for the role, Devgn studied all the references Santoshi and Rajabali had procured to develop the film's script. He also lost weight to more closely resemble Bhagat. Santoshi chose Akhilendra Mishra to play Azad as he also resembled his character. In addition to reading Shiv Verma's Sansmritiyan, Mishra read Bhagwan Das Mahore's and Sadashiv Rao Malkapurkar's accounts of the revolutionary. Because of his astrological beliefs, he even obtained Azad's horoscope to determine his personality. In an interview with Rediff.com's Lata Khubchandani, Mishra mentioned that while informing his father about his role of Azad, he revealed to him that they originally hailed from Kanpur, the same place where Azad's ancestors were from. This piece of information encouraged Mishra to play Azad. Sushant Singh and D. Santosh (in his cinematic debut) were cast as Bhagat's friends and fellow members of the Hindustan Republican Association, Sukhdev Thapar and Shivaram Rajguru. Santoshi believed their faces resembled those of the two revolutionaries. To learn about their characters, Sushant, like Mishra, read Sansmritiyan while Santosh visited Rajguru's family members. The actors were also chosen according to their characters' backgrounds. This was true in the case of Santosh and also Amitabh Bhattacharjee, who played Jatin Das, the man who devised the bomb for Bhagat and Batukeshwar Dutt. Santosh and Bhattacharjee were from Maharashtra and West Bengal like Rajguru and Das. Raj Babbar and Farida Jalal were cast as Bhagat's parents, Kishen Singh and Vidyawati Kaur, while Amrita Rao played Mannewali, Bhagat's fianc\u00e9e."

        "content": "Principal photography began in January 2002 and was completed in May. The first schedule of filming took place in Agra and Manali following which the unit moved to the Film City studio in Mumbai. According to the film's cinematographer, K. V. Anand, around 85 sets were constructed at Film City by Nitin Chandrakant Desai who was in charge of the production design, and \"99 percent of the background\" featured in the film was sets. Desai used sepia tint throughout the film to create a period feel. Additional scenes depicting the massacre of 1919 were filmed at  a set constructed to look like the Bagh as it was 83 years ago; some of them were shot between 9\u00a0pm and 6\u00a0am. The scenes at the Bagh set and other surrounding locations of Amritsar at the beginning of the film feature Nakshdeep Singh as the younger Bhagat. Santoshi selected Nakshdeep after receiving photographs of the boy from his father, Komal Singh, who played Mannewali's father. Kultar stayed with the production unit for seven days during the outdoor location shooting in Pune. Both Santoshi and Devgn appreciated the interactions they had with Kultar, noting that he provided \"deep insights into his brother's life\". Kultar was pleased with the sincerity of the cast and crew and shared private letters written by Bhagat with them. The song \"Pagdi Sambhal Jatta\" was the last part to be filmed. A sequence in the song featuring Devgn appearing between two factions of backup Bhangra dancers took three takes to be completed. The Legend of Bhagat Singh was made on a budget of 200\u00a0\u2013 250\u00a0million (about US$4.15\u00a0\u2013 5.18\u00a0million in 2002)."

        "content": "A. R. Rahman composed the soundtrack and score for The Legend of Bhagat Singh, marking his first collaboration with Santoshi. Sameer wrote the lyrics for the songs. In an interview with Arthur J. Pais of Rediff.com, Rahman said that Santoshi wanted him to compose songs that would stand apart from his other projects like Lagaan (2001) and Zubeidaa (2001). Rahman took care to compose the tunes for \"Mera Rang De Basanti\" in a slow-paced manner to avoid comparisons with the songs in Shaheed, which he and Santoshi found to be fast-paced. Rahman followed the same procedure for \"Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna\". He created a softer tune, saying that the \"song is pictured on men who have fasted for over a month. How can I compose a high-sounding tune for that song?\" Despite this, Rahman admitted that \"Des Mere Des\" had \"some strains\" from Lagaans music. Rahman took \"Santoshi's commitment to the film\" as a source of inspiration to make an album that was \" and different.\" Rahman experimented with Punjabi music more than he had done before on his previous soundtracks, receiving assistance from Sukhwinder Singh and Sonu Nigam. The soundtrack was completed within two months, with \"Des Mere Des\" recorded in an hour. The soundtrack, marketed by Tips, was released on 8 May 2002 in New Delhi. The songs, especially \"Mera Rang De Basanti\" and \"Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna\", received favourable reviews. A review carried by The Hindu said that while \"Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna\" had a \"forceful\" impact, \"Mera Rang De Basanti\" and \"Pagdi Sambhal Jatta\" were \"not the boom-boom types but subtly tuned\". The review praised Rahman's ability \"to impart the sombre and poignant mood\" in all the album's songs \"so well that despite being subdued, it retains the patriotic fervour\". Seema Pant of Rediff.com said that \"Mera Rang De Basanti\" and \"Mahive Mahive\" were \"well rendered\" by their respective singers and called \"Sura So Pahchaniye\" an \"intense track, both lyrically as well as composition wise\". Pant praised Sukhwinder Singh's \"exquisite rendition\" of \"Pagdi Sambhal Jatta\" and described the duet version of \"Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna\" as having \"been beautifully composed\". She appreciated how the \"tabla, santoor and flute gives this slow and soft number a classical touch.\" A critic from Sify said the music is \"good\". While Pant and the Sify reviewer concurred with Rahman that \"Des Mere Des\" was similar to Lagaans music, the review in The Hindu compared the song to \"Bharat Hum Ko Jaan Se Pyaara Hain\" (\"Thamizha Thamizha\") from Roja (1992)."

A week before the film's release, Article 51 A Forum, a non-governmental organisation in Delhi, believed The Legend of Bhagat Singh to be historically inaccurate, criticising the inclusion of Mannewali as Bhagat's widow, and stating the films were made \"without any research or devotion\" and the filmmakers were just looking at the box-office prospects to \"make spicy films based on imaginary episodes\". Kumar Taurani defended his film saying that he did not add Rao \"for ornamental value\", noting he would have opted for an established actress instead if that were the case. A press statement issued by Tips Industries said: \"This girl from Manawali village loved Bhagat Singh so totally that she remained unmarried till death and was known as Bhagat Singh's widow.\" The chief operating officer of Tips Industries, Raju Hingorani, pointed out that Kultar had authenticated the film, stating: \"With his backing, why must we be afraid of other allegations?\" On 29 May 2002, a 14-page petition was filed by Paramjit Kaur, the daughter of Bhagat's youngest brother, Rajinder Singh, at the Punjab and Haryana High Court to stay the release of both The Legend of Bhagat Singh and 23rd March 1931: Shaheed, alleging that they \"contained distorted versions\" of the freedom fighter's life. Kaur's lawyer, Sandeep Bhansal, argued that Bhagat singing a duet with Mannewali and wearing garlands were \"untrue and amounted to distortion of historical facts\". Two days later, the petition came up for hearing before the Judges Justice J. L. Gupta and Justice Narinder Kumar Sud; both refused to stay the films' release, observing that the petition was moved \"too late and it would not be proper to stop the screening of the films\"."

        "content": "The Legend of Bhagat Singh received generally positive critical feedback, with praise for its direction, story, screenplay, cinematography, production design and the performances of Devgn and Sushant. Chitra Mahesh praised Santoshi's direction, noting in her review for The Hindu that he \"shows some restraint in handling the narrative\". She appreciated the film's technical aspects and Devgn's rendition, calling his interpretation of Bhagat \"powerful, without being strident\". Writing for The Times of India, Dominic Ferrao commended Devgn, Sushant, Babbar and Mishra, saying that they all come \"off with flying colours\". A review carried by Sify labelled the film \"slick and commendable\"; it also termed Devgn's portrayal of Bhagat as \"fabulous\" but felt he \"overrides\" the character and that \"the supporting characters make more impact than him.\" In a comparative analysis of The Legend of Bhagat Singh with 23rd March 1931: Shaheed, Ziya-Us-Salam of The Hindu found the former to be a better film because of the \"clearly etched out\" supporting characters, while opining Devgn was more \"restrained and credible\" than Bobby Deol. Salam admired Sushant's performance, opining that he has \"a fine screen presence, good timing and an ability to hold his own in front of more celebrated actors\". In a more mixed comparison, Rediff.com's Amberish K. Diwanji, despite finding The Legend of Bhagat Singh and Devgn to be the better film and actor like Salam, criticised the \"constant shouting and mouthing of dialogues\". He responded negatively to the inclusion of Bhagat's fianc\u00e9e, pointing out the film took liberties in using this \"slim\" piece of information \"just to have a girl sing.\" Diwanji, however, commended the narrative structure of The Legend of Bhagat Singh, saying that the film captured the revolutionary's life and journey well, thereby making it \"worth watching and give[ing] it relevant historical background.\" Among overseas reviewers, Dave Kehr of The New York Times complimented the placement of the film's song sequences, especially that of \"Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna\" and \"Mere Rang De Basanti\". Kehr called Devgn's interpretation of Bhagat \"glowering\" while praising Sushant's \"urbane and unpredictable\" rendition of Sukhdev. Although Varietys Derek Elley found The Legend of Bhagat Singh to be \"drawn with more warmth\" and approved of Devgn's and Sushant's performances, he was not pleased with the \"choppy\" screenplay in the film's first half. He concluded his review by saying that the film \"has a stronger lead [thespian] and richer gallery of characters that triumph over often unsubtle direction\". Some of the criticism was also directed towards the treatment of Gandhi. Mahesh notes that he \"appears in rather poor light\" and was depicted as making \"little effort\" to secure a pardon for Bhagat, Sukhdev and Rajguru. Diwanji concurs with Mahesh while also saying that the Gandhi\u2013Irwin Pact as seen in the film would make the audience think that Gandhi \"condemned the trio to be hanged by inking the agreement\" while pointing out the agreement itself \"had a different history and context.\" Kehr believed the film's depiction of Gandhi was its \"most interesting aspect\". He described Surendra Rajan's version of Gandhi as \"a faintly ridiculous poseur, whose policies play directly into the hands of the British\" and in that aspect, he was very different from \"the serene sage\" portrayed by Ben Kingsley in Richard Attenborough's Gandhi (1982). Like Diwanji, Elley also notes how the film denounces Gandhi by blaming him \"for not trying very hard\" to prevent Bhagat's execution."

It was twice used in the following century by Greek writer Lucian: in \"Remarks addressed to an illiterate book-fancier\" and in his play \"Timon the Misanthrope\". One other contemporary poetic source is a paederastic epigram by Straton of Sardis in the Greek Anthology. At roughly the same time, an alternative version of the fable was alluded to in Saying 102 of the apocryphal Gospel of Thomas. This example involves oxen rather than a horse: \"Jesus said, 'Woe to the Pharisees, for they are like a dog sleeping in the manger of oxen, for neither does he eat nor does he let the oxen eat'.\" Assuming that this gospel is not an original document, the saying seems to be an adaptation of criticism of the Pharisees in the canonical Gospel of Matthew (23.13): \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in men's faces; you do not enter yourselves, nor will you let others enter.\""

        "content": "Thereof to take up any food. Though the next reference in English is in John Langland's The Pilgrimage of the Life of Man (1426), where it is applied to a personification of miserliness, the work was written almost a century before in French by Guillaume de Deguileville (1335). While a horse figures in some allusions by later writers, the ox is the preferred beast in Renaissance emblem books. It appears as such in a Latin poem by Hieronymus Osius (1564), although the accompanying illustration shows both an ox and an ass and the dog there, as in Steinh\u00f6wel, carries a bone clenched between its teeth. Oxen appear also in the Latin prose version of Arnold Freitag (1579) and in the English poem by Geoffrey Whitney (1586). Most of these authors follow Steinh\u00f6wel in interpreting the fable as an example of envy, but Christoph Murer's emblem of 1622 is titled meanness (Kargheit) and the accompanying verse explains that such behaviour is miserly, not using what one has for oneself nor for the relief of others in need. Later on the dog's behaviour is reinterpreted as malicious, a reading made clear in Roger L'Estrange's pithy version: \"A churlish envious Cur was gotten into a manger, and there lay growling and snarling to keep the Provender. The Dog eat none himself, and yet rather ventur'd the starving his own Carcase than he would suffer any Thing to be the better for't. THE MORAL. Envy pretends to no other Happiness than what it derives from the Misery of other People, and will rather eat nothing itself than not to starve those that would.\" Samuel Croxall echoes L'Estrange's observation in Fables of Aesop and Others (1722). \"The stronger the passion is, the greater torment he endures; and subjects himself to a continual real pain, by only wishing ill to others.\"  It is with this understanding that the idiom of \"a dog in a manger\" is most often used currently. However, a recent study has noted that it seems to be falling out of use, in America at least, concluding that \"the majority of [respondents] do not know it or even recall ever having heard it\"."

        "content": "One of Lucian's allusions to the fable gives it a metaphorically sexual slant: \"You used to say that they acted absurdly in that they loved you to excess, yet did not dare to enjoy you when they might, and instead of giving free rein to their passion when it lay in their power to do so, they kept watch and ward, looking fixedly at the seal and the bolt; for they thought it enjoyment enough, not that they were able to enjoy you themselves, but that they were shutting out everyone else from a share in the enjoyment, like the dog in the manger that neither ate the barley herself nor permitted the hungry horse to eat it.\" (Timon the Misanthrope) In the 1687 Francis Barlow edition of the fables, Aphra Behn similarly sums up the sexual politics of the idiom: \"Thus aged lovers with young beautys live, Keepe off the joys they want the power to give.\" It was of exactly such a situation involving a eunuch and his slaveboys that Straton had complained in the Greek anthology. But the idiom was also applied to occasions of heterosexual jealousy between equals, as for example in Emily Bront\u00eb's Wuthering Heights, where it arises during an argument between Catherine Linton and Isabella Linton over Isabella's love for Heathcliff. A Spanish story involving sexual jealousy and selfishness appears in Lope de Vega's play El Perro del Hortelano (The Gardener's Dog, in 1618). In this case, De Vega's title alludes to the parallel European idiom involving a variant story in which a gardener sets his dog to guard his cabbages (or lettuces). After the gardener's death the dog continues to forbid people access to the beds, giving rise to the simile \"He's like the gardener's dog that eats no cabbage and won't let others either\" or, for short, \"playing the gardener's dog\" (faire le chien du jardinier). In the  Martinique Creole there is also the similar-sounding proverb, \"The dog doesn\u2019t like the banana and he doesn\u2019t want the hen to eat it.\""

        "title": "The Dog in the Manger_Artistic use",
        "content": "Popular artistic allusions to the fable, or the idiom arising from it, were especially common during the 19th century. Where Lope de Vega had adapted the theme to a problem play in the 17th century, the Belgian composer Albert Grisar used it as the basis for his one-act comic opera of 1855, Le chien du jardinier. The idiom was also taken up in the US by the successful writer of farces, Charles H. Hoyt, where a horse rather than the more common ox figured on the 1899 poster (see left). The title has also been used in various media since then, but without reference to the fable in publicity or on covers. Several well-known artists had illustrated fable collections and their designs were recycled for various purposes. Among these may be mentioned Wenceslaus Hollar's print for the 1666 Ogilby edition of Aesop's fables, in which a dog occupies the manger and barks at a single ox being driven into a wooden barn. Shortly afterwards, Francis Barlow pictured the dog snarling on a pile of hay in a brick-built barn,  while the dog does so in a more open farmyard structure in Samuel Howitt's A New Work of Animals (1810). Hollar's design of the ox turning its head to look round at the dog with the barn's brick entrance behind was clearly an influence on later illustrators, including those for the various editions of Samuel Croxall's fable collection and for Thomas Bewick's of 1818. Such illustrations were influential too on those who created designs for crockery. That on a Spode serving dish from 1831 is also related to the Barlow design, although the action takes place outside the barn. A Staffordshire nursery dish of 1835, however, has more in common with Howitt's design. The fable also figured on the popular alphabet plates from Brownhills Pottery later in the 19th century, although in this case only the ox's head is featured as it gazes at the dog reared up and barking. In Britain artistic preference was for the anecdotal and the sentimental among 19th century genre artists, who found the fable ideal for their purposes. The most successful, and typical of many others, was Walter Hunt (1861\u20131941), whose \"Dog in the Manger\" (1885) was bought by the Chantrey Bequest and is now in Tate Britain. At least two versions exist of the work. In one two calves peer at a Jack Russell puppy that sits looking back in the hay that they want to eat. In the Tate version, a different breed is curled up asleep in their manger. The idiom was also put to figurative use during the 19th century. In much the same anecdotal tradition, the print-maker Thomas Lord Busby (1782\u20131838) used the title to show a dyspeptic man eyeing askance a huge dinner, while hungry beggars and an importunate dog look on, in a work from 1826. Later on Charles H. Bennett revisited the scene in his The Fables of Aesop and Others Translated into Human Nature (1857), where a dog dressed as a footman and carrying food to his master bares his teeth at the poor ox begging at the door. In this case the fable was rewritten to fit the scenario. Such work, bordering on the cartoon, provided a profitable avenue for social commentary. An American example appeared in the illustration to a children's book of 1880, where a dog dressed as a ruffian stands on the straw, cudgel in hand, warning off a cow and her calf (see above). It ushers in use of the theme in illustrated papers a little later. J. S. Pughe's centrefold in Puck pictures a dog in the uniform of a U.S. Marine holding off European nations that wish to participate in the Nicaragua Canal scheme. It was followed by the cover cartoon of Harper's Weekly picturing William Jennings Bryan as the dog, obstructing the choice of the Democratic presidential candidacy and preventing others getting at the White House oats."

She encounters Stoney and his hippie band Mumblin' Jim in a coffee shop. The boys are sympathetic, especially when they discover that she is deaf and uses lip reading. They hide her from the police and help her look for her brother. She has a postcard from her brother that reads \"Jess Saes: God is alive and well and living in a sugar cube\". Sugar cubes were often used as a method of creating individual doses of LSD. The band is approached by a promoter who arranges for them to perform at a place called the Ballroom. Artist Warren, who designs the psychedelic posters advertising the band, freaks out badly in his gallery, apparently on STP. He sees everyone, including himself, as walking dead, and his own hand as festering, and he tries to cut it off with a circular saw. While helping him, Jenny notices a large sculpture resembling abstract flames in a corner and recognizes it as her brother's work. The gallery owner says the artist is known as \"The Seeker\", an itinerant preacher. Ex-band member Dave may know The Seeker's current whereabouts. Dave left the band because he felt that they were too concerned with worldly success, rather than the music itself. His information leads the gang to a junkyard. Nearby is a sign reading \"Jess Saes\" -- \"Jesus Saves\", with some letters missing. The \"sugar cube\" slogan is painted on the side of a car that Jenny recognizes as her brother's. However, a group of thugs who frequent the junkyard accost the group. They dislike The Seeker's street preaching and his themes of love and peace. They threaten to rape Jenny. Violence ensues, and the group barely escape with their lives. Jenny's friendship with Stoney has become sexual. She does not know his reputation for one-night stands and lack of commitment. She attends a mock funeral staged by a large group of hippies, with background music by the Seeds; the theme of their play is that death is not the end, and that love and a refusal to hurt others are what keep us alive. In Stoney's crowded home, everyday hippie life is less than ideal. The residents are all involved in contemplation, sex, sleeping, dancing or decorating, but little cleaning or maintenance. Jenny tries to wash the mountain of dishes in the kitchen and finds that the plumbing is broken, but everybody just continues dancing. Frustrated, she interrupts Stoney's band practice to inform him that she is going to take a walk. Stoney later goes to find her and ends up at the art gallery, where he hears breaking glass and slips inside. The Seeker has returned to the art gallery to pick up his sculpture. Challenged by Stoney, he pleads that the work should not be touched; it is actually not art, but a shrine that he created on God's request. He is glad that Jenny is looking for him, but says he is on drugs and wants to be sober when they meet. Jenny's deafness is hysterical; their mother was cruelly abusive and burned Jenny's beloved toys. Jenny was violently traumatized and apparently had a stroke; she was deaf from that moment. The performance at the Ballroom is a success; Mumblin' Jim play, along with the Strawberry Alarm Clock. The Seeker shows up, hoping to see Jenny, but the junkyard thugs are also present and chase him back to his home. At an after-show party, Dave remonstrates Stoney over his ambition for commercial success, as well as his cavalier treatment of Jenny. Dave consoles Jenny and puts STP in some fruit juice. He offers himself to her, but Stoney charges in and angrily shouts at Jenny, calling her a \"bitch\". Heartbroken, Jenny accepts Dave's glass of fruit juice and drinks nearly all of it. Jenny again explains her search for Steve, and Dave pulls a note from his pocket that reads \"God is in the flame\" and contains an address. Jenny runs out and takes a streetcar. Stoney rouses Dave, now tripping on STP, to help find her. Pursued by the junkyard thugs back to his home, Steve lights a fire inside his shrine. Soon the entire house is ablaze. Jenny arrives to find a crowd gathering near the house; she runs in just in time to see him standing in the middle of the flames, absorbed in prayer; he sees her, but merely smiles and waves. In her grief and confusion, she runs up to the roof, hallucinating wildly. She apparently jumps into a reservoir. She then sees fire bombs heading towards her, barely missing her. She is standing at the middle of the Golden Gate Bridge, cars coming at her from both directions with horns blaring. She holds her hands over her ears, and Dave and Stoney find her. Dave shoves her out of the way of an oncoming car and is struck and killed. As he dies, he murmurs that he hopes this, too, will be a good trip. Sickened and angry, Jenny tries to leave, but Stoney embraces her. The film ends with the two holding each other and crying, while an image of the mock funeral reappears."

The majority of the songs in the film and on the original soundtrack album were performed by the Storybook, a San Fernando Valley garage band. The version of \"The Pretty Song from Psych-Out\" that appears on the film's soundtrack album was recorded by the Storybook, but the version heard in the film was by Strawberry Alarm Clock."

        "content": "March of the Penguins (French La Marche de l'empereur ; ) is a 2005 French feature-length nature documentary directed and co-written by Luc Jacquet, and co-produced by Bonne Pioche and the National Geographic Society. The documentary depicts the yearly journey of the emperor penguins of Antarctica. In autumn, all the penguins of breeding age (five years old and over) leave the ocean, which is their normal habitat, to walk inland to their ancestral breeding grounds. There, the penguins participate in a courtship that, if successful, results in the hatching of a chick. For the chick to survive, both parents must make multiple arduous journeys between the ocean and the breeding grounds over the ensuing months. It took one year for the two isolated cinematographers Laurent Chalet and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Maison to shoot the documentary, which was shot around the French scientific base of Dumont d'Urville in Ad\u00e9lie Land. March of the Penguins was released in France on 26 January 2005 by Buena Vista International and in the United States by Warner Independent Pictures on 24 June 2005. The documentary won the 2006 Oscar for Best Documentary Feature. On 1 June 2010, a home video release in France included the movie in the Disneynature collection. The documentary had a 2007 follow-up movie, Arctic Tale, which only took in at the box office $1.8 million worldwide. A direct sequel titled March of the Penguins 2: The Next Step (aka March of the Penguins 2: The Call) was released in France in 2017 by Disneynature. It was released in the United States exclusively on Hulu on 23 March 2018."

        "content": "The emperor penguins use a particular spot as their breeding ground because it is on ice that is solid year round with no danger of the ice becoming too soft to support the colony that exists. At the end of Antarctic summer, the breeding ground is only a few hundred meters away from the open water where the penguins can feed. However, by the end of winter, the breeding ground is over  away from the nearest open water. To reach it, all the penguins of breeding age must traverse this great distance. The penguins practice serial monogamy within each breeding season. The female lays a single egg, and the co-operation of the parents is needed if the chick is to survive. After the female lays the egg, she transfers it to the feet of the waiting male with minimal exposure to the elements, as the intense cold could kill the developing embryo. The male tends to the egg when the female returns to the sea, now even farther away, both to feed herself and to obtain extra food for feeding her chick when she returns. He has not eaten in two months and by the time she leaves the hatching area, he will have lost a third of his body weight. For an additional two months, the males huddle together for warmth, and incubate their eggs. They endure temperatures approaching , and their only source of water is snow that falls on the breeding ground. When the chicks hatch, the males have only a small meal to feed them, and if the female does not return, they must abandon their chick and return to the sea to feed themselves. By the time they return, they have lost half their weight and have not eaten for four months. The chicks are also at risk from predatory birds such as northern giant petrels. The mother penguins come back and feed their young, while the male penguins go all the way back to sea (70\u00a0miles) to feed themselves. This gives the mothers time to feed their young ones and bond with them. Unfortunately, a fierce storm arrives and some of the chicks perish. The death of a chick is tragic, but it does allow the parents to return to the sea to feed for the rest of the breeding season. When a mother penguin loses its young in a fierce storm, it sometimes attempts to steal another mother's chick. When the other parent returns, it can recognize the chick only from its unique call. Many parents die on the trip, killed by exhaustion or by predators (such as the leopard seal), dooming their chicks back at the breeding ground. The ingenious fight against starvation is a recurring theme throughout the documentary. In one scene, near-starving chicks are shown taking sustenance out of their father's throat sacs, 11th-hour nourishment in the form of a milky, protein-rich substance secreted from a sac in the father's throat to feed their chicks in the event that circumstances require. The parents must then tend to the chick for an additional four months, shuttling back and forth to the sea to provide food for their young. As spring progresses, the trip gets progressively easier as the ice melts and the distance to the sea decreases, until finally the parents can leave the chicks to fend for themselves."

        "content": "The DVD version includes a 54-minute film entitled Of Penguins and Men made by the film crew Laurent Chalet and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Mason about the filming of March of the Penguins. Director and film crew spent more than 13 months at the Dumont d'Urville Station, where the Institut polaire fran\u00e7ais Paul-\u00c9mile Victor is based. Although the penguins' meeting place, one of four in Antarctica, was known to be near, the day on which it occurs is not known, so they had to be ready every day. Fortunately, the gathering that year was huge \u2013 more than 1,200 penguins, compared with the norm of a few hundred. For cameras to operate at \u221240\u00b0, they had to use film and to load all the film for the day, as it was impossible to reload outside. Because of the isolation from any film studios, remembering each shot was necessary to ensure continuity and to make sure that all the necessary sequences were finished. The main challenge of making the documentary was the weather with temperatures between \u221250 and \u221260\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221258 and \u221276\u00a0\u00b0F). At dawn, the film crew would spend half an hour putting on six layers of clothes, and on some days they could not spend more than three hours outside. They worked in winds with gusts up to 125 miles per hour, \"which in some ways is worse than the cold temperatures\" according to director Jaquet."

        "title": "March of the Penguins_International versions",
        "content": "The style of the documentary differs considerably between the original French version and some of the international versions. The original French-language release features a romanticized first-person narrative as if the story is being told by the penguins themselves. The narration alternates between a female (Romane Bohringer) and a male (Charles Berling) narrator speaking the alternate roles of the female and male penguin, and as the chicks are born, their narration is handled by child actor Jules Sitruk. This style is mimicked in some of the international versions. For example, in the Hungarian version, actors \u00c1kos K\u0151szegi, Anna Kubik, and G\u00e1bor Morvai provide the voices of the penguins, and the German version as seen in German movie theaters (and in the televised broadcast in April 2007 on channel ProSieben) uses the voices of Andrea Loewig, Thorsten Michaelis, and Adrian Kilian for the \"dubbed dialog\" of the penguins. This style of narration is also used in the Danish and Cantonese DVD versions. The French release was handled by Buena Vista International France, a division of Walt Disney Studios. Disney also attempted to get US distribution rights to the film, but their bid ultimately failed; the English-language distribution rights were later acquired at the Sundance documentary festival in January 2005 by Adam Leipzig of National Geographic Films, who had forged a distribution partnership with Warner Bros. Pictures via their Warner Independent Pictures label. In contrast to the French version, their English release uses a more traditional third-person narrative by a single voice, actor Morgan Freeman. Similarly, the Austrian channel ORF 1 used for their broadcast in April 2007, the alternate version available on the German \"Special Edition\" DVD which uses a documentary narration voiceover spoken by the German actor Sky Du Mont. Other releases' narrators include the Dutch version, narrated by Belgian comedian Urbanus; the Indian version, narrated in Hindi and English by Indian actor Amitabh Bachchan, is titled Penguins: A Love Story; the Polish version, narrated by Polish actor Marek Kondrat; and the Swedish version, narrated by Swedish actor G\u00f6sta Ekman. The Filipino version is narrated by actress Sharon Cuneta and translated by Chris Martinez and Eugene Evasco; it is entitled Penguin, Penguin, Paano Ka Ginawa? (English: Penguin, Penguin, How Were You Made?) with the English title as the subtitle. The Filipino title is similar to that of a Philippine novel and film, Bata, Bata, Paano Ka Ginawa? (English: Child, Child, How Were You Made?) Another difference between the various international versions involves the music. The original version uses an original experimental soundtrack by electronic music composer \u00c9milie Simon, whereas the English-language version replaces it with an instrumental score by Alex Wurman. The Hindi version happens to use the music from the French version."

Subsequently, Warner Bros and National Geographic's English-language version was released in the rest of North America on 24 June 2005, drawing huge praise from most critics who found it both informative and charming. March of the Penguins has an approval rating of 94% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 184 reviews, and an average rating of 7.82/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"Only the most hardened soul won't be moved by this heartwarming doc\". Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". The documentary also proved popular with moviegoers, distinguishing itself as one of the most successful documentaries of the season on a per-theatre basis: it became the second most successful documentary released in North America, after Fahrenheit 9/11, grossing over $77 million in the United States and Canada (in nominal dollars, from 1982 to the present.) It grossed over $127 million worldwide. It is the only movie from Warner Independent to be rated G by the MPAA."

This Region 2 release featured no English audio tracks or subtitles. The English version was released on DVD in the United States by Warner Home Video on 29 November 2005. It was never released on VHS by Warner Home Video, due to A Very Long Engagement being the last VHS by Warner Independent. It however spawned a VHS in French locations, such as French Canadian regions. It was later released on Blu-Ray by Warner on 27 March 2007. Neither release contains the French language version of the movie. An extra on the DVD issue was the controversial 1948 Bugs Bunny cartoon Frigid Hare, in which Bugs visits the South Pole and meets a young penguin fleeing an Inuk hunter. The cartoon is not frequently seen because of its stereotypical depiction of the Inuk hunter, but it was included here uncut and uncensored.

        "content": "The documentary attracted some political and social commentary in which the penguins were viewed anthropomorphically as having similarities with, and even lessons for, human society. Michael Medved praised the documentary for promoting conservative family values by showing the value of stable parenthood. Medved's comments provoked responses by others, including Andrew Sullivan, who pointed out that the penguins are not in fact monogamous for more than one year, in reality practicing serial monogamy. Matt Walker of New Scientist pointed out that many emperor penguin \"adoptions\" of chicks are in fact kidnappings, as well as behaviours observed in other penguin species, such as ill treatment of weak chicks, prostitution, and ostracism of rare albino penguins. \"For instance, while it is true that emperor penguins often adopt each other's chicks, they do not always do so in a way the moralisers would approve of.\" Sullivan and Walker both conclude that trying to use animal behavior as an example for human behavior is a mistake. The director, Luc Jacquet, has condemned such comparisons between penguins and humans. Asked by the San Diego Union Tribune to comment on the documentary's use as \"a metaphor for family values \u2013 the devotion to a mate, devotion to offspring, monogamy, self-denial\", Jaquet responded: \"I condemn this position. I find it intellectually dishonest to impose this viewpoint on something that's part of nature. It's amusing, but if you take the monogamy argument, from one season to the next, the divorce rate, if you will, is between 80 to 90 percent... the monogamy only lasts for the duration of one reproductive cycle. You have to let penguins be penguins and humans be humans.\" Some of the controversy over this may be media driven. Rich Lowry, editor of National Review, reported in the magazine's blog that the BBC \"have been harassing me for days over March of the Penguins ... about what, I'm not sure. I think to see if I would say on air that penguins are God's instruments to pull America back from the hell-fire, or something like that. As politely as I could I told her, 'Lady, they're just birds.'\" Another controversy involves those who feel that the emperor penguin's behavior can be viewed as an indication of intelligent design, and those who consider it to be an example of evolution by natural selection in action. Steve Jones, professor of genetics at University College London, is quoted as saying, \"Supporters of intelligent design think that if they see something they don't understand, it must be God; they fail to recognise that they themselves are part of evolution. It appeals to ignorance, which is why there is a lot of it in American politics at the moment.\" Author Susan Jacoby claims in her 2008 book, The Age of American Unreason (page 26), that the distributors of the movie deliberately avoided using the word \"evolution\" in order to avoid backlash from the American religious right, and writes, \"As it happens, the emperor penguin is literally a textbook example, cited in college-level biology courses, of evolution by means of natural selection and random mutation. ... The financial wisdom of avoiding any mention of evolution was borne out at the box office ...\""

        "content": "A defiant Trevor has been being tried in court charged with throwing a brick through the window of a Pakistani man, Mr. Shahnawaz. He is troubled with shoplifting from Harrods. Trevor's social worker, Harry Parker takes him to Hooper Street Residential Assessment Centre, where his punishment will be determined. The centre's deputy superintendent, Peter Clive, admits Trevor and he is allocated a room with Errol, a black boy. The next day, Trevor leaves the assessment centre, to look for jobs. Trevor and Errol, break into a car and drive to the job centre. Trevor buys Evo-Stik for huffing, and enters there. He barges past the queue, demanding a job from the attendant. When asked to wait, he storms out and hurls a brick through the window. After escaping, he and Errol head to an abandoned swimming pool where he has hidden some tools. Trevor pockets them, and hands Errol a bunch of keys, instructing him to get it into the centre and hide it. He then breaks into another car, and takes it and drives away. He orders Errol to get out, saying he is visiting some mates. Later, Trevor is eating a burger in the car. Peter arrives and notices Trevor in the car. Trevor discards the sandwich and walks into the assessment centre. Peter tells him to get rid of the car. Trevor agrees. Inside the assessment centre, Trevor does not cooperate. He demands lunch, only to be informed that he is too late. He angrily tries kicking down the cafeteria door. The chef rushes out, but Trevor kicks the chef in the groin and viciously attacks him, before being stopped by care worker Barry Giller (Sean Chapman). Trevor is then held down by the chef and Barry, and locked up in a room. The superintendent (Geoffrey Hutchings) arrives, proceeding to show Trevor an overview of what he has been through and where he is heading - prison. He explains that the assessment centre is Trevor's last chance to change the cycle of poverty, crime and prison. Uncharacteristically, Trevor is not aggressive and is lost for words. The superintendent is extremely articulate and faces little resistance from Trevor. As soon as the superintendent leaves, Trevor is back to his usual self. He rants articulately, if haphazardly, about his views on race, authority, and the British educational and correctional systems. Trevor refuses to keep the peace, and eventually Barry and Peter decide to send him to a secure unit. However, while Barry is out making arrangements to send Trevor away, Peter offers to take Trevor banger racing if he promises to behave. Trevor accepts the offer, on condition that he be allowed to drive. Peter informs Barry about the change of plans, and warns Trevor that he is doing him a favour by giving him another chance, and that if Trevor lets him down, he'll team up with the chef and some of the biggest lads in the centre to beat up Trevor. They go to the races as planned and Trevor is given a chance to drive, as promised. Trevor seems to enjoy the experience, but gets into an accident, after which his car will not restart. Trevor is unable to complete the race. On the drive back to the assessment centre, Peter informs Trevor that he was up against professional racers and did well. He also tells him that he could join a racing team if he wished, and need not go around stealing cars any longer. Trevor makes no reply, and blankly stares out the window. They reach the assessment centre late and have to be let in by the caretaker, since Peter cannot find his keys. After everybody has retired to bed, Trevor wakes up Errol and shows him Peter Clive's keys, which Trevor claims to have picked up after Peter dropped them. Trevor and Errol make their way into the office, where Trevor rummages through the documents until he finds their respective files. Trevor reads through Errol's reports and contract, and finds a report titled \"The Future\", which reads: It seems unlikely for this child to return home, his mother having rejected him for her own lifestyle. Bearing this in mind, future care seems to be the alternative. We would recommend a care order be made, in order to be able to continue our assessment of his needs. He then proclaims to Errol \"You're in here for life, mate!\" Errol looks confused and dejected and asks \"What'll I do?\" Trevor is enraged. He drops the files on the floor and tells Errol to urinate and defecate on it. Errol defecates on his files, and Trevor urinates on his. Trevor and Errol leave the centre, and drive away in the centre's Ford Transit van. They reach Mr. Shahnawaz's neighbourhood and hurl stones through the windows, and scream racial slurs. They get into the van and drive away. Trevor drives to a police station, and smashes the van into a car. Errol is rendered unconscious by the impact. Trevor exits the van and runs away, leaving Errol to be apprehended by the police. Trevor begins walking to Harry's flat. On his way, Trevor looks into a shop window displaying a television, clothes, mannequins and other items. He stares at them and their accompanying price tags, intently. He begins running into a tunnel, and screams \"Bollocks!\" Inside the tunnel, he discards his T-shirt, and screams at a passing vehicle after trying to kick it. Trevor walks past a school, presumably his, pausing to gaze through the iron gates before continuing on his way. The next day, Trevor reaches Harry's home. Harry is busy packing, and is preparing to leave on a holiday with his family. He is displeased to see Trevor in this state. He tells him to go back to the assessment centre before it is too late. Trevor informs Harry of his misadventures, and tells him that he is turning himself in. Harry eventually makes the necessary calls to the police. Trevor is seen in a prison cell, pressing the buzzer in the room. The police officer orders him to keep his hands off the buzzer. Trevor walks away, but returns and proceeds to press the buzzer with his head. This time, another officer, PC Anson (Christopher Fulford) enters, with a truncheon. He orders Trevor to stay quiet, but Trevor continues to provoke him, saying that he is a juvenile offender, and that he must be taken care of and sent back to the assessment centre. Anson orders him to shut up and sit down. He tells Trevor that he would be taken to court in a few days, and this time he will end up in a detention centre or a borstal, not an assessment centre. He threatens to have his fingerprints taken as soon as he leaves the borstal, and use them to convict him of every unsolved taking and driving away in the district, dating back months. Trevor is still unfazed and sarcastically sneers \"Sounds great!\" Anson is livid, and brings the truncheon down, hitting Trevor on the kneecap. PC Anson smiles and says, 'You think you're hard, don't you?' Trevor, for the first time, looks defeated. He slumps in agony and shock, his face reddening. The warder tells Trevor that he is all talk, and decries his protests, saying that he has no choice but to respect authority and obey the rules, like everybody else. The play ends with Trevor recovering from the pain and grinning, as the warders shut the door of the cell."

        "content": "After successful collaborations on previous projects like Beloved Enemy and Psy-Warriors, writer David Leland and director Alan Clarke were keen to team up again. Producer Margaret Matheson, whom had worked with both Leland and Clarke before (most notably on the original version of Scum) was taking over as Head of Drama at the-then newly created Central Television. Matheson was keen to develop a project about education and a series of four one-off plays eventually broadcast under the umbrella title Tales Out of School was commissioned. David Leland, when interviewed in 1998, recalled that Clarke was initially reluctant to commit to the directing duties of Made in Britain - \"he was trying then to do Contact; his mind was elsewhere [...] it was only because we were friends, we could meet and talk about Made in Britain.\" Made in Britain is notable as one of the first British television dramas (and Clarke's first production) to make use of the steadicam. Fellow director Stephen Frears, who at that point was in the process of editing his film Walter, noted that his cameraman on that project - Chris Menges - was a \"huge influence\" on Clarke using the steadicam. Recalling the filming process in a 1998 interview, he noted that \"Made in Britain was written very powerfully, and it had these rather long sequences which posed certain technical problems [...] he [Clarke] found a piece of equipment that liberated him from that.\" Clarke became so enamored with the technical properties of the steadicam that it would be used repeatedly throughout the rest of his filmed work throughout the 1980s, most notably on the BBC dramas Christine (1986), Road (1987), Elephant and The Firm (both 1989). Former BBC director of plays Chris Morahan noted that \"Steadicam was the trigger for his creativity.\" Despite being a production relatively free of complications, problems arose with the filming of the original ending. As scripted, the final shot of the production was to feature Trevor, now confined to a borstal, digging trenches in the backyard with all the other inmates and encouraging them to 'dig for Britain'. As David Leland noted in a 2016 interview accompanying the re-release of the play for Tales Out of School DVD collection, \"I'm a country boy...I assumed everyone knew what trenching was.\" Director Clarke misunderstood the directions in the script, resulting in a scene where the borstal inmates are digging seemingly randomly placed holes. Deemed unsatisfactory and with insufficient funds to re-film it, the televised film closes on a freeze-frame of Trevor's grinning face in police custody. Screenshots and script directions from the original ending are enclosed on the aforementioned DVD."

        "content": "Mouna Ragam (; ) is a 1986 Indian Tamil-language romantic drama film written and directed by Mani Ratnam, and produced by G. Venkateswaran. The film stars Mohan and Revathi, with Karthik, V. K. Ramasamy, Ra. Sankaran, Bhaskar, Kanchana, Vani, Kalaiselvi and Sonia in supporting roles. It narrates the life of Divya (Revathi), a free-spirited college girl who is forced into an arranged marriage with Chandrakumar (Mohan) by her father (Sankaran). Divya, secretly mourning her former lover Manohar (Karthik) who was shot dead, did not want to be married. The story follows Divya's inner conflict between holding onto her past and coming to terms with the present and making a life with Chandrakumar. The film's development began when Ratnam began writing a short story tiled \"Divya\" with no cinematic plans until he finished it. Since production on his directorial debut Pallavi Anu Pallavi (1983) was delayed, he took a break for a month and developed \"Divya\" into a film script, which would eventually be renamed Mouna Ragam. Although Ratnam began work on the script during Pallavi Anu Pallavi, it languished in development hell and ended up becoming his fifth film. Mouna Ragam was the first film produced by Venkateswaran's Sujatha Films, and was shot primarily in Madras, with additional filming taking place in Delhi and Agra. The music was composed by Ilaiyaraaja, with lyrics by Vaali. P. C. Sreeram was the cinematographer, and the art director was Thota Tharani. The film was edited by B. Lenin and V. T. Vijayan. Mouna Ragam was released on 15 August 1986, India's Independence Day. Despite opening to modest audiences, it became a box-office success, with a theatrical run of over 175 days, and Mani Ratnam's breakthrough. The film received critical acclaim; it won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil, and Ratnam received the Filmfare and Cinema Express Awards for Best Director in Tamil. Mouna Ragam also became a breakthrough in Karthik's career despite his role being a cameo. The film introduced techniques such as soft-focus shots, flare filters and backlighting, which became popular in Tamil cinema. It was remade in Hindi in 1992 as Kasak, and in Kannada in 1999 as Chandrodaya."

Her father Chandramouli has arranged for her marriage and tells Divya to come home early from college to meet Chandrakumar, the groom. Unwilling to get married, and hoping Chandrakumar will reject her, she deliberately arrives home late, only to find him patiently waiting for her. She talks arrogantly to Chandrakumar to make him dislike her but, undeterred, he says that he likes her and agrees to the marriage. Divya initially refuses, but when her father has a heart attack her mother begs her to accept the proposal to aid his recovery. Succumbing to the pressure, Divya marries Chandrakumar, but they do not consummate their marriage. Chandrakumar takes Divya to his house in Delhi, but she cannot accept him as her husband. When he asks her what she would like as a wedding gift, she says she wants a divorce, which shocks Chandrakumar. Some time later, Divya tells Chandrakumar about when she was in love with Manohar, whom she met as a college student. Manohar and his gang rob a politician's son. Divya reports Manohar to the police, and he is arrested. She later learns that the politician's son had run over a girl with his car, and Manohar stole the money to pay for the girl's medical treatment. Feeling guilty, Divya bails him out. Manohar falls in love with Divya, and tries to win her love; although she initially rejects him, she eventually returns his feelings. Manohar is a member of a revolutionary group who plan to hold an illegal rally. Divya does not approve, and asks him not to attend; he agrees if she will marry him. On their wedding day, Manohar is falsely accused of participating in the rally and arrested. He escapes, and runs to the marriage registrar's office where Divya is waiting for him. A policeman accidentally shoots Manohar, and he dies in front of Divya. Chandrakumar does not care about Divya's past as he wants to build a future with her. He tells Divya to either sign the divorce papers he has just obtained, or accept the anklets he bought as his wedding gift to her; Divya chooses divorce. They consult a lawyer who tells them that according to the law, since they are newly married they must wait one year to file for divorce. The couple are forced to live together for a year. Having told Chandrakumar about her past and the reason why she was unable to accept her marriage, Divya finds herself finally free from her mental baggage and depressed state. She begins to appreciate her situation and make the most of it. Conversely, Chandrakumar is wary of her as he fears what would happen at the end of the year when their divorce would be approved. Troubled, he distances himself from her and rejects her every move. At the same time, he slowly begins falling in love with her while denying his feelings to himself. Chandrakumar is attacked by his company's labourers because he had suspended their union leader. Divya brings him to a nearby hospital, where he survives after receiving treatment. After he is discharged from the hospital, Divya takes care of him and realises that she has fallen in love with him. She tries to show it by wearing the anklets which are Chandrakumar's wedding gift to her. But before she could do this, Chandrakumar asks her to return to Madras and books her trip, thinking she was simply being immature as she was trying to surprise him by the sound of her feet. After Divya arrives alone at the railway station, she runs into Chandrakumar, who gives her the divorce papers that she had requested, saying they have been approved. Divya breaks down, telling Chandrakumar that she loves him and would wait indefinitely for him to reciprocate, and tears the divorce papers. A pleasantly surprised Chandrakumar catches up with the train which Divya is in, stops it and takes Divya home."

Ratnam took a break for a month from Pallavi Anu Pallavi due to its delays, and wrote the script for Divya. For the first time, he was able to write in his native language Tamil, unlike Pallavi Anu Pallavi where he wrote the script in English and had it translated into Kannada. The new title Mouna Ragam was derived from the song \"Naan Paadum Mouna Ragam\", from Ratnam's fourth film, Idaya Kovil (1985). He considered Mouna Ragam the second film after Pallavi Anu Pallavi to be made exactly as he wanted, in contrast to Idaya Kovil where there was interference. Ratnam initially read the script of Mouna Ragam when it was titled Divya to producer N. G. John, but the latter wanted a political film, which eventually became the Malayalam film Unaru (1984), also directed by Ratnam. He then pitched Divya to G. Thyagarajan of Sathya Jyothi Films, but Thyagarajan wanted an action film, and Ratnam made Pagal Nilavu (1985) with him. Kovaithambi of Motherland Pictures too rejected Divya, and Ratnam instead made Idaya Kovil with them. The film was eventually picked up by Ratnam's brother, G. Venkateswaran, under his Sujatha Films banner, ending its five-year development hell. It was the company's first film production; until then, it was only distributing and financing films. Mouna Ragam was also Ratnam's first collaboration with cinematographer P. C. Sreeram. The film was edited by B. Lenin and V. T. Vijayan, with art direction by Thota Tharani."

He initially had \"someone like Anant Nag and Supriya Pathak\" in mind when he finished writing Divya. Between finishing the story and making the film, he decided to include Revathi, whose performance in Mann Vasanai (1983) impressed him. Nadhiya claims she was also considered for the role, but declined due to prior commitments. Ratnam decided to cast Kanchana in the minor role of the lawyer since he believed \"a certain amount of star quality helps\" when the character has little screen time but is crucial to the plot. Prabhu Deva, who became a successful dance choreographer, made his acting debut in the film as a boy playing the flute in the song \"Panivizhum Iravu\", and John Babu, who also became a dance choreographer, appears as the main dancer in the song. According to Ratnam, the only difference between Divya and Mouna Ragam was the inclusion of Karthik's character Manohar, which was not part of the earlier screenplay. Divya did not explore the girl's past; it only dealt with how she settles into an arranged marriage. Ratnam realised that the story needed to satisfy a wider audience, and decided to give them something that would make them accept the character without questioning Divya's actions, then the film could depict the arranged marriage\u00a0\u2013 two strangers suddenly thrown together\u00a0\u2013 and how they adjust. He originally resisted this, but reconsidered because it provided a clear rationale for Divya's resistance to the arranged marriage. Karthik said he was a last-minute addition to the cast, and described his role as a cameo."

        "content": "Principal photography began at P. C. Sreeram's house in Alwarpet, Madras. The film's introductory credits feature photographs of Revathi from her childhood through her teenage years; her mother gave Thota Tharani the pictures. Although the film was primarily set indoors in Delhi, Ratnam and Sreeram wanted the indoor scenes to look as lively as those shot outdoors. Since the cast was relatively small, Ratnam did not want it to resemble a play and used backlighting for the interior scenes. Tharani found a house in the residential area of Kilpauk which admitted a great deal of sunlight, making it similar to houses in Delhi. To reduce production costs, food for the film's crew was cooked at Venkateswaran's home. Sreeram made extensive use of frontal and profile close-ups, set against long shots with out-of-focus foregrounds. While filming Manohar's introductory scene, he had to lie on a bed sheet to film. The crew pulled the sheet, with Sreeram and the camera. The scene where Manohar plays a prank on Divya's father (Ra. Sankaran), which later became known as the \"Mr. Chandramouli scene\", was shot at Tic Tac, an open-air restaurant in Nungambakkam. Filming was also done at Madras' Presidency College, the Schmidt Memorial on Edward Elliot's Beach, and the Madras Literary Society. While filming the song \"Oho Megam Vandhadho\" which shows Divya dancing in the rain, Revathi tied a handkerchief around her wrist to cover her watch because she felt Divya would actually do that. The crew filmed in Delhi for two days, and the scenes set in Agra were shot in one day. Portions of \"Panivizhum Iravu\" were shot at the Taj Mahal in Agra, and those from \"Mandram Vandha\" were shot at the India Gate. The scenes involving Karthik were the last parts to be filmed, being shot in either a week or two. In post-production, Mohan's voice was dubbed by S. N. Surendar. The film's final length was ."

        "content": "Mouna Ragam provides insight into the issues faced by married couples, exploring the plight and perception of divorce, how societies need to view the desires of women, and questions the agency of women. Film critic Baradwaj Rangan compared it to Nenjathai Killathe (1980), another story of a woman torn between the man she loves and the man she marries, Andha 7 Naatkal (1981) and its Hindi remake, Woh Saat Din (1983). Rakesh Mehar of The News Minute noted that one thing differentiating Mouna Ragam from Andha 7 Naatkal and similar films is that it remains focused on Divya. Kumuthan Maderya, writing for PopMatters, described Mouna Ragam as a \"chick flick\", because like other chick flicks, the film allowed romance to blossom between Divya and Chandrakumar, rather than let divorce separate them; according to him, \"chick flicks center on the romantic worldview of females while gratifying their hopes and dreams usually through a warm and fuzzy denouement\". Manohar was part of a group involved in anti-government activities. Rangan drew similarities between his motives and those of characters in the Italian film The Night of the Shooting Stars (1982) and Unaru. The connection to The Night of the Shooting Stars is referenced when a poster of it appears in a scene where Manohar and his anarchist friends plan an event. According to Rangan, the scene where Divya is looking after Chandrakumar at the hospital reflects her traditional qualities; with her strengths, she is humane and vulnerable. Divya's mischievous nature is shown in a scene where she teaches a Sardar offensive Tamil phrases, which he says to Chandrakumar's boss. Revathi compared herself to Divya, saying that Divya believes in \"living life to the fullest\" and she was once like that. Sujatha Narayanan, writing for The New Indian Express, described Chandrakumar as a \"patient-understanding-and-poised-at-all-times\" man, contrasting him with Manohar who she described as a \"dashing, brave and epitome-of-the-word-'dude. She noted that Divya, like the female leads in most of Ratnam's films, is \"practical with strong convictions\" and the characters \"go through their confusions unapologetically\". According to Ratnam, the line \"Neenga thottaale kambilipoochi oorraa madhri irukku\" (When you touch me, it feels as if caterpillars are crawling on me), spoken by Divya to Chandrakumar, expressed how she would feel on her wedding night. Many critics have mentioned that Mouna Ragam background score suits its scenes and themes. According to Martin Clayton, Trevor Herbert and Richard Middleton's 2003 book, The Cultural Study of Music: A Critical Introduction, \"Oho Megam Vandhadho\" resembled Broadway and MTV styles of singing and dancing, and the main songs combine American music with Indian vocals by S. Janaki. Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu considered that Ratnam used rain in the film to accentuate the \"childlike, free-spirited nature\" of Divya. The sarangi and nadaswaram are used in the music accompanying Chandrakumar and Divya's wedding. In scenes of the couple sightseeing in Delhi, light synth-based music depicts them as modern tourists in their own country. The restaurant scene with Manohar and Divya includes awkwardly played sitar music, indicating the couple's emotions. Spanish music is used for the fight scene when Manohar attacks the politician's son. The Hindu's Sruthi Radhakrishnan described \"Panivizhum Iravu\" as \"one of those only-80s songs that served as a stand-in for sexual tension, where you'd have two people looking intensely at each other.\" Raveena Joseph of The Hindu noted that films in the 1980s which featured men stalking women, hoping to get them, were reflective of \"the times where romances were covert and such discretion was necessary even in consensual encounters\", citing Manohar stalking Divya in Mouna Ragam as an example. The film was Ratnam's first to follow the theme of a person moving to a strange place where they do not know the local language. Divya has a dilemma; since she does not know the language of Delhi, she can barely socialise with local people, and is in conflict with Chandrakumar, the only person with whom she can socialise. Rangan believed Manohar to be the first character in a Tamil film to invite a girl for a \"cup of coffee\", a form of dating. He contrasted it with Oru Thalai Ragam (1980), in which the protagonists barely spoke. Ratnam replied that although it was not uncommon to invite a girl for a cup of coffee in the 1980s, it was not reflected in mainstream Tamil cinema of the time."

The film introduced techniques such as soft-focus shots, flare filters and backlighting, which became popular in Tamil cinema. Ratnam continued using these techniques in his later films, notably Nayakan (1987) and Agni Natchathiram (1988). Mouna Ragams theme of a person moving to a new place where they do not know the local language was replicated in Ratnam's later films like Nayakan, Roja (1992) and Bombay (1995). It was also Ratnam's first film to make extensive use of staccato dialogue; this became another recurring feature in his later films. The film became a major breakthrough for Karthik despite his role being a cameo, and his \"Mr. Chandramouli\" dialogue became popular. A feature film, released in 2018 and starring him, was named after this dialogue. The character of Chandramouli became one of Sankaran's best known roles. According to a Rediff.com article, \"The Most Memorable Mani Movies\", Mouna Ragam was \"arguably the film that announced Mani Ratnam to the Tamil film industry as a talent to watch out for. An excellent script by Ratnam himself, [cinematography by P. C. Sreeram] and a lilting score by [Ilaiyaraaja] made it a hit with both critics and moviegoers\". Pavithra Srinivasan of the same website said, \"It took a Mani Ratnam to move away from clich\u00e9d romantic dialogues and capture subtle nuances that add so much richness to the story, introduce proper, three dimensional characters that lived breathed and sorrowed like everyone else\". Deccan Chronicle listed Karthik and Revathi on its \"Top 10 Jodis\" of Tamil cinema; they \"made a fresh pair and were adored by the youth, especially the college students. Their awesome on-screen chemistry in Mouna Ragam was a talking point back then\".

Karthi said that his character in Naan Mahaan Alla (2010) was similar to Karthik's \"moody yet jovial\" character in Mouna Ragam. Sri Divya called Revathi's character an influence on her role in Mallela Theeram Lo Sirimalle Puvvu (2013). Vaibhav Reddy compared his character in Kappal (2014) to Manohar in Mouna Ragam because of their shared effervescence. Director B. V. Nandini Reddy said that the story of a bride unhappy with her husband in Mouna Ragam inspired her to make Kalyana Vaibhogame (2016), where neither the bride nor the bridegroom is interested in marriage. The scene where Manohar tries to declare his love for Divya through the college intercom in response to her challenge was parodied in Thamizh Padam (2010).  Director R. S.

With the script of the film which he intended to make in Tamil, Ratnam first met Kamal Haasan to play the protagonist, after his friend Kitty arranged a meeting with the actor. Haasan demanded major changes to the script if he were to play the lead role, and introduced Ratnam to his brother Charuhasan, who pledged to help find the script a producer. Ratnam revealed that he was open to the idea of selling the script to a popular director so that he could learn about filmmaking during the production process, but his meetings with K. Balachander, Bharathiraja and Mahendran were not successful. Haasan had later claimed that he was unable to work in Pallavi Anu Pallavi due to his commitment to Raja Paarvai (1981) and around the same time \"also getting into Hindi films\". Ratnam subsequently met several producers. The script was rejected by over twenty studios, including Rajkannu of Sri Amman Creations and Gowri Shankar of Devi Films. Subsequently, Ratnam's uncle Krishnamurthy and T. Govindarajan of Venus Films agreed to finance the film under the condition that he made it as a low-budget Kannada film. While P. C. Sreeram was his original choice for cinematography, the producers insisted on an established cinematographer. Ratnam then approached Balu Mahendra. Ratnam also convinced B. Lenin (who was incidentally his neighbour), to work as the editor, since he had been impressed with his editing of Mahendran's Uthiripookkal (1979). Thota Tharani who happened to meet Ratnam during the shoot of Raja Paarvai, which the director had gone to watch, joined the team next. While selecting the cast, Ratnam approached Lakshmi, with whom he had worked during the making of Bangarada Gani to portray the lead character with whom the younger man falls in love. Lakshmi was a well-established star at the time, and her coming on board, prompted Krishnamurthy to agree to financing the film. Anil Kapoor was chosen to portray the male protagonist after Ratnam was impressed with his performance in the Telugu film Vamsa Vruksham (1980). Kapoor also helped bring Kiran Vairale on board when Suhasini turned down the role. Rohit, the son of Srinath, was a child actor in the film and appeared in Ratnam's first shot. Ratnam did not know Kannada before directing the film but learned it \"on the job\", as he extensively researched literature for the script at the USIS and British Council offices in Chennai. With the help of his associate Shivanand, he was able to convert the English dialogues into Kannada and help Kapoor and Kiran Vairale perform to their respective lines, in a language unfamiliar to them. The film was shot in Coorg and Bangalore, close to Venus Films' distribution centre in the city. Towards the end of production, the film ran into financial difficulties and it took twenty one months to finish the final three days of the shoot, owing to call-sheet conflicts."

The film stars Prabhu, Karthik, Amala and newcomer Nirosha, with Vijayakumar, Jayachitra, Sumithra, Tara, S. N. Lakshmi and G. Umapathy in supporting roles. It revolves around two half-brothers who come into conflict with each other in their claim for legitimacy as sons of a common father. Ratnam intended for Agni Natchathiram to be his next film after Mouna Ragam (1986) and completed the script, but chose to prioritise Nayakan. Despite shooting some scenes during a break from that film, production on Agni Natchathiram was stalled for nearly a year and resumed only after Nayakans release in Diwali 1987. The film was produced by Ratnam's brother G. Venkateswaran, filmed by P. C. Sreeram and edited by B. Lenin and V. T. Vijayan. Agni Natchathiram was released on 15 April 1988, the week of Puthandu, and became a box office success, running for over 200 days in theatres. The film won two Filmfare Awards South, three Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, and five Cinema Express Awards. It became a trendsetter in Tamil cinema for its setting of a new standard in the use of lighting, and was remade in Hindi as Vansh (1992)."

Gautham's mother is Vishwanath's first wife Susheela, and Ashok's mother is Vishwanath's second wife Kamala. Both Gautham and Ashok inappropriately take out the anger they have towards their father on others, and they display open antipathy towards each other. Gautham, a trainee IPS officer, meets the Commissioner's daughter Anjali, and they slowly become lovers. After graduating from the police academy, Gautham is appointed as Assistant Commissioner in the same city. Around the same time, Ashok meets a mysterious girl, and they, too, slowly become a couple. Meanwhile, Vishwanath is appointed the head of an inquiry commission to probe a nefarious factory owner Chidambaram. One night, Ashok and his friends run into Gautham and Anjali, and one of Ashok's friends teases Gautham. Gautham soon arrests Ashok's friend on a trumped up charge, abusing his police authority. Enraged, Ashok and his gang throw stones at Gautham's house, accidentally injuring Susheela. The next day, Gautham arrests Ashok after provoking him into attacking him. As Vishwanath is out of town, Susheela helps Kamala bail Ashok, but then offers snide unsolicited advice about raising her children to be law-abiding. Meanwhile, Chidambaram tries to bribe Vishwanath multiple times, but is rebuffed. Irked, he orders a hit on Vishwanath. On the day when Ashok's sister Mallika is meeting a prospective groom's family for a matchmaking ceremony, Vishwanath fails to arrive, causing the groom's family to question the seriousness of the marriage between Kamala and Vishwanath. Enraged, Ashok goes to Vishwanath's house and berates him, only to realise that his paternal grandmother has died; Gautham throws him out. Later, Ashok learns that his girlfriend, too, comes from a broken family. The Commissioner learns of Gautham's romance with Anjali and doubts his monogamy, based on his father's behaviour. Mallika runs into Gautham and Anjali on the same commuter train. Gautham ends up protecting her from a bunch of ruffians (hired by Chidambaram) harassing her, and he and Anjali accompany her home safely. Mallika addresses Gautham as her elder brother, but before he can respond, Ashok arrives and throws him out. Another altercation occurs at a wedding in which both exchange words. The next day, they get into a huge brawl in public. Vishwanath berates them both, lamenting his public humiliation at his sons' behaviour. While Vishwanath is leaving his office, he is run over by a truck driven by one of Chidambaram's thugs and becomes comatose. Mutual fear brings the families closer as both Susheela and Kamala wait by his bedside. Chidambaram arranges for Vishwanath's murder in the hospital. When his thugs attack, Gautham and Ashok work together to foil the assassination attempt by switching to the ambulance that Vishwanath was in. The next day, a bandaged Vishwanath is brought into the commission's office by the brothers to submit evidence of Chidambaram's crimes. Chidambaram is arrested, and the brothers high five each other."

With this film, Ratnam intended to reach out to the audiences he could not with Mouna Ragam. Despite this, when he was approached by Muktha Srinivasan to make a film for Kamal Haasan (which eventually became Nayakan), he agreed. In January 1987, after two weeks of shooting on Nayakan, Ratnam resumed work on Agni Natchathiram, shooting scenes on Prabhu and Amala such as the song \"Ninnukkori Varnam\". However, Ratnam could not manage shooting two films at the same time, so work on Agni Natchathiram was stalled for nearly a year, resuming only after Nayakans release in Diwali 1987. The film was produced by Ratnam's brother G. Venkateswaran, filmed by P. C. Sreeram and edited by B. Lenin and V. T. Vijayan while Thota Tharani was the art director and Mugur Sundar was the dance choreographer. It is the second time Karthik collaborated with Ratnam after Mouna Ragam. Agni Natchathiram is the feature film debut of Raadhika's sister Nirosha. She was not initially interested in pursuing an acting career, having previously declined an offer to act in Nayakan, but at Raadhika's suggestion, joined this film. Vijayakumar, who had quit films and was settled in the United States, had come to India for a different purpose, when assistant director K. Subash met and offered him to act in Agni Natchathiram. Vijayakumar initially refused, but Subash remained adamant; when Ratnam narrated the script, Vijayakumar was impressed with the character and agreed to act, making his comeback to film. G. Umapathy made his acting debut, playing the antagonist Chidambaram. To make the film more commercially viable, a comedy subplot was created, involving a middle-aged man (V. K. Ramasamy) and his chauffeur (Janagaraj) trying to cavort with a prostitute (Disco Shanti) without their wives' knowledge. While the dance song \"Raaja Raajathi\" was being filmed, two backup dancers did not turn up. Sundar convinced his son Prabhu Deva to do the breakdance in the song. The entire climax was filmed with strobe-light effects."

A slum dweller finds the baby, takes him home, names him Surya and raises him. The child  grows up to be intolerant of injustice, especially to the poor, and wonders why his biological mother abandoned him. The only item from his mother is the yellow shawl in which she had placed him. Devaraj, a powerful don who is kind but feared by most, fights injustice with violence. Surya attacks and kills Ramana, an auxiliary of Devaraj. Surya is arrested for murder, but Devaraj bails him out after perceiving Ramana's felony and realising Surya's cause was genuine. Surya and Devaraj, who share an ideology,  come to understand each other. Devaraj declares Surya his \"Thalapathi\" (commander) and best friend. Arjun, the city's new district collector, wants to lawfully end violence. He is the second son of Kalyani, who is now a doctor. After abandoning Surya, her firstborn, she married Krishnamoorthy. Kalyani never told Arjun of the ordeal she faced as a teenager but is constantly grieved by thoughts of her long-lost firstborn. Meanwhile, Surya is courted by a Brahmin girl Subbulaxmi, who is smitten with his transparent nature. Surya's appraisal to Devaraj leads local people in the locality to respect them both. They continue objecting to societal incongruities. While Devaraj leads Surya to help curb unlawful discrepancies, Subbulaxmi despises Surya's use of violence and tries to persuade him against it. Devaraj tries to form a relationship between Subbulaxmi and Surya but Subbulaxmi's orthodox father objects and arranges her marriage to Arjun. Arjun, in his fight against organised crime, unsuccessfully targets Devaraj and Surya. Meanwhile, Padma, Ramana's widow, makes Surya feel guilty for killing Ramana. Devaraj, understanding Padma's pain, shelters her and her child. Padma, however, confesses she is constantly troubled by the dishonourable men surrounding her. Devaraj, considering Padma and her daughter's safety and Surya's future, asks them to marry each other. Guilt-ridden, Surya marries Padma and eventually wins her child's affection. Later, at a medical camp, Kalyani meets Padma and her daughter, along with the shawl in which she wrapped Surya. After asking about the day he was found, Kalanyi and Krishnamoorthy discover Surya is Kalyani's long-lost son during a suspect identification.  Krishnamoorthy secretly meets Surya and reveals the truth of his origin to him. Surya asks  Krishnamoorthy to promise not to let his mother know of Surya's identity because it would hurt her to know her son has grown to be a vigilante. Kalyani eventually finds Surya and meets him. Surya vows not to harm Arjun for her sake. The long-standing feud between Devaraj and his main rival Kalivardhan makes Surya tell Devaraj, who learns of his meeting with his stepfather and mother  the truth about his family. Devaraj is pleased to know that, despite Arjun being Suya's half-brother, Surya still sides with him, thus valuing their friendship over family. Because of this, Devaraj decides to surrender. Devaraj and Surya meet Arjun, who now knows Surya is his own half-brother. Suddenly, Kalivardhan's henchmen open fire and Devaraj is killed. Enraged, Surya storms into Kalivardhan's house, kills Kalivardhan and his henchmen, and surrenders to the police but is released due to lack of evidence. Arjun is later transferred to another city with Subbulaxmi while Kalyani stays with Surya."

He was then filming for Joshiy's Kuttettan (1990) and initially declined the role after listening to Ratnam's narration of the story, but after advice from Joshiy, accepted. For the role of Surya's brother Arjun, Ratnam wanted someone with a sophisticated look and fluency in English.

Ratnam said he chose to film in Mysore, Karnataka, because it had everything the script required, including a waterfront and a river. According to Sivan, Ratnam chose Mysore because \"there'd be less people, or at least less people\" having extreme adulation for Rajinikanth. The slum scenes were filmed in Madras on a set that was erected by Thota Tharani. The first scene to be filmed was Subbulaxmi teaching a group of students by a river. Because the rising sun was important to the scene, it was filmed earlier than 5:45\u00a0am. By the time Rajinikanth came to film his part in the scene, the sun had already risen. To avoid continuity errors, he filmed after 4:30\u00a0am the next day. When filming against the \"early morning or the late evening sun\" was not possible, the crew used tungsten lights and mirrors to create the intended effect. Ratnam chose to film the prologue in which Kalyani gives birth to Surya in black and white because according to him, \"Black and white gives the sense of this being a prologue without us having to define it as a prologue\". Rajinikanth said he had a tough time while filming because Ratnam \"was from a different school of film making and asked me to feel emotions even when taking part in a fight scene\". Ratnam delayed filming the scene in which Surya meets his biological mother for the first time by a day at the request of Rajinikanth, who needed more time to prepare. The songs \"Rakkamma Kaiya Thattu\" and \"Sundari Kannal\" were filmed at Rayagopura, Melukote and Chennakeshava Temple, Somanathapura\u00a0\u2013 both in Karnataka\u00a0\u2013 respectively. \"Rakkamma Kaiya Thattu\" was filmed over the course of several nights, and was choreographed by Prabhu Deva and his father Mugur Sundar.

The character Subbulaxmi is based on Draupadi, Arjun on Arjuna and Kalyani on Kunti. The film was not originally publicised as an adaptation of the Mahabharata; Ratnam said this was because the \"parallels are hidden sufficiently inside the story to make it work. That is the way I wanted it\u00a0\u2013 at a layer below and not crying out loud\". Venkateswaran said the film \"questions people's normally held ideas of friendship\". According to New Straits Times, the film does not extol crime or violence; rather it narrates the story of a tragic character who rises from slums to gain untold riches and unbridled power. Ratnam refused to name Surya's father, saying the film \"consciously avoids the who and the how of the underage girl's first love. It was the child, the son of Surya, who formed the story\". The name Surya was chosen to emphasise the character's connection to the sun, similar to the way Karna is the son of the sun god Surya in the Mahabharata. Ratnam did not consider killing Surya, unlike the Mahabharata in which Karna dies, because he \"always wished that he lived on. So much has gone wrong. There's so much stacked against him. Maybe there's a bit of hope, a bit of optimism in this, but I felt that his death would look too doomed, too tragic\"."

        "content": "C. S. Amudhan said Thalapathi was \"really ahead of its time\" and called it \"intellectual entertaining cinema\". Karthik Subbaraj said he watched the film during his childhood. Subbaraj's 2014 film Jigarthanda includes several references to  Thalapathi. Rajinikanth's daughter, director Soundarya, said; \"I remember Thalapathy most vividly as that was the first time I went for a first-day-first-show ever\". Mammootty's performance in the scene in which Devaraj tells Arjun \"mudiyathu\" () after being asked to surrender everything inspired director Mahi V Raghav to cast him in Yatra (2019). Thamizh Padam (2010) parodied Thalapathi by featuring scenes with characters who are dimly lit and speak one-word dialogues. Atlee, who directed Raja Rani (2013), cites Thalapathi as the main inspiration that led him to consider a career in cinema. Soundarya has stated Rajinikanth's hairstyle in her directorial venture Kochadaiiyaan (2014) was inspired by his appearance in Thalapathi. Baradwaj Rangan compared Kadal (2013) to Thalapathi, both of which feature a character \"who yearns for a lost mother and who is coerced into a life of crime\". Thalapathi was remade in Kannada as Annavru (2003) and in November 2011, Bollywood producer Bharat Shah acquired the Hindi remake rights."

        "content": "In Mankulam, a small Tamil village in Sri Lanka, M. D. Shyama marries Dileepan and becomes pregnant. Amidst the backdrop of the civil war, Dileepan fights against the government with other men in the village as part of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). While romancing in the forest, the couple hears Sri Lankan Army troops approaching. Dileepan makes Shyama flee while he remains in the forest. Afterwards, the villagers begin fleeing to India, but Shyama is reluctant to join as she still hopes her husband will come for her. Her relatives convince her to go for her unborn child's sake, and they board a rickety boat, journeying through rough waters. An older man says that he has seen Dileepan with bullet wounds in the forest. Shyama wants the boat to turn around but it is too late. After arriving in Rameswaram, Shyama gives birth to a baby girl during refugee processing. However, she leaves behind the baby in order to return to Sri Lanka, hoping that her husband is alive and wishing to continue in his footsteps. Nine years later in Madras, a young girl, Amudha lives a happy life with her father, the writer Thiruchelvan (better known by his pen name Indira), her mother, a newscaster and the \"real\" Indira, and her two younger brothers, Vinay and Akhil. Amudha is close to her father while being more distant from her mother. On Amudha's ninth birthday, Thiruchelvan reveals to Amudha that she was adopted and her younger brothers are their biological children. Amudha is very disturbed after hearing the news and begins distancing herself from everyone else. Indira's father criticizes their decision, but Thiruchelvan and Indira are certain they have done the right move. Amudha asks her parents about her adoption. Nine years earlier in Rameswaram, Thiruchelvan, then a budding writer, often travels to a refugee camp and writes stories inspired by the people there. During one visit, Thiruchelvan sees a newborn baby girl and writes a short story about her. Indira is his neighbour, and has always been interested in him. Thiruchelvan wants to adopt the girl, but is not allowed to as a single man. He marries Indira and adopts the baby girl, naming her \"Amudha\" at Indira's suggestion. A few years later, Indira gives birth to Vinay and Akhil. Still dissatisfied, Amudha requests to meet her biological mother despite Indira's insistence that she can't be found. Amudha secretly goes to Rameshwaram with her cousin and finds her records. Shocked at her stubbornness, her family rushes there. Thiruchelvan gives in and agrees to take Amudha to Sri Lanka to find her birth mother. Leaving the two boys under the care of Indira's father, the trio travel to Sri Lanka and are meet Dr. Harold Wickramasinghe, a Sinhalese friend of Thiruchelvan who guides them. Amudha's increasingly rude and impatient behavior towards Indira strains their relationship. During their stay, they observe the difficulties and violence that the civil war has brought. While walking in the jungle, Thiruchelvan and Wickramasinghe are captured by a group of LTTE cadres. Thiruchelvan immediately recites Tamil poetry and is identified as Indira by Pasupathy, the group's leader. Thiruchelvan explains his motives of coming to the country, mentioning the only evidence that he has regarding Amudha's birth mother is that her name is Shyama. Pasupathy arranges a meeting and says he will bring Shyama to the designated spot. It turns out that Shyama is Pasupathy's sister and a fellow LTTE cadre living in hiding. The next day, Wickramasinghe, Amudha, Indira, and Thiruchelvan wait in a park to meet Shyama, but a battle breaks out there as the Sri Lankan army tries to destroy a nearby LTTE base. During their escape, Indira gets shot in her arm. After escaping and getting medical treatment, Amudha apologizes to Indira for her behavior and requests they return to India. The next day, the family leaves for the airport but Indira unexpectedly asks them to revisit the park. Shyama arrives just in time; after an emotional reunion, Amudha gives Shyama a photo album and asks her a series of questions which she only partially answers. As the meeting comes to an end, Amudha begs Shyama to come to Madras with her but Shyama tearfully refuses, saying that she has work to do in Sri Lanka and they can only meet again when the country is at peace. Thiruchelvan, Amudha, and Indira hug each other as Shyama leaves, and a teary-eyed Amudha kisses her parents."

        "content": "Like other Mani Ratnam projects, the film began production with very little official publicity in early 2001 with the media covering the project as either Manjal Kudai (Yellow Umbrella) or Kudaigal (Umbrellas). The film was reported of a trilogy of films based on love and peace in the backdrop of war after Roja (1992), Bombay (1995) and Dil Se (1998). The film was originally conceived as a taut racy thriller that centres on a script based on a female leader of a guerilla group  - with Mani Ratnam later  choosing to base the film on human relationships with the backdrop of the Sri Lankan Civil War. Madhavan was signed up to play a leading role in the film, with the venture becoming his third straight Mani Ratnam project after Alaipayuthey and the Mani Ratnam production, Dumm Dumm Dumm. For the role of Indira, Mani Ratnam considered casting Rani Mukerji, Soundarya or relative newcomer Bhumika Chawla, before finalising Simran to portray the character. Madhavan and Simran thus shot for two films simultaneously together, as they had also been cast in K. Balachandar's Paarthale Paravasam as a married couple. Nandita Das was also hired for the film, making her debut in Tamil films, and in a later interview mentioned that the team shot for nearly thirteen hours a day. P. S. Keerthana, the second daughter of actors Parthiban and Seetha, was cast the child artiste in the film, while Prakash Raj was also hired to play a Sinhalese character. Mani Ratnam approached actor Vikram to make a special appearance as Keerthana's biological father in the film, but his refusal meant that J. D. Chakravarthy was later handed the role. The title of the film was finally announced as Kannathil Muthammittal (A peck on the cheek) in July 2001, after a famous phrase from a poem written by Subramanya Bharathi. The shoot began in Chennai with a ten-day schedule in the Besant Nagar area. Parts of the film shown to be Colombo in the film were shot in Puducherry. Further schedules were carried out in the forests of Kerala to depict the base of the LTTE in northern Sri Lanka. As most of the cast were non-native Tamil speakers, dubbing artistes were used with actresses Sukanya and Deepa Venkat lending their voices for Nandita Das and Simran respectively. Furthermore, Mounika lent her voice for Easwari Rao's character, while Thalaivasal Vijay spoke lines for Chakravarthy."

Scratcher then kills the captain and three crewmen. He returns to the pirate ship and proclaims himself the new captain, as only he knows the location of the treasure. He soon discovers his predecessor's treasure map was drawn in disappearing ink. Fourteen years later, the pirate ship reaches Ireland, although Scratcher believes they are on a Greek island. The crew behaves gluttonously, with the exception of the debonair and cerebral Pierre Rodriquez (Anthony Franciosa). They abduct an Irish boy, Jeremiah (Richard Willis), whom Scratcher believes can see ghosts and will therefore be able to contact Ras Mohammed's ghost for directions to the treasure. After seeing off the British Navy by posing as Portuguese fishermen suffering the \"red plague\", the pirates sail to Algiers, where Jeremiah is taken prisoner. The pirates encounter Scratcher's old friend Billy Bombay (Spike Milligan) and later release Jeremiah. After threats of mutiny by a pirate named Abdullah (Thomas Baptiste), the pirates end up back at the island of buried treasure. They dig up Billy Bombay's treasure chest of silver cannonballs and fire them at Billy Bombay and his six brothers, leaving only Billy alive. Separately, Pierre, Jeremiah and Abdullah discover Ras Mohammed's treasure. The film ends with Scratcher buried up to his neck in sand, while Billy Bombay is tied to a tree, and the two shout insults at each other."

According to Sellers \"It started life as a straight pirate yarn. But we got to work on it and turned it into a crazy comedy. You could call it \"Goons at Sea\". I think it's what people want.\" The film was the second movie financed by Somerville House, a Montreal based investment company who were interested in getting into the film industry."

Shortly after filming began, Sellers began to lose confidence in the project and when Spike Milligan arrived to shoot his scenes, Sellers asked him to assess the footage that had been shot thus far.  Milligan looked at the rushes and said \"this is on a disaster course\". He outlined his ideas to Medak and Sellers, who approved. Milligan rewrote the script, but Sellers did not turn up for the first day of filming the new scenes, claiming he was too ill to work. He decided a vase in his Swiss home might be facing the wrong way so he sent his secretary to Gstaadt to take the vase back to London. Once this was done, Sellers agreed to resume shooting. Medak shot film around Sellers. He liked Milligan's script changes and wanted Milligan to film during the day and rewrite at night. Milligan was reluctant so Sellers tried to get production shut down. Medak refused. Sellers subsequently became deliberately uncooperative and would often pretend to be sick. On one occasion he was rushed to hospital with a suspected heart attack, only for Medak to spot newspaper photographs of Sellers dining with Princess Margaret in London two days later. Sellers caused further upset by agreeing to shoot a cigarette commercial during one of the few off-days in the filming schedule, drafting in an unwilling Peter Medak to direct it, and then on the day refusing to be filmed holding the cigarette packet because he claimed to be the chairman of the Anti-Smoking League. Sellers had personally invited British cinematographer Larry Pizer to shoot the film, only to later fire him after a party once production had commenced. Sellers also fought on set with co-star Tony Franciosa. \"It's all kind of bewildering,\" said Franciosa during filming. \"Half the time I'm not actually sure what anyone's trying to do. Some of this comedy is so way out I couldn't begin to describe it. But I'll say this: it's an experience.\" \"As an artist, he was a genius,\" said Medak of Sellers. \"As a person, he was insane. He was depressed in real life, like the typical comedian who under the surface is suicidal... He was incredibly manipulative. He created situations where there was tremendous confusion and then he'd gain the upper hand. He destroyed the whole film... On a good day he was sensational but his moods changed. He couldn't remember what he'd said to you days before. But I remember, working with him, there were moments when it was heaven. We laughed so hard the tears rolled down our cheeks.\" After the final scene was filmed, involving Sellers and Milligan both being physically restrained, the crew forced them to listen to a song detailing the production's woes."

But then Sellers called and said, \"I can\u2019t buy back the film because it\u2019s been written up for twice as much as it cost.\" It was ultimately released on Betamax and VHS home video in 1985, and on DVD in 2016."

He is clumsy and loves his children, but since the death of his wife, has spent little time with them and cannot handle them. The children have had a series of nannies, whom they have systematically driven out with their bad behaviour and pranks. They also take great pleasure in tormenting their cook, Mrs. Blatherwick, a former military cook who declares that there will be \"snow in August\" before the family is put to rights. Besides their father, the only one the children will ever listen to is Evangeline, the family's uneducated but sweet-natured scullery maid. One day, Cedric discovers multiple references for a \"Nanny McPhee\" throughout the home. That same night during a storm, while the children cause havoc in the kitchen, Cedric opens the door to reveal a hideous woman, who introduces herself as Nanny McPhee. With discipline and a little magic, she transforms the family's lives. The children, led by Simon, try to play their tricks on her, but gradually start to respect her and ask her for advice. Each time the children learn a lesson, one of Nanny McPhee's facial defects magically disappears. Over time, the children become more responsible, helping their clumsy father in solving the family problems, making Nanny McPhee less and less needed. The family is financially supported by Cedric's domineering and short-sighted aunt-in-law Lady Adelaide Stitch, who demands custody over one of the children. She first wants second-youngest daughter Chrissie, but Evangeline volunteers to go and Adelaide agrees, assuming she is one of the daughters. She also threatens to reduce the family to poverty unless Cedric remarries within the month, meaning the family would lose the house, and be forced to separate. Desperate, Cedric turns to vile and frequent widow, Mrs. Selma Quickly. The children assume from reading fairy tales that all stepmothers are terrible women who treat their stepchildren like slaves; together, they sabotage Mrs. Quickly's visit, and she leaves, angry at Cedric. After the financial rationale for the marriage is explained to the children, they realize their mistake; the children appease Mrs. Quickly by confessing they were to blame for ruining her visit. Mrs. Quickly, intrigued when she hears about Adelaide's wealth and status, reconciles with Cedric and agrees to marry him. However, the children soon discover that Mrs. Quickly is just as cruel and awful as any fairytale stepmother when she deliberately breaks baby Aggie's beloved rattle (which previously belonged to their late mother). When everybody is gathered for the gaudy wedding Quickly insisted on, the children disturb the ceremony by pretending there are bees (inspired by the way Quickly told them to \"behave,\" and baby Aggie repeating the word but pronouncing it as \"beehive\"), chasing the guests, and starting a food fight using the pastries intended for the banquet. Cedric swiftly understands his children do not like the bride and, recognizing that she is not right for him or his children, joins in the commotion himself. Mrs. Quickly calls off the marriage and storms off in anger. When it seems that Adelaide's marriage deadline is missed, Lily suggests that Cedric marry Evangeline; the other children reveal to Adelaide that she is not, in fact, their sister. Evangeline and Cedric resist at first, but then realize their feelings for each other and agree to marry, satisfying Aunt Adelaide's conditions for maintaining her financial support. Nanny McPhee (who is now fully beautiful), magically makes it snow in August, transforming the wedding scene and changing Evangeline's clothes into a beautiful wedding dress, and restores the children's late mother's rattle for them. Nanny McPhee leaves surreptitiously, in accordance with what she told the children before on her first night: \"When you need me, but do not want me, then I must stay. When you want me, but no longer need me, then I have to go\"."

The film reunites Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Thomas Sangster and Adam Godley who all previously starred in the 2003 film Love Actually. Thompson's work on this film prevented her from reprising her role as Frasier Crane's first wife, Nanny G. on his spin-off series, Frasier in the episode \"Caught in the Act\", so Laurie Metcalf played Nanny G. in the episode."

Doctors tell him that no medical cure exists for his case, but that if he returns to Los Angeles he might run into people who know him and could help him fill in the blanks. Rice follows this advice and he promptly runs into people who recognize him. However, he is recognized not as Eddie Rice, but as Eddie Riccardi, a dangerous gangster gone missing, whose past behavior generates mistrust among the police and all those who knew him in the past. Furthermore, ruthless crime boss Vince Alexander (Sonny Tufts), who was betrayed by Eddie before he left the town, is now out for revenge."

In this third installment, Emanuelle goes to Europe to investigate the private harem of wealthy tycoon Eric Van Darren (Lars Bloch), where she watches a naked woman masturbating a horse named Pedro. She then has a sapphic encounter in a steam room. She also meets the Italian Duke Alfredo Elvize (Gabriele Tinti) and travels to his house in Venice. She ends up in a threesome with him and his wife. She also likes to see for herself what really goes on at diplomatic parties, observing and finally taking part in an orgy at a party the couple throws. Then, Emanuelle is sent to a private holiday resort island where women pay for men to fulfill their ultimate carnal desires. There she discovers a couple watching a disturbing snuff film for sexual titillation and becomes determined to find out who made it, thereby stumbling upon a group that uses kidnapped girls for the production of snuff films. Emanuelle takes several pictures with a small spy camera installed in her necklace and eventually gets caught. She has a brush with death, which leaves her wondering if it is perhaps time to hang up her camera for good. Loaded with plenty of photos for her story, Emanuelle returns to New York City to meet her editor, who, however, refuses to print the story and images. Emanuelle is disgusted and quits her job to go on a long vacation with her boyfriend."

Samuel Z. Arkoff said that the film's commercial reception was hurt by the refusal of female lead Laura Antonelli to take her clothes off. Arkoff claims she was originally willing to, but then his nephew, Ted Rusoff, who was sent to supervise the film, developed a crush on her and persuaded her not to do it.

Partly this is thanks to the resourcefulness with which the director creates a visual splendour from little except smoke and light, and partly it's the result of an almost arrogantly complex plot from which fragments of meaning seem to escape in all directions.\" Allmovie wrote \"Hercules in the Haunted World is about as good a film as could be made on a budget in the 'mythic hero' subgenre of action films. If that sounds like faint praise, it isn't intended to be, for while overall Hercules can't totally rise above the many limitations of its genre (and budget), it nevertheless will thrill fans of such movies and even give non-devotees a number of very worthwhile elements to ponder.\" In his book Italian Horror Film Directors, Louis Paul described the film as \"a colorful combination of the athletic muscleman peplum revival and Bava's own fascination with gothic imagery.\""

Raghavan sets out to try to find his son, and he eventually reaches police headquarters. However the police pretend not to know about Raghu, or his whereabouts, and furthermore, deny the fact that Raghu was taken into custody.

A film adaptation of Joseph Kanon's  2001 novel of the same name,  it was directed by Steven Soderbergh, and stars George Clooney, Cate Blanchett, and Tobey Maguire. Set in Berlin following the Allied victory over the Nazis, it begins as a murder mystery but weaves in elements involving the American postwar employment of Nazi rocket scientists in Operation Paperclip. The film was shot in black-and-white and is designed to imitate the appearance of film noir from the 1940s, although it also includes material \u2013 such as sex scenes and swearing \u2013 that would have been prohibited by the Production Code. Its poster is a homage to the poster for the classic film Casablanca (1942, also a Warner Bros. film), as is the closing scene at an airport. The DVD release presents the film in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio which declined in use from about 1953, though the theatrical release, and other DVD Releases, used the slightly more modern but still unusual 1.66:1 ratio. The film received mixed reviews and grossed $5.9 million worldwide against a budget of $32 million."

        "content": "Jacob \"Jake\" Geismer (George Clooney), an American war correspondent for The New Republic, returns to Berlin during the Potsdam negotiations between the Allied powers after World War II was over in Europe (May 1945) but before hostilities ended in Asia (August 1945). Jacob witnesses his murdered driver, a black-marketeering American soldier named Tully (Tobey Maguire), being fished from a river eddy, suspiciously adjacent to the Potsdam conference grounds. The corpse is discovered to be in possession of 50,000 German reichsmarks \u2014 which are later revealed to have been printed by the U.S occupying forces. Geismer becomes entwined in both the mystery of his murdered driver and the clandestine search by both Soviet and American forces for the missing German Emil Brandt (the title character, played by Christian Oliver). He becomes more involved in both mysteries as his investigation intersects with his search for Lena Brandt (Cate Blanchett), a Jew \u2014 and Emil's wife \u2014 with whom Geismer had been in a relationship prior to the war. Lena has survived the Holocaust by doing \"what she had to\" to stay alive \u2014 early in the film this is assumed to be prostitution, but Lena (based loosely on the Jewish collaborator Stella Goldschlag) is later revealed to be secretly complicit in the deportation of her fellow Jews. In the film, Emil Brandt is a former SS officer who had been the secretary of Franz Bettmann, Chief Production Engineer of the V-2 rocket at concentration camp Mittelbau-Dora/Mittelwerk. (Bettmann is only a minor character in the film; he appears to be based on the real Arthur Rudolph.) The Soviets, the Americans, and the British all try to get hold of Emil Brandt, for different reasons. The Americans have already detained Bettmann in a safehouse and intend to transport him to the U.S. as part of their Operation Overcast/Paperclip to have him work on their own rocket program (cf. Wernher von Braun). In the film, they are fully aware of Bettmann's role at Camp Dora and know about the slave labor used in the V-2 program, but want to cover up his involvement (because they could not lawfully employ a known war criminal), which includes eliminating Emil Brandt, whose testimony or written notes would prevent their whitewashing of Bettmann. Geismer, in his attempts to get his former lover, Lena, out of Berlin, gets more and more involved in the search for Emil Brandt. At one point, Lena gives Emil's notes on Camp Dora to Geismer. When Lena and Geismer try to hand Emil Brandt over to the American prosecutor charged with handling war crimes cases, they are intercepted by the American authorities who want to protect Bettmann, and Brandt is murdered. But Geismer still has Brandt's notebooks, which he now trades in to the war crimes investigators of the U.S. Army (who have turned out to be in league with the other American authorities \u2014 the ones who want to keep that evidence confidential to whitewash Bettmann) in exchange for a Persilschein (a denazification document) and a visa for Lena, such that she can leave Germany. Through a minor character of a Jewish owner of a pawn shop who survived the Holocaust with his legs amputated, the film refers to the Nazi human experimentation, in particular to bone transplantation experiments as they were done at the Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp."

        "content": "The film imitates the appearance of films from Classical Hollywood studio-era. Most of the scenes were shot on soundstages and on Universal Studios' backlot, and were then edited with archival Russian footage and archived film from Corbis. Although the finished film is in black and white, it was shot in color because this allowed the use of faster film than available black-and-white film stocks, and afforded the ability to use 'green screen' techniques. The color was then reduced in post-production through the use of a digital intermediate to a grainier black and white, in order to blend with the carefully restored archival material. Unlike modern films that are shot with significant \"coverage\" and mostly with close-ups or two shots, The Good German was shot with 1940s era wide angle lenses, such as a 32\u00a0mm, with deep focus, \"strongly accented camera angles\" and entire scenes staged. Director Steven Soderbergh said: The set lighting was entirely incandescent and the audio was recorded on a boom mike instead of the more modern body mikes or ADR. These decisions, combined with the limited coverage, allowed the rough cut to be produced in two days after wrapping up filming."

        "content": "The Sooryavansham family head - Thakur Bhanupratap Singh is the sarpanch of the village of Bharatpur. The people of Bharatpur respect and revere Thakur Bhanupratap for his blue blood and virtuous ideologies. Thakur Bhanupratap has done yeoman's service not only for the people of Bharatpur but also for those of the 18 neighbouring villages in the district. The local police and administration also obey his orders in the matters of law. Thakur Bhanupratap lives in a grand mansion with his wife Sharda, three sons, Karan, Varun and Heera and daughter Urmila. One of his sons is an engineer, one is a doctor, while Heera, the youngest one, lives like a servant in the house because of his illiteracy. It is Heera's illiteracy because of which Thakur Bhanupratap dislikes Heera, and let alone talking to him, he hates even looking at Heera. Heera is not allowed to be involved in familial matters and performs menial activities like cleaning, washing, herding cattle, etc. Although hated by Thakur Bhanupratap, Heera has intense love and respect for his father, making him an ideal and worthy son, but Thakur Bhanupratap's hates him anyway. Heera is only loved and cared for by Sharda and Heera's close friend Dharmendra/Mindra, one of the servants in the house. Thakur Bhanupratap arranges the marriage of his daughter Urmila. A few days before the engagement ceremony, the groom comes to his house along with his uncle Ranjit Singh, a retired major, and sister Radha. Radha, a modern young woman, is unaware of Heera being Thakur Bhanupratap's son and makes Heera do various chores. On the day of the engagement, when Radha learns the truth from her father, she is shocked as well as touched. Subsequently, Radha develops an eagerness to know why Heera lives like a servant in his own house. Radha inquires Dharmendra about this. Dharmendra narrates Radha Heera's past: During his childhood, although Heera attended school, he was very weak in his studies. He scored zero in the school examinations, because of which he was beaten by his father. Even when Heera rewrote the mark on his score card to make it 100, he still got a beating from his father by getting caught after writing 100 erroneously. Heera wasn't at all interested in studies. He used to go to school only to meet Gauri, the girl who was adopted by Thakur Bhanupratap after the demise of her parents. Gauri was more than just a friend for Heera. One day at school, a teacher thrashed Gauri. Heera hit the teacher and bolted away along with Gauri. He began to hate the school where his beloved, Gauri was punished, and discontinued his academic studies. Gauri, however, continued her studies. Thakur Bhanupratap thought that Heera's company would hamper Gauri's studies and sent her to a boarding school in the city. Being separated from Gauri, Heera became desolate. Heera cheered up on the weekends when Gauri came home for the two-day stay, during which the two met each other. Soon, Heera and Gauri attained adulthood. Thakur Bhanupratap planned Heera's marriage with Gauri. When Gauri learns about this, she attempted suicide but was timely rescued by Heera. Gauri told Heera that she preferred death to marriage with an illiterate man like him. For Gauri, Heera was a man of straw and by marrying him, she would belittle herself in front of her educated peers. Heera let go of Gauri and thus the relationship between the two ended. Thakur Bhanupratap, learning only half the truth, was filled with more hatred for Heera than ever. Later, Gauri was married off to another man while Heera continued to live a sad and miserable life. Radha, after listening to Heera's sad story, is overwhelmed with pity for Heera. On the day of Urmila's marriage, when everybody in the house is busy in merriment, Radha gives Heera sidelong glances and serves him food. Heera, who has not overcome the sorrow of unrequited love, pays little attention to Radha's signs of love for him. Finally, Radha proposes Heera. Heera realises that Radha is a loyal and virtuous woman, and accepts her proposal of love. Deshraj Thakur is another landowner in Bharatpur who has always wanted to supersede Thakur Bhanupratap and establish himself as the all-powerful lord of the village. Deshraj schemes to devastate Thakur Bhanupratap and his family by making Radha his daughter-in-law. If Radha is married to Deshraj's son Arjun, Radha's lawyer father will do whatever Deshraj wants. In this way, he will be able to worst his enemy Thakur Bhanupratap. Radha's mother approves the alliance of the marriage of Radha with Arjun. When Radha learns about this, she tells Heera through a letter that her parents have fixed her marriage with Arjun against all her wishes, and she will hang herself if Heera doesn't espouse her. Radha's mother asks Thakur Bhanupratap to make Heera move out of Radha's life. Things become worse for Heera when Thakur Bhanupratap tells him that if he abandons Radha, he will get back his filial status in his family. Dharmendra persuades Heera to accept Radha as his wife, saying Radha's love for Heera is true and pure, and only a fortunate few find true love. On the day of Radha's marriage with Arjun, Heera braves every restriction and obstacle and carries Radha away with him. Soon, Heera and Radha marry. This act of Heera enrages Thakur Bhanupratap and he disowns Heera. Heera and Radha move into Dharmendra's house on the outskirts of the village and start a new chapter in their lives. Heera gets a job as a labour in a transport company. When Radha learns that her husband has been toiling to make both ends meet, she encourages him to start his own business. With the money lent by Ranjit, Heera establishes a transport company under the name of his father. Soon, Heera becomes a rich businessman while Radha successfully completes her I.A.S. studies and is appointed the District Collector in her home district. A son is also born to the couple. Despite knowing that Heera and his family have moved up the social strata, Thakur Bhanupratap continues to hate them. Heera fulfils his father's dream of setting up a hospital for the poor. In the ceremony of the hospital's inauguration, Heera delivers a highly emotional speech, owing his success to his father, who, he believes, has expelled him from home so that he learns to fend for himself. One day, Thakur Bhanupratap incidentally meets Heera and Radha's son. After learning that the child is his grandson, Thakur Bhanupratap starts meeting the boy secretly. The grandfather and the grandson become friends and spend jovial moments with each other. Soon, Heera learns that his son has been meeting Thakur Bhanupratap regularly. Heera hands some Kheer over to his son and tells him to give it to his \"friend\" (Thakur Bhanupratap) when he meets him next. The fact of Thakur Bhanupratap meeting Heera and Radha's son becomes known to Sharda, who urges her husband to accept Heera back into the family. Thakur Bhanupratap's love for Heera gets better of his hatred towards him, and he rings Heera up. Before Thakur Bhanupratap speaks a word to Heera over the phone, he vomits blood and becomes critically ill. Thakur Bhanupratap is immediately hospitalised and Heera is suspected of making an attempt on his father's life because it is after consuming the Kheer that Thakur Bhanupratap takes ill. The hospital is thronged by Thakur Bhanupratap's well-wishers. When Heera arrives at the hospital, Deshraj publicly holds Heera guilty of trying to kill his father with the poisoned Kheer, because of his expulsion from Thakur Bhanupratap's family. When Deshraj and his henchmen assault Heera, Thakur Bhanupratap arrives for Heera's rescue. Thakur Bhanupratap, before the crowd, lays bare the truth of the Kheer which was poisoned by Deshraj himself with artifice. Thakur Bhanupratap and Heera fight Deshraj and his henchmen until Deshraj confesses his guilt and begs pardon from Thakur Bhanupratap. In the final scene, the kith and kin of Thakur Bhanupratap's family assemble in front of the family's grand mansion. Thakur Bhanupratap embraces Heera and the film ends."

His single-minded focus on his job, however, has hardened him and prevented him and his wife Alice from having a meaningful family life. The costs of Samson's ambition are also symbolized in his assistant, Abraham Thomas, Samson's own former employer whom he treated badly to reach the top. Thomas, now dying, wants his son Alex to have more independence in the firm.

Twenty years prior, their rich father from a nearby town married another woman and kicked the rest of Siri's family, humiliating them on the way. Their mother dies leaving toddler Siri in the care of 13-year-old Sivaramakrishna. With help of relatives, her grave is built on the small land which the siblings inherited, but the Zamindar Narasimha tells them that it is his land, since their mother had not repaid a loan from the man. Sivaramakrishna begs Narasimma and asks for an extension promising to work day and night to pay off the loan, as long as they don't tear down his mother's grave. Narasimha agrees upon security from the local station master. Slowly, Sivaramakrishna turns the tables using his handwork and becomes a rich enough farmer, and Siri grows up to complete engineering in a nearby town. One day, Lalitha, Siri's best friend from school time comes to their house to invite Siri to their house as she is getting married. Sivaramakrishna agrees to send Siri a week ahead of the marriage. Santosh, Lalitha's cousin, a rich city boy born to millionaire parents Janaki and Prakash and brought up in London, also arrives on the same day with his mother. Slowly, Santosh and Siri fall in love, but Janaki does not bear it as Siri is a poor girl, and thus does not meet their standards. Santosh is also to be married to Janaki's brother Srinivasa Rao's business partner's daughter Dolly. When Sivaramakrishna arrives at the wedding, Janaki humiliates him as well as Siri. Both are thrown of the house after Janaki accuses them of trying to entice and trap Santosh. When Santosh learns of this, he goes to Siri's house and pleads to her brother to accept him. Sivaramakrishna gives him a chance, just like he was given a chance by Narasimha when he was a child. Santosh is tasked to take care of the cows, clean up after them, and grow more crops than Sivaramakrishna by the end of the season; if he does not, Santosh shall leave the village forever and never see Siri again. Narasimha and his son are not happy as Narasimha's son wanted to marry Siri. With them, Dolly, and her father trying to get Santosh to lose the competition, Santosh has to work hard for his love, eating red chillies and rice every day, even though he can't bear it. In spite of many antics from Narasimha's and Dolly's side, Santosh eventually proves his love for Siri to Sivaramakrishna and succeeds in growing more grain. However, Narasimha and his son kidnap Siri and then try to force her to marry his son. A fight takes place in which Santosh kills Narasimha's son while Sivaramakrishna violently defeats Santosh's uncle's business partner and Narasimha. After realizing that Santosh and Siri should be together, Sivaramakrishna takes the blame for this murder and spends five years in prison. Sivaramakrishna is released from prison after five years and Janaki accepts Siri to be her daughter-in-law. Siri and Santosh get married, in everyone's presence."

Raghu, being an honest man, tells Shanthi that he cheated on her with a coworker when he was in Goa. She immediately leaves for her mother's house. Raghu, being a transformed gentleman, tries to stop her by apologizing, but in vain. Raghu's brother Vijay, being a good and supportive brother, and Shanthi's brother Suriya, being a non-emotive but supporting brother, meet in a cinema theater. Vijay, being  a righteous brother, blames Shanthi to be the cause of the problem, and Suriya blames Raghu for the same. They keep on fighting at every chance. Meanwhile, both Vijay and Suriya find their own girlfriends in Akhila and Asha respectively and fall in love. One day, Raghu finds a bundle of cash on his table and meets Muthukumaraswamy, the person who kept the money there. Raghu finds out that Muthukumaraswamy is an MLA who is wanted by the police. Muthukumaraswamy wants to leave the country to escape from the police, and he needs a fake passport to flee the country; otherwise, the police will catch him. Since his passport is confiscated by the police, he tells Raghu to get one for him, but Raghu, being a sincere officer, disagrees and calls the police instead. Muthukumaraswamy gets angry and promises to avenge Raghu. Meanwhile, Raghu and Shanthi apply for a divorce according to the Hindu Law of Divorce. Child custody of their daughter Sona, who was in Shanthi's sister's house when the breakup occurred, is given to the mother by the court. One day, Suriya takes Sona to a festival fair and somehow loses her. In the confusion that follows, Sona falls from a Ferris wheel and is taken to the hospital by Vijay. She is brought to Raghu's house once she recovers. Soon, Vijay discovers that Sona has lost her hearing in the accident. Some days later, Suriya finds that Sona is missing. Suriya finds Vijay, and the two get into a huge punch fight. Then, Raghu tells everyone that Sona is in his sister's house. Since Sona's custody is given to the mother, this action of Raghu's is wrong in the eyes of the law. Shanthi and Suriya, accompanied by a lawyer, come to Raghu's house to get Sona back. At that time, Raghu suffers a serious asthma attack while in the bathroom, and everyone saves him. After recovering, Raghu tells everyone that Sona is not in his sister's house but has been kidnapped by Muthukumaraswamy, who is out on bail. In a turn of events, Raghu issues a fake passport to Muthukumaraswamy, but Raghu does not want him to escape from the police. The two heroes join hands to make sure that this does not happen. Sona is with Muthukumaraswamy's wife and brother-in-law Kachiram in a van. Vijay and Suriya both search for Sona, then find out that she is in a van. Sona, after seeing both Vijay and Suriya on a bike, throws her family photo from the van. Meanwhile, the van reaches the safe place, and Kachiram calls Muthukumaraswamy to share the news of their arrival. They both decide to insert a bomb in Sona's hearing device. Muthukumaraswamy's wife then decides to save the child. Her brother Kachiram fights her and puts her in the van and activates the bomb which will explode in 10 mins. Then, Vijay and Suriya catch the van, and a fight between Kachiram and Vijay ensues. Meanwhile, Suriya takes Sona home along with her hearing device which still has the bomb. In the middle of the fight, Kachiram drives away in a car. Muthukumaraswamy's wife shouts to Vijay to save Sona by telling him about the bomb. At the airport, Kanthaswamy, the Chennai Deputy Commissioner of Police, arrests Muthukumaraswamy. As Suriya reaches home, Vijay follows them. Once Vijay reaches home, he throws away Sona's hearing device before the bomb goes off. The movie ends with Vijay and Suriya becoming best friends again after a long time and reconciling with their lady loves, and Raghu and Shanthi also embrace each other with Sona."

The film was briefly reported to be titled Manasukkul Varalaama? (Can I Come into your Heart?) and also featured Swathi in the cast. Prabhu Deva was touted as a potential replacement to Ajith, though Vasanth then opted to replace Ajith with a debutant as he was able to commit under short notice. Vasanth then approached Suriya, son of veteran actor Sivakumar, to make his acting debut in the film. Vasanth had earlier unsuccessfully tried to persuade Suriya to star in his previous film, Aasai, in 1995 but the actor's father insisted that Suriya was finally ready to act. During the test shoot for the film, cinematographer K. V. Anand revealed that the team were worried how Suriya was going to stand opposite Vijay and that they made him wear two inch heels and made him put some shoulder pads. He added that for the first four days during the shoot in Kolkata, Suriya appeared to be uncomfortable in front of the camera and used to tell the team that he didn't want to do the film. The film was the first Tamil project signed by Simran who was signed by Vasanth after he was impressed with her looks in Tere Mere Sapne, though Once More and VIP released earlier. Vasanth signed on Kausalya after seeing and being impressed with her picture at a jewellery shop and was unaware that she had already made her debut in the hit film Kaalamellam Kadhal Vaazhga. The director revealed he had great difficulty in filming the song \"Engengae\", as crowds in Kolkata refused to co-operate with the technical team. The filming mainly took place in and around Trivandrum and Kochi, with some minority portions being shot in Chennai."

In later centuries, Dammakka (Sujatha), the tribal lady, and worshiper of Lord Rama unearths and looks after the idols of Rama on the hill and awaits someone who can constructs a temple there. On the other hand, Gopanna and his cousin Kamala fall in love and marry after a small conflict with their parents. After the marriage, Tanisha, the emperor of Golconda, with the recommendation of Akkanna and Madanna (the uncles of Gopanna), appoints Gopanna as Tehsildar of Husnabad. Thus, a Muslim who had been the Tehsildar to the place is dethroned for the sake of Gopanna. That ignites disgust among a few groups who attempt to murder Gopanna. However, Dammakka saves him while he lies unconscious on the bank of Godavari. She shows him the place of Bhadragiri and Gopanna becomes an ardent devotee of Rama. After a series of incidents, he decides to construct the Rama Mandir on the hill. He collects funds from people and with the help of Kabirdas, his guru, completes the construction of the temple. Lord Rama, Lakshmana, Seetha, and Anjaneya live in invisible forms in the place during the construction. They keep on guarding Gopanna until he accomplishes his mission. Thus, with immense bhakti on Lord Rama, Gopanna becomes Ramadasu. The enemies of Ramadasu pass on a negative message to Tanisha about him, stating that he constructed the temple with money taken from other people without the king's permission. Exasperated, Tanisha imprisons Ramadasu. After many ordeals faced by Ramadasu in prison, Lord Rama, and Lakshmana appear to Tanisha in a dream and pay the required amount to him. Then Tanisha releases Ramadasu from prison and discovers that the two who cleared the debt were Lord Rama and Lakshmana. After being released from prison, Ramadasu is frustrated that he never obtained a darshanam (appearance/glimpse) of Rama. He realizes that Rama is in his heart and cuts open his chest. Sri Rama and Sitamma appear from his heart and heal his wounds. Rama offers Gopanna the chance to go to Vaikunta as a living man, a boon granted to few. When Gopanna asks what is there in Vaikunta (The Highest Heaven), Rama says there is only happiness and no need to pray. However, Gopanna can only find happiness in saying Rama's name. As the only man ever to refuse Vaikuntha, Rama grants his wish: Ramadasu's spirit will remain forever in the Bhadrachalam Temple. The movie ends with Kancherla Gopanna, now Sri Ramadasu, looking down fondly at the temple in the modern day."

Keeravani received extremely positive appreciations for their respective works in this film. Particularly, Nagarjuna's performance was highly praised by most of the critics. Telugu movie reviewing website idle brain gave 3.75 out of 5 and wrote,  \"He (Nagarjuna) did extremely well in the title role. His histrionics in the last reel where \u2018Dasaradhi\u2019 song comes are extraordinary. Nobody knows how Sri Ramadasu looks like and whenever we think about Sri Ramadasu in the future, the image of Nagarjuna becomes the visual aid. The first half of the film is decent. The emotional graph starts growing up from \u2018Antha Ramamayam\u2019 song and goes to the peak by the film reaches climax. The second half of the film is very good. The plus points of this film are Nagarjuna's histrionics, Keeravani's music, K Raghavendra Rao's direction of J. K. Bharavi's script. Sri Ramadasu film comes as fresh breeze when we are bombarded with routine and formula flicks. I recommend this devotional flick to everybody.\" Another reviewing website India glitz gave an extremely positive review and praised Nagarjuna's performance, in particular, stating, \"Nagarjuna is a revelation in a role that calls for nuances and skill. It is no romp for him. He has put in hard labor both in terms of looks as well as body language. The triumph of this role lies in the fact that Nags got the subtleties right. An award is just round the corner for him. Keeravani in a sense is the other hero of the movie. There are 19 songs, each dipped in his own devotion to his art. Like in Annamaiya (Annamayya), he has delivered more than he has been asked for. His songs create the right mood and momentum for the film to proceed. The bhakti rasa is splendidly brought out.\" The Hindu praised Nagarjuna and M. M. Keeravani and wrote, \"Nagarjuna steals the show as Ramadasu. After playing the role of his lifetime in Annamayya, Nagarjuna comes up with another winner in Sri Ramadasu. Nag (Nagarjuna) once again proves he is equally at ease portraying epic characters apart from playing mass, sentiment and glamor roles.  The highlight of the film is the performance of Nagarjuna in the prison episode. Keeravani gives a musical chartbuster and both songs as well as background score and re-recording is excellent and takes the audience into a musical journey. Graphic works are superb.\""

        "content": "Rahul (Rahul Roy) is angry with his dad for marrying a second wife, while his mother is still alive; in rage and in fury he pays an uninvited visit to the wedding where he throws his mother's mangalsutra and all the other household items she preserved. He breaks the windows of the wedding car and is hence arrested and sent to the nearest police station. Meanwhile, Anu (Anu Aggarwal) runs away from an oppressive girls' hostel run by Arnie Campbell (Tom Alter), who immediately reports to the police station that she is missing. The police catch her and keep her at a nearby police station (which happens to be the same one where Rahul is held). While waiting for Arnie, Rahul offers Anu his jacket, which she accepts. Arnie then arrives and takes her back to the oppressive hostel, promising the police inspector that this will not happen again. After they leave, the inspector turns to Rahul and offers him some advice, then releases him to return to his broken home. Rahul can not stop thinking about the beautiful Anu. The very next day, Rahul goes to the hostel area wishing to meet her and spots his jacket hanging outside. Since she lives in a girl's hostel there is no way he can enter. Hence, he plays cricket with his friend and deliberately hits the ball into the compound. The security lets him inside to retrieve the ball. Rahul goes inside and sees Anu climbing a ladder. She is very surprised by his presence and falls off the ladder. Rahul is unable to express his feelings for her so he wrote a note on the electricity bill his mother told him to pay that very day. Anu takes the note and leaves. His mother becomes upset that Rahul did not pay the bill and asks his Master (tailor) to help get the bill back. The tailor helps Rahul retrieve the bill, along with a reply from Anu requesting him to meet her at the main city library the following Saturday. He arrives on time eagerly, where Anu tells him she has nothing to give him except a \"thank you\", but Rahul says no one can stop him from loving her, not even herself. Soon after he leaves, Arnie catches her and takes her to Ooty (another town) to be admitted to another hostel. Rahul employs a spy to eavesdrop and see where Anu is going. The spy learns about Anu's travel plans and informs Rahul, who goes along with his friend to search for Anu and finds the place she is staying. They find out that Arnie actually planned to get Anu married and lied to her about transferring her to a new hostel, because she would not have agreed. At the hostel, Arnie organises a farewell party for Anu and Anu invites Rahul, who promises to attend the party. After the party they plan to elope. At the party, he runs away with Anu and then Arnie catches them by using the police. Anu has to return with Arnie and go to Ooty, while Rahul returns to his home. After a few months, Rahul approaches Mr. Arnie as he can not forget his friend Anu, who he knows is unhappy. Rahul then finds out from Arnie that Anu is an orphan who has a distant relative in Ooty named Uncle Peter who is an alcoholic. Long long ago, Peter had signed the documents to have full custody over her. Rahul asks Arnie about Anu's whereabouts and other details so that he could help her settle (and be more happy) and Arnie (wanting to help Anu) reveals everything. They both find Anu in a miserable state with Uncle Peter and bribe the uncle for a sum of 20,000 rupees on the condition that he signs documents giving up his legal guardianship of Anu. After Anu is finally free from Arnie, the hostel and Uncle Peter, she wishes to become self-reliant and seeks admission in a typing institute. One day, she comes across a job advert searching for a model to run for \"Jean Cardin\" brand of clothes in Mumbai who requests Anu to audition. Anu agrees and wins a sum of 10,000 rupees along with a free tour of Paris and a secured residence. She thanks Rahul for all his help, but Rahul tells her that he loves her deeply and wants to marry her as soon as possible. Anu agrees, but she says she will need some time to prepare. Rahul's mother (Reema Lagoo), on hearing their story visits Anu and offers some advice, as she knows Anu is a lonely orphan, advising her not to marry him till he achieves something in life as equality of status between partners is essential for a healthy relationship. The next day, Rahul comes to the place where Anu is having a photo shoot session. He hears the man in charge telling her to change into a swimming costume, to which Rahul objects. He tells him that they were planning to get married soon and he disapproves of such revealing clothes. He is even more shocked when he learns that Anu already signed a contract promising she would not get married for two years. Rahul is heartbroken by her decision and pens Anu a letter written with his blood. As the years go by, Rahul establishes himself as a singer while Anu is also successful as a model. Rahul plans to meet Anu now, but Padamsee (Homi Wadia) reveals to Rahul that it's thanks to Anu that his debut record was released to market, which hurts Rahul deeply as he now doubts his own mettle and talent. Hence, Rahul cancels their marriage plans. Anu, grieved by Rahul's decision, decides to further her career under director Padamsee, who persuades her to accompany him to Paris. Rahul's mother enlightens him that Anu had refused to marry him earlier because of her suggestion, and that Anu was only a medium for his talent to reach the public - it was his singing that made him successful and popular. She urges him to go back to Anu, his true love. When Rahul comes to stop her from boarding the flight, Anu agrees to abandon the director and stays behind to renew their relationship."

Disguised with a new identity, Tommy intends to seek out unique performers and purchase their acts. During this time, Tommy encounters his father's old comedy partners, Bruno and Thomas Parker. Once great performers, they now work as ghouls on a ghost train at Blackpool Pleasure Beach Circus. Bruno's son Jack is a brilliant comic,  but psychologically troubled. He has also been manipulated by a corrupt policeman known as Sharkey into stealing valuable wax eggs from smugglers. Tommy meets Jack's mother Katie, and even though Tommy is in disguise, she suspects that he is somehow connected to the family. Tommy eventually realises that his father stole his original act from the Parker brothers. He then reveals himself to be Tommy Fawkes and Katie tells him that Jack is his half-brother. Tommy phones his father about the revelation and George gets on the next plane to Blackpool. As part of their reconciliation, George arranges for the Parkers to top the bill at a Blackpool Tower Circus event. However, Jack is still hounded by Sharkey and cannot perform. During an elaborate Egyptian act, Katie gets rid of Sharkey via a sarcophagus, which is then kidnapped by the smugglers. The wax eggs (Chinese inscription on egg is read \"Eight Immortals\") contained a mystical, ancient Chinese rejuvenating powder. Jack had previously placed the powder within a makeup tin, which Bruno and Thomas accidentally use, helping them to perform brilliantly. Toward the end of the show, Jack is seen being chased by a policeman and climbing a giant flexible pole to escape. The pole rocks side to side and Jack spins around  on the flexing pole, and smacks the climbing policeman in the face. The policeman begins to fall and is revealed to be Tommy. In the last moments, Jack clasps Tommy's hand and saves him, both now wildly swinging around at the end of pole.  The circus audience claps wildly with relief.  Jack yells to Tommy, \"I think they're beginning to like you.\" Jack laughs and Tommy, suddenly no longer afraid, waves at the audience spinning past and laughs joyfully."

        "content": "The story is set during World War II in the summer of 1943, immediately after the fall of Italy's Fascist government under Benito Mussolini, when the German army moved to occupy most of the country. The only substantial source of income for the little hill town of Santa Vittoria is its wine. The townsfolk learn that the German occupation forces will be arriving soon, with plans to confiscate most of Santa Vittoria's wine and truck it to Germany. The people organize under the inspiration of their new mayor, Italo Bombolini (Anthony Quinn), who until days before had been thought of as a buffoon by everyone in town including his wife (Anna Magnani), and had only been appointed mayor by the town\u2019s pro-Mussolini politicians as a ruse to deflect the people\u2019s anger. With everyone working together, the villagers are able to hide a million bottles of wine by sealing them up in the galleries of an ancient Roman cave before the arrival of a German army detachment under the command of Sepp von Prum (Hardy Kr\u00fcger). The Germans, when they arrive, confiscate most of the almost 320,000 bottles of wine the villagers had left for them to find. However, the Germans have accounting records that there is supposed to be five times as many bottles. Von Prum comes to suspect the rest is hidden in or near Santa Vittoria. He and Bombolini, two very different men, engage in a battle of wits in the days that follow. The Germans\u2019 search is made complicated when von Prum becomes infatuated with Caterina Malatesta (Virna Lisi), an educated and elegant woman unlike any other in town. She is secretly sheltering and has fallen in love with Tufa (Sergio Franchi), a wounded captain in the Italian army, who, as it happens, has provided much of the brainpower for the town\u2019s so far successful wine-hiding plans. Von Prum orders every building and home and the surrounding area searched. His men find no wine, but they discover Tufa hiding in Caterina\u2019s home. Later von Prum, who by now is absolutely certain the village is indeed hiding one million bottles of wine from him, orders several villagers to be tortured into revealing its location. However, the villagers cunningly arrange for the Germans to select the pro-Mussolini politicians to be tortured, who because they had been arrested shortly after Bombolini had become mayor, genuinely do not know anything about any hidden wine. Finally, with time running out before the Germans must obey their orders and leave, a frustrated von Prum threatens to shoot mayor Bombolini in front of the assembled townspeople unless the hidden wine's location is told. No one speaks up. Not being a Nazi fanatic, and perhaps also because he had been somewhat appeased by Caterina\u2019s having spent the previous night with him, which she did to save Tufa from being executed for desertion, von Prum silently accepts defeat and leaves the town without harming the mayor. After the Germans leave Santa Vittoria, the townspeople, led by Bombolini, celebrate their victory by dancing in the streets."

The script was co-written by Haasan, along with novelist Sujatha, and the pair started work on the project in late 1991. Following a test shoot in mid-1997, the film was officially launched at a ceremony held at MGR Film City, Chennai during October 1997, with Queen Elizabeth II appearing as the chief guest. Touted to be the most expensive film to be produced in India during that period, the film had a proposed budget of 80 crores. The film had originally pulled together several prominent names across Indian cinema as its principal cast and crew, including Vishnuvardhan, Amrish Puri and Naseeruddin Shah. The music for the film was composed by Ilaiyaraaja with cinematography handled by Ravi K. Chandran. Despite beginning it shoot in 1997, the film went through various production troubles and eventually an international company, that had been co-producing the film, backed out. After becoming delayed in 1999, the film has not continued production despite numerous attempts at reviving the project."

        "content": "Following the release of Gunaa (1991), Kamal Haasan had considered directing a historical film and contemplated doing a period musical on the lines of Ambikapathy (1937), with the idea of making a film which had only verses for dialogue. Writer Sujatha then suggested Haasan to look at Khan Saibu Sandai (The War of Khan Sahib), a folk ballad edited by Tamil scholar Vanamamalai, which introduced them to the historical figure of Muhammed Yusuf Khan, an 18th-century warrior. Haasan agreed to the prospect and felt that the story had the potential to make a good historical film, with the appeal of depicting the rise from the nadir to the top of Khan's life. Sujatha revealed that nearly 80% of the film would be adapted from Samuel Charles Hill's biography of Khan, also known as Marudha Nayagam, and to only use imagination where no solid or substantial information was available, such as on matters concerning his conversion to Islam. The team continued their research and developed the script of the film for four years. For the first time in India, the team planned to use a computer for screenplay writing, using a particular software called the Movie Magic Screenwriter with Sujatha working as a screenplay doctor. French screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re and Haasan's mentor Ananthu were also involved in readying the screenplay for the film, as were historian S. Muthiah and poets Puviarasu and Gnanakoothan. In April 1997, Kamal Haasan confirmed that he had begun finalising work on Marudhanayagam, suggesting it would be the most expensive Indian film ever made. In order to widen the potential business of the film into the Hindi-speaking regions of India, Kamal Haasan chose to spend most of mid-1997 directing the Hindi film Chachi 420 (1997), his first straight Hindi film in twelve years. Through discussion with the British Deputy High Commission in Chennai, the producers brought in Queen Elizabeth II to appear as the chief guest at the launch of the project, which took place in the MGR Film City on 16 October 1997. The Queen spent 20 minutes on the sets of the film, with Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, politicians S. Jaipal Reddy and G. K. Moopanar, journalist Cho Ramaswamy and veteran actors Sivaji Ganesan and Amrish Puri also in attendance. A teaser was shown at the launch, with a pilot video consisting of a battle scene which would feature for a few minutes in the film, with the production of the particular scene costing Kamal Hassan 1.5 crores alone. In November 1997, it was reported that the film would cost almost 85 crores to make and would subsequently become the most expensive Indian film production till then. The music for the trailer of the film was composed by Karthik Raja in late 1997, when Kamal Haasan and he were working together in Kaathala Kaathala."

Om Puri pulled out of the film in mid-1998 due to prior commitments and Sathyaraj replaced him in the film. When the film was postponed, the team were still waiting to hear back from actors Amitabh Bachchan and Rajinikanth who were approached to play guest roles. The latter was approached to portray the Maratha ruler, Pratap Singh of Thanjavur. The team approached Napoleon to play a role in the film, but his unavailability led to actor Pasupathy being cast in his first film role. The actor, who has since gone on to appear in successful films, was set to feature in the role of an antagonist and had shot for five days. Furthermore, actor Pasupathy Raj and actor-director R. C. Sakthi were signed on to essay other supporting roles. Kate Winslet was offered the lead female role of Marsha, but her rejection led to the makers considering other options. British casting director Priscilla John joined the team to assist with European casting. Haasan and his brother Chandrahasan visited France to audition European actors and were able to shortlist individuals to portray the lead actress and the main antagonist. Screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re accompanied Haasan to further auditions in London, where actors were selected to play characters including that of Stringer Lawrence. In order to physically prepare for his own role, Haasan went on a diet by eating only eggs, fruits and vegetables. The technical team included costume designer Sarika, Kamal Haasan's wife at the time of production. The make-up duties for the film were shared between Michael Westmore and his apprentice Barry Cooper, with the pair training several Indian make-up artistes during the film's pre-production stages. The graphics of the film were produced by Pentafour Software, whose work had been critically acclaimed in Shankar's Jeans (1998). Sabu Cyril was appointed head of art direction, with Prabhaharan and GK being two of his assistants, while director Sundar K. Vijayan, R. S. Shivaji, and G. N. R. Kumaravelan were signed on as second unit directors. Actor Daniel Balaji briefly also worked on the sets as a unit production manager, having initially set out to work as a second unit director. Vikram Dharma worked on the stunt choreography for the film, alongside an English stunt technician Jerry Crompton. Ravi K. Chandran was signed on ahead of P. C. Sriram and Santosh Sivan as cinematographer for the film, heading a team including apprentices Ravi Varman and Keshav Prakash, while dancer Birju Maharaj was announced as the choreographer. Photographer Sruthi Ramakrishnan partook in the film's early promotional shoots, and was brought to Chennai from Bangalore, while S. Muthukumar served as the film's still photographer during the filming process. Karate expert Shihan Hussaini helped provide security for Kamal Haasan during the making of the project. It was announced that music composing would be a collaborative effort between Ilaiyaraaja and Andrew Lloyd Webber with prominent Carnatic singer, M. S. Subbalakshmi also singing for the film. Classical violinist L. Subramaniam had turned down the opportunity to compose the background score for the film, with Ilaiyaraaja subsequently replacing him. Prominent percussionist Zakir Hussain had also discussed working on the film with Kamal Haasan, but eventually did not sign the project."

Chandralekha, the Commissioner of Tamil Nadu Archives and Historical Research, she began to put together outfits, uniforms, shoes and headgear of soldiers of the 1700s. Sarika and art director Sabu Cyril travelled to London and Paris to learn about English and French outfits from the period, and collaborate with French historians on the project. The pair visited war museums in London, photocopied books and collected archived material written by historical figures such as Warren Hastings, one of the founders of the British Empire. For the preparation of jewellery props, Sarika used metal dyes on silver, copying 18th century designs and original photographs of South Indian Nawabs. For a test shoot in Jaipur, Rajasthan during mid-1997, Sarika arranged up to 7,400 costumes and accessories to be ready, and the filming took place at the cost of 1 crore. Sarika arranged costumes to reflect British and French army officials, as well as Hindu and Muslim fighters. For the artwork in the film, Sabu Cyril attempted to gather as many cannons, guns and shields available from the period as possible. Chandran later noted that, in the absence of easy access to computer-generated imagery in the late 1990s, the sheer number of extras cast during the test shoot created logistical difficulties for maintaining crowd control and getting individuals ready for shoot. During the test shoot, palmyra trees and other vegetation were used to recreate the fauna of the Ramanathapuram district. The team also booked out over 200 acres of land near Irungattukottai and Sriperumbudur to potentially use for battle scenes. To train the cinematography team, Chandran recruited staff members who had worked on international films such as Gandhi (1981) and A Passage to India (1984). Remote-control cameras were also used, with the technology available being the most prolific in Indian films to date."

Official filming began several months later in Velangudi on 10 August 1998 with a scene of where a companion of the lead character, played by Kamal Haasan, is hanged prompting a brief altercation. The first schedule lasted until October 1998 and involved over a thousand extras, while actors such as Pasupathy also partook in the shoot. The film ran into production trouble in November 1998, when a sector of the Tamil community alleged that the film would contain historical misinterpretations of one of the community's historical icons. Furthermore, another section argued that the film is a distortion of history and that the central character would be portrayed as a hero of the struggle against the British instead of the traitor they felt he was. The allegations prompted Kamal Haasan to abandon extensive sets erected in Karaikudi, in interior Tamil Nadu, and shift to Chalakudy, in Kerala, to continue work on the project. Action sequences showing Kamal Haasan moving a large rock and battling rivals, were shot in and around Athirappilly Falls. Further scenes featuring Indian classical musicians and dancers were shot in Chromepet in Chennai. By the end of the initial shoot phase, 23 days of shoot had been finished, with 30 minutes of running time completed."

The film has been indefinitely postponed since. Haasan had invested 8 crores of his own wealth into the project through and has since revealed that the film would be revived at a future date. In a turn of events, Haasan announced in November 1999 that shooting will resume in six months after contracts of the technicians and actors were sorted, adding that a French version of the film will also be released, though work eventually did not restart. Haasan met American producers during his visit to Los Angeles in June 2006 to try to find a financier for the film, but talks were unfruitful. In June 2008, Haasan suggested that the film would be revived after the completion of his directorial venture, Marmayogi, but within months, Marmayogi was shelved after pre-production. A two-minute soundless trailer of the film surfaced on the internet in January 2008, with critics claiming that there are \"scenes which have the grandeur that stuns you instantly\" and that \"the visuals are astonishing.\" Haasan announced that he intended on restarting work on the film in 2012, mentioning that the film could be made within a budget of 150 crores, and may feature contemporary leading actor Rajinikanth in another role. Reports again suggested in 2013 that Haasan would resume the film in 2014 following the completion of his directorial venture, but reports were once again baseless. In 2014, film maker Kothanda Ramaiah made a public call to Fox Star Studios and other large production companies to consider reviving the project. Kamal Haasan revealed that Allirajah Subaskaran of Lyca Productions had expressed interest in financing the project during late 2015, but restarting the venture would involve extensive pre-production works and he would collaborate with Lyca Productions on a different venture first. The posters of the film were displayed at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, signalling the film's possible revival. However, in February 2018, Haasan revealed that he would only work on two more films before his proposed retirement from acting, Vishwaroopam II and Indian 2. In 2020, Haasan stated, \"I envisaged that the titular character would be around 40 years of age, but I\u2019m too old to play him now. So the only option \u2014 if we get the money to bankroll it \u2014 would be either to change the storyline or cast some other younger actor to play the role.\""

He resigns from the priesthood. Hours later, the city is bombarded, and he takes shelter with a mysterious, beautiful woman named Soledad (Gardner). They part. As night falls, Loyalist speakers induce a mob to torch the church, and its ranking cleric moves to hide the Blood of St. John relic by giving his deputy the task of taking it to Franco's Nationalists. Both the deputy and Arturo become hunted men. Arturo seeks shelter in a local cabaret, where he again meets Soledad, who turns out to be a prostitute. Soledad discovers that Arturo was a priest, but because she likes him, she tries unsuccessfully to hide him from the militiamen. Hawthorne, a habitu\u00e9 of the bar and a New York war correspondent (Joseph Cotten) with a platonic relationship with her, does his best to free Arturo. Arturo tells the Loyalist intelligence chief he can make himself useful by comforting Catholic Loyalists who are wavering because of the treatment of the church. Out of jail, but under surveillance, Arturo meets Soledad and the priest who has hidden the holy relic. The absence of the relic is causing unrest in the town and unsettling the local Loyalist militia, now suffering massive desertions because of the missing relic, which is fabled to provide victory to those who possess it. This makes it essential for the local Loyalists to secure it. But because of a well-meaning, disastrous attempt to feed the old priest in hiding, Soledad leads Loyalist security men to his hideout. Despite torture, the old priest refuses to give up the relic's location, and he is to be shot at dawn. The security chief then has Arturo hear the condemned priest's confession. Learning of the relic's whereabouts, Arturo takes it, but claims not to know where it is. He is arrested and taken to see the torturing of Soledad, for whom he has declared his love. Soledad is spared by the arrival of the commanding general, an old man who disapproves of torture and dirty tricks. He orders all 250 prisoners to be marched to the battle lines. They will be given arms to slow the Nationalist advance on the city and cover the Loyalists' retreat. On the march, Arturo gives Soledad the relic so she can try to take it to safety. However, in a surprise nighttime rebel attack, she is wounded. The prisoners change hands, but the Nationalist commander decides he cannot trust them or leave them behind; he orders that they be executed. Arturo pleads with the officer assigned to the task, but the man does not believe Arturo's story. Before the unfortunates have been shot, however, Soledad and the relic are found. She dies, but the prisoners are set free."

He also praised Shumlin as the only American director to make a good film from one of his stories.  In a letter to the paper entitled \"An Honourable Performance\", Greene wrote: Mr Philip Purser writes that Lauren Bacall was 'insanely miscast in her third picture The [sic] Confidential Agent and having given\u2014as she admits\u2014a lousy performance, she nevertheless bitterly resented the cool notices that came her way'. I also as the author of the book resent those cool notices.

Gombo desires sexual intercourse with his wife, which puts his wife at unease due to Chinese law as it is likely to result in a fourth child. Shortly after, Sergei, an intoxicated, buffoonish Russian truck driver, has stranded himself by driving his truck into a river, and is picked up by Gombo, taken to his family's yurt, to join him in dinner. Gombo's family are particularly taken with Sergei's back tattoos, later revealed to be music notation for the popular waltz \"On the Hills of Manchuria.\" Gombo and Sergei become mutually dependent despite their language and cultural differences. Gombo and Sergei go into the nearest city together, where Gombo is supposed to buy condoms; buying a television set and other goods, but not contraceptives. Sergei, a former army bandsman, becomes drunk and sings \"On the Hills of Manchuria\" in a nightclub, with the band playing from tattoos on his back. He is arrested and bailed out of jail by Gombo's uncle who lives in the city. Gombo returns home, and along the way stops to eat. He has a strange dream featuring his drunk, horseback-riding relative as Genghis Khan and his wife as the Khan's wife. In the dream both he and Sergei are captured and killed, while the TV set is destroyed. Gombo awakes from his dream and arrives home with the TV. He and his family switch between watching a broadcast of the president of the US and a badly sung variety show. Gombo's wife, although saddened when learning that he bought no condoms, leaves the yurt, inviting him to follow her with a gesture. Gombo follows her out onto the prairie, sticking an urga (a long stick with a lasso on the end used to capture animals) into the ground in a traditional signal that a couple is being intimate. A voiceover from Gombo's fourth son, who was conceived at this time, concludes the film, and a chimney belching smoke now stands where Gombo placed his urga."

All of their efforts are ultimately unsuccessful, with the result that all five of the women give birth the following year. The story revolves around a wealthy London banker named Gerald Hardcastle (Niven) and his wife Prudence (Kerr), who live together unhappily, sleeping in separate bedrooms and speaking to each other only when necessary. The five couples in the film are (1) Gerald and his French mistress Elizabeth, or \"Liz\" (Demick), (2) Prudence and her doctor, Dr. Alan Huart (Michell), (3) the Hardcastles's maid Rose (Turner) and their chauffeur Ted (Armstrong), (4) Gerald's brother Henry (Coote) and his wife Grace (Redman), and (5) Henry and Grace's daughter Geraldine (Geeson) and her beau Tony Bates (Dundas). All of the couples want to use a birth control pill called \"Thenol\", but none of them wants to admit it. Prudence, Grace, and Ted manage to acquire supplies of pills, Grace through a prescription written by Huart, and Ted from the local chemist, or pharmacist, who happens to be a friend of his. However, Grace soon becomes pregnant, because Geraldine has been stealing her pills and replacing them with aspirin tablets. After Geraldine admits her pill-switching scheme to Grace and Grace tells Gerald about it, Gerald uses the scheme on Prudence to generate incriminating evidence of her affair. Meanwhile, believing that Rose is too conservative to accept contraception, Ted puts his tablets in a vitamin bottle and tells her she needs them for her health. However, Rose is worried about becoming pregnant, so she switches the pills in her vitamin bottle with the pills in Prudence's Thenol bottle, just moments after Gerald replaces Prudence's Thenol with aspirin. The result, then, is that Rose unwittingly trades Ted's Thenol for Gerald's aspirin. She soon becomes pregnant, and Ted tells Gerald about the pills he gave her, but says nothing about telling her they were vitamins. When Gerald asks her why her Thenol pills failed to work, she asks him how he knew about them, thinking that he has already found out about her taking Prudence's pills, at which point they both realise that she has revealed her guilt. Now knowing why Prudence is still not pregnant, Gerald buys more aspirin, determined to expose her relationship with Huart. This eventually works, as do whatever measures Grace took to keep her pills away from Geraldine. By the end of the film, Geraldine and Prudence are both expecting. Eventually, Gerald gets into trouble with both Liz and Prudence. Liz grows dissatisfied in her covert relationship with Gerald, who has been hiding her from his family, and decides to leave him. Prudence finds the letter that Liz wrote to Gerald about her decision, and Gerald finds Huart's Thenol prescription for Prudence. At first, neither Gerald nor Prudence is willing to grant the other a divorce, but Prudence offers to take the blame after becoming pregnant, as long as Gerald will spare Huart's reputation. Gerald accepts this arrangement grudgingly, but before meeting with Huart, he happens to see Liz while driving through town, and she tells him she is going to have his baby. Now able to see her openly, and with a child on the way, Gerald quickly and enthusiastically agrees to an amicable divorce. A few months later, a total of six newborn babies arrive, Rose having had twins."

The film was a major commercial success and one of the biggest pictures of 1926 becoming Warner Brothers' highest grossing film. The Sea Beast is the first adaptation of Herman Melville's 1851 novel Moby-Dick, a story about a monomaniacal hunt for a great white whale. However, the film alters the novel's plotline by establishing prequel and sequel elements that are not in the original story\u2014such as the romancing of Esther and Ahab's safe return, respectively\u2014and substitutes a happy ending for Melville's original tragic one. Some of the characters in the film do not appear in Melville's original novel."

        "content": "At the beginning of the story, Ahab (John Barrymore) and his half brother Derek (George O'Hara) compete for the affections of a winsome minister's daughter, Esther Wiscasset (Dolores Costello). Meanwhile, an albino whale has been eluding harpooners, and bears the scars of many failed attacks against him. The animal's fame has reached epic proportions. One day, Ahab and Derek are on the same whaler as the whale heaves into view. Ahab raises his harpoon to kill the beast, but at that moment, Derek pushes him overboard and Ahab loses his right leg to the whale. Not long after this incident, the shallow Esther rebuffs Ahab as her suitor once she catches sight of his peg leg. Heartbroken at this turn of events, Ahab blames neither Esther nor his brother; instead he transfers blame and an undying hatred onto the whale. The following saga of Ahab's pursuit of the whale takes on the aura of a super-human quest, far beyond the proportions of its first motivation."

        "content": "John Barrymore signed a three film contract with Warner Brothers in 1925 after the success of 1924's Beau Brummel. Barrymore had always wanted to do a film version of Moby Dick and insisted on making this film first rather than the prospected first contract film Don Juan. In retrospect and because of this delay, Don Juan became the first Warner feature to have the Vitaphone soundtrack rather than The Sea Beast. One of the most popular of Barrymore's films, this version extends the story beyond the final battle of man versus whale in a variation on Melville's book. Adding publicity to the film was a bit of early Hollywood hype, unintentional though it may seem: the actress Priscilla Bonner was fired by Barrymore from the role of Wiscasset, in preference for his lover, actress Dolores Costello, and Bonner successfully sued the studio and won a considerable out-of-court settlement. Barrymore exploited the romantic scenes with Costello to their full potential in the film, displaying a \"boyish enthusiasm\" according to biographer Margot Peters, which made him fall out with Costello's mother. Barrymore drank heavily during the production of the film, and his eyes were constantly bloodshot, with stubble on his chin. Producer Jack L. Warner said \"that's a great makeup job\" to director Millard Webb, who retorted, \"That's not makeup. It's a hangover\". The ship used in the film, The Narwhal, was actually a former fighting ship with decks stained with blood from fights. The theme in the orchestral score is \"Love's Old Sweet Song\". Due to the success of this film, an all-talking version was released in 1930 under Melville's original book title, with Barrymore again in the role of Captain Ahab. The 1930 film used the plotline of The Sea Beast rather than following Melville's novel. A German-language version, Daemon des Mers, was filmed simultaneously in Hollywood by Warner Bros. It was directed by William Dieterle, beginning his American career."

        "content": "The Sea Beast proved to be \"extremely popular\" with the public, and was generally well received by critics when released in January 1926. The romantic scenes between Barrymore and Costello were particularly well received. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., whose father was an old friend of Barrymore's, said he saw the film half a dozen times. The New Castle News of Pennsylvania called it a \"remarkable picture\" which \"represents the finest in motion picture art\", considering it to be the biggest picture of the year. The Post-Crescent of Appleton, Wisconsin heavily praised the cast and cinematography, referring to it as \"a picture of rich, colorful beauty of heart-searing pathos, of poetry that sings in action of courageous deeds of emotions as violent and eternal as the terrific storms that sweep through the picture\". Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times noted the \"energy, earnestness and virility\" John Barrymore displayed in the role of Ahab Ceeley, and stated that his \"real triumph in this photoplay comes in the second half of the picture, for he has a great opportunity as the grim master of a whaler with a mixed crew of half-mad yellow, white and black scum\". Hall did believe, however, that the exploits with the whale were not as effective as they could have been, concluding that \"this is a good production and one which contains much interest, but it is not a great photoplay\". Photoplay magazine wrote: \"John Barrymore gives his usual finished performance. His agony is almost too realistic in the scene wherein the sailors cauterize the bloody stump of the leg torn off by the sea beast. It's too gruemsome for the sensitive souls... Dolores Costello's beauty is a delight to behold, and her acting is unbelievably good for a comparative newcomer. The scene in which she first sees the havoc wrought upon her lover by the white whale reaches artistic heights that leave one trembling. And the scene is perfect pictorially.\" However, Movie Monthly was less enthusiastic about the film, declaring that it \"does not come up to expectations, principally because its story turns out to be quite preposterous\"."

Nandini rescues him from the pit, but in the process loses her heart-shaped watch she had just bought. While accompanying his mother to Madikeri in Coorg, Preetam confronts a man named Jaanu. Jaanu, who has been following Nandini, beats Preetam thinking that he is in love with Nandini. Preetam, unaware that Jaanu has vowed not to allow anyone near Nandini, trashes Jaanu and his gang in revenge. In Madikeri, Preetam unexpectedly meets Nandini. He identifies himself and expresses his love towards her and offers to tie the watch as an indication for their marriage. Nandini, who is already engaged, rejects his request. Nonetheless, Preetam vows to marry Nandini if she meets him again. In the meantime, Preetam discovers that his nearly-deaf host in Madikeri, Col. Subbaiah, is Nandini's father and that Nandini's marriage is only a week away. Dejected, Preetam throws Nandini's heart-shaped watch away. But Nandini telephones him and taunts him to return. Delighted, Preetam goes in search of her watch and spots a rabbit, which he calls Devadas, and brings it along with the watch. Since Nandini's friends are due to arrive from Mumbai for the marriage, Preetam takes Nandini to the railway station. The train is delayed by five hours, so Nandini and Preetam decide to visit a nearby hill-temple. While returning from the temple, Preetam and Nandini are caught in rain. An old couple offers Preetam and Nandini to take shelter inside their hut. Preetam, still in two minds about expressing his love to Nandini, grabs a couple of toddy bottles, goes out in the rain and starts drinking. However, when Nandini walks towards him, offering an umbrella, he is under a state of intoxication and tells Nandini that he'd better stay away from Nandini to remain a decent boy, rather than to propose or elope with her. Nandini is now in love with Preetam and is in a dilemma as her wedding is due in a few days. She asks him to take her to the top of a waterfall where she expresses her love for him while standing at the edge. Preetam, intent on marrying Nandini, takes Col. Subbaiah for a morning jog to discuss the matter. But Col. Subbaiah, a heart patient, tells Preetham that he's expected to die anytime and his only aim in life is to get Nandini married to Gautam also an army officer who saved his life one day during  a war. Also he sees the fear in Nandini's mother when she sensed Nandini could be in love with someone else as the wedding was to happen the next day and all invitations were out. Also she felt it would be very unfair to a good person like Gautham. Hence Preetam decides to sacrifice his love for a greater good and let Gautham marry Nandini. The night before the wedding, an extremely depressed Preetam goes to a road-side bar to drink. Gautam arriving for his wedding cemoney, with heavy rains and interior broken roads of Coorg, asks the bar-owner for directions to Col. Subbaiah's home; when Jaanu tries to kill Gautam, Preetam saves Gautam and convinces Jaanu that only Gautam is the best person to marry Nandini. The next day, Preetam brings Gautam to the marriage house as Gautam was getting late and his car had issue. They reach just in time for the ceremony, but Preetam declines to attend. Gautam asks for the heart-shaped watch as a remembrance but Preetham leaves, unwilling to part with it. There is a search for Preetam, and only his mother knows the truth about his love, but hides her worry.

It tells the story of two brothers (played by Marcello Mastroianni and Jacques Perrin) who are brought up apart from each other at their mother's death, then brought together by difficult family circumstances. Described by Elliot Stein in The Village Voice as \"the classiest 'male weepie' ever filmed\", Family Diary is an exemplary adaptation of the semi-autobiographical Vasco Pratolini novel Two Brothers, and won Zurlini a shared Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Marcello Mastroianni gives a sensitive, finely judged performance as Enrico, a struggling journalist in the Rome of 1945. He receives a phone call informing him that his younger brother Lorenzo (Jacques Perrin) has died. Enrico recalls their long and difficult relationship; he was brought up by their poor but warm-hearted grandmother (Sylvie), while Lorenzo was raised as a gentleman by a wealthy local aristocrat. Reunited in the Florence of the 1930s, Enrico becomes his spoiled brother's keeper, forever haunted by a sense of guilt and responsibility towards a man he both hates and loves. Beautifully photographed by Giuseppe Rotunno, this austere, deeply felt masterwork has been acclaimed as one of Zurlini's greatest achievements."

        "content": "Wealthy, powerful, and influential, Seth Dharamdas leads a financially secure life in a palatial bungalow. He is known to come help people who are beyond any hope of assistance, and this leads to him being known as \"Dharmatma\". But Seth Dharamdas does have a number of skeletons in his closet and a parallel life as a gangster and a Matka king. The only person whom he dislikes and fears is his own son Ranbir. After a heated argument over Dharmatma's matka business, Ranbir leaves home for Afghanistan, where he stays with his uncle and manages his business. One day in a forest, while riding a horse, he finds a nomad, Jankura, and a woman, Reshma, fighting. He defends Reshma and they fall in love. Meanwhile, in India, his sister Mona, is all set to marry Kundan, the son of their father's old friend. She writes to Ranbir to attend her wedding and give them his blessings. Ranbir accepts her invitation and arrives at the venue. The marriage commences, and Mona departs after the ceremony. While in the car, she gives her husband a steel ring with \"I Love You\" inscribed on it. Ranbir leaves for Afghanistan. He proposes to Reshma, which she accepts. Her foster-father also reluctantly agrees to their marriage. A fortune-teller there predicts that Reshma will bring death to Ranbir, which has Reshma worried. Meanwhile, in India, a business-rival by the name of Anokhelal proposes a narcotics deal to Dharmatma, which he refuses. His son-in-law tries to force him to accept the scheme but is unsuccessful. Dharmatma recognises the nature of his son-in-law and apologises for his mistake of letting his daughter marry him. He misses Ranbir and orders his assistant, Vikram Singh, to bring Ranbir back from Afghanistan. Vikram Singh agrees, but on the way, he is kidnapped by Anokhelal's sons, Natwar and Rishi and his brother Biradar. In Afghanistan, Ranbir and Reshma prepare for their marriage. On the day of the wedding, they leave for the temple. While in the temple, Natwar and Rishi plant a bomb in their jeep, which will explode once the car is started. After praying, Reshma starts the jeep, and it explodes, killing Reshma leaving Ranbir heart-broken. Natwar and Rishi attack a Matka centre of Dharmatma, injuring him and Kundan. They order a nurse to help Kundan kill Dharmatma. In Afghanistan, Ranbir gets the news of the attack on his father and returns to India. Kundan kills Dharmatma, assisted by the nurse but loses his ring given to him by his wife. Ranbir arrives and finds that his father is dead. He promises to his father that he will find out his murderer and punish him. Some days later, Ranbir with Anu, a childhood friend who secretly loves him, goes out for a drive, where he is attacked by goons sent by Anokhelal. The doctor who operated on his father gives him the ring which he found in Dharmatma's hand and tells him that his father died from suffocation. Ranbir suspects a hospital employee to be a part of the conspiracy and asks the doctor about the nurse on duty that night. He visits her house only to find her killed by Natwar and Rishi. He tries the ring on her hand, but it doesn't fit. Kundan arrives and lies to him that Vikram Singh is the killer and asks Ranbir to kill Vikram Singh. Meanwhile, at Anokhelal's place, they raise a toast for dead Dharmatma. Ranbir arrives there. Kundan, Natwar, and Rishi hide upstairs and position a sniper to kill Ranbir. Downstairs, Ranbir accepts the drug deal, which his father declined and provides them with  5\u00a0million but on a condition that they will give him Vikram Singh, dead or alive, to which Anokhelal agrees. Anokhelal signals Natwar to stop Kundan from firing at Ranbir, which makes Kundan very angry. He returns home, drunk with a prostitute which makes Mona furious. Drunk and angry, Kundan beats Mona. This infuriates Ranbir. He arrives at their place and beats Kundan, but Mona stops him pleading him not to make her a widow. Kidnapped Vikram Singh is killed by Anokhelal. Then they take his dead body in a coffin and meet Ranbir in a church burying ground. Ranbir tries the ring on Vikram Singh, but it doesn't fit. Then Anokhelal laughs at him and confessing that he got his father killed. The police prevent goons from killing Ranbir, killing Anokhelal and his brother Biradar, but Ranbir is injured, too. He thanks the police for saving his life and departs. At his place, while bandaging his wounds, Anu asks him to leave this place and travel to a safer place, to which he disagrees. After which, Mona arrives, tying rakhi to Ranbir's wrist. She sees the steel ring in Ranbir's hands and saying that she has given one to Kundan, but he has lost it. Ranbir realises that Kundan is the main culprit in the death of his father. He wants to kill him but is in a fix because he does not want to make his sister a widow. Mona and Kundan return home, where they find Natwar and Rishi already present. Kundan signals Mona to go upstairs. Natwar and Rishi blackmail Kundan that they will expose that he was the main culprit behind his father-in-law's death. They demand him to find a path for Ranbir's death. Mona hears this conversation and informs about this to Ranbir. Kundan sees her doing all this. Ranbir and Shakti Singh (Dara Singh), a top henchman of his father, arrive at their place and find Mona dead. A mourning Ranbir receives a call from Kundan asking Ranbir to meet him at his hideout in Madh Island. Meanwhile, he plans to kill him and Shakti Singh. Ranbir accepts and arrives, only to find a bunch of goons with machine guns there to kill him and Shakti Singh. Kundan lands in a helicopter in a hilly place with a small cottage where Natwar and Rishi are present. They ask him about their safe house, to which he says that a ship in the sea waiting for their arrival, and then he asks them about the narcotics. They reply that it is in the cottage. He asks its worth, to which they reply that it is full 5\u00a0million. Then he kills them and takes the carton of drugs from the cottage back to the helicopter, where he finds Ranbir. He is astonished to see him alive and confesses to him about the plan according to which he killed his father. Then he is forced to commit suicide by Ranbir by jumping off from the hill. After that, Ranbir closes all Matka's rackets across the world, which were led by his father, and hands over all the black money earned by his father to the police. He leaves with his mother and Anu, now his wife, to Afghanistan to continue his old work there."

        "content": "Mullum Malarum (; ) is a 1978 Indian Tamil-language drama film written and directed by Mahendran. Produced by Venu Chettiar and V. Mohan, the film stars Rajinikanth, Sarath Babu, Jayalaxmi and Shoba. It marks Mahendran's directorial debut and is partly based on Uma Chandran's novel of the same name, which was serialised in the Tamil magazine Kalki in 1966. Mullum Malarum tells the story of Kali (Rajinikanth), a winch operator of a cable trolley who dotes on his sister Valli (Shoba) since they were orphaned, and clashes with his boss Kumaran (Sarath Babu). Mahendran read only part of the novel, and developed the screenplay as he wanted, making a visually-focused film without formulaic Tamil cinema conventions he disliked such as melodrama, overacting, excessive dialogue and duets. Since Mahendran had no previous directing experience, cinematographer Balu Mahendra, who was already an established director, assisted him with the screenplay, dialogue, camera angles, casting and editing. Principal photography lasted for about 30 days, taking place primarily in Sringeri, Karnataka, though some scenes were also filmed in Ooty, Tamil Nadu. The film was edited by D. Vasu, and the soundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraaja. Mullum Malarum was released on 15 August 1978. Although it opened to tepid box-office earnings, positive reviews from critics and favourable word of mouth in later weeks helped make it a success with a theatrical run of over 100 days. The film received praise primarily for Rajinikanth's performance, Balu Mahendra's cinematography, Ilaiyaraaja's music, Mahendran's writing and establishing Tamil cinema as a \"visual medium\". It won the Filmfare Award for Best Film\u00a0\u2013 Tamil, the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Film and Rajinikanth won the Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize for his performance. Mullum Malarum became a breakthrough for Rajinikanth as an actor and a milestone of Tamil cinema for focusing prominently on visuals and realism without the formulaic Tamil cinema conventions that Mahendran disliked. He continued following this style in all his later films. The film's success inspired a Malayalam remake titled Venalil Oru Mazha in 1979, a Telugu remake titled Seethamma Pelli in 1984, and a Hindi version titled Pyari Behna in 1985."

        "content": "Orphaned at a young age, Kali and his sister Valli grew up on the streets and were street performers. Kali played the drums and Valli perched herself atop a pole balanced by an older boy. Kali frequently gets angry at people whom he thinks lack empathy for the socially or financially deprived. As adults, the siblings live in a hilltop village where Kali works for a powerhouse in the valley below. From a shed in the village, he operates a winch for a cable trolley which ferries employees to work. The powerhouse's new divisional engineer, the rule-abiding but fair Kumaran, notices Kali offering free rides to unauthorised townspeople. When he orders the passengers out, citing rules of operation, Kali becomes angry and stops the trolley half-way downhill. Kumaran shrugs off this act with a knowing smile. On a nearby canal's bank, Valli meets a young woman, Manga, who, along with her mother, has arrived from a drought-stricken town, Ilaiyangudi. The mother is looking for work, and both women are hungry\u2014Manga ravenously so, a fondness for food becoming one of her primary characteristics. Valli feeds and shelters them for the night, and asks Kali about allowing them to use the vacant house next door. Meanwhile, Kali roughs up his fellow employees whom he suspects of snitching on him to Kumaran. Kali is given a final warning by Kumaran as a prelude to serious disciplinary action. While Kali is at work, Manga appears, picks up his watch and teasingly declares she will run away with it. A chase ensues, taking them through the woods and into the river. Waist-deep in the water, Kali retrieves the watch and rushes back to the shed. During his absence, a child living in the valley has needed medical attention. After the emergency alarm at the shed has rung for several minutes, a passerby steps in to operate the winch. The child is transported back in the trolley and dispatched to a hospital. The following day, Kumaran suspends Kali from his job for ten days for gross misconduct. That evening, Kali goes to the nearby Mullimalai to assuage his anger at Kumaran among the Badagas, joining them in singing and dancing. While staggering back home drunk, Kali passes out on an unlit street. A truck drives over his left arm, which is amputated at a city hospital. As a result, Kumaran regretfully fires Kali since he can no longer perform his job adequately with one arm. At Valli's prompting, Kali and Manga agree to marry; they have a simple wedding ceremony held at the local temple. Kumaran attends and brings a present of cash, which Kali rejects, but Manga accepts. Kumaran becomes attracted to Valli. After determining her willingness for marriage, he requests permission from Kali who asks him to return the following day. Later that day, Kali corners Murgesa, a local grocer who is known for flirtatious behaviour, and offers him his sister's hand in marriage. An engagement ceremony for Murgesa and Valli is arranged. At the ceremony, Manga angrily interferes in the main ritual, which makes Kali furious at his wife. He physically assaults her repeatedly, but Manga remains firm in her opposition. The next day, Manga convinces Kumaran and Valli to marry without Kali's knowledge, but he accosts their wedding party on its way to the temple. Kali accuses his sister of abandoning him because of his handicap. Valli is filled with guilt and rushes into his arm. Kali reminds the onlookers that he remains the most important man in his sister's life. Although he still dislikes Kumaran, Kali's self-esteem is restored, and he offers his blessings for the marriage."

        "content": "Despite the success of his projects in the 1970s including Thangappathakkam (1974) and Aadu Puli Attam (1977), screenwriter Mahendran had become disillusioned with the mainstream Tamil cinema, which he criticised for its obsession with commercial success, routine melodrama, excessive dialogues, duets and a typical climax. He decided to take a sabbatical from screenwriting, but was under constant pressure from film producers to write for them. It was then that Mahendran began soliciting novels to adapt, one of which was Uma Chandran's Mullum Malarum (1966). First serialised in the Tamil magazine Kalki, it won the first prize in Kalkis novel competition for the magazine's silver jubilee in 1966. While reading the novel, Mahendran was attracted by the protagonist Kali's job as a winch operator and his highly self-respecting character. He read until the chapter where Kali loses his arm to a tiger, and developed the screenplay completely according to his own wish. Unlike the novel, in Mahendran's screenplay Kali loses his arm when it is run over by a truck. Additionally, the novel ends with the deaths of Kali and his wife Manga, which Mahendran did not include in his screenplay. Upon completion, Mahendran did not immediately pitch his story to investors, but instead \"quietly filed it away\", as he believed that no producer would want to produce a film that lacked all the formulaic Tamil cinema conventions. It was only after Venu Chettiar of Ananthi Films approached Mahendran with an offer that he pitched Mullum Malarum, describing it as a brother and sister story. Chettiar accepted the story without listening to it fully and wanted Mahendran to both write and direct the film. Under the assumption that Chettiar had only accepted due to his belief that Mahendran would make a melodramatic brother-sister film like Pasamalar (1961), Mahendran refrained from disclosing to him that what he envisioned was radically different, with more focus on visuals than dramatics. The film marked Mahendran's directorial debut, with Chettiar and V. Mohan producing it. Ramasamy was signed as the art director, and D. Vasu as the editor. Ramachandra Babu declined when approached by Mahendran to be the cinematographer, and Ashok Kumar, whom Ramachandra Babu suggested, could not accept to work on the film. Mahendran was unable to find a worthy cinematographer until actor Kamal Haasan introduced him to Balu Mahendra, who agreed to work on the film, making his debut in Tamil cinema. Haasan worked as a production manager on the film."

        "content": "After the release of Aadu Puli Attam, Mahendran wanted Rajinikanth, who portrayed the film's antagonist, to act as the male lead in his directorial debut film. Though Chettiar remonstrated against the actor's suitability for the role due to his dark skin and typecasting as a villain, he reluctantly capitulated after Mahendran intransigently declared that he could not possibly direct the film without him, believing him to be tailor-made for the part. After directing the Kannada film Kokila (1977), Balu Mahendra wanted its lead actress Shoba to act in his first Tamil film. She was eventually cast as Kali's sister Valli. Mullum Malarum was filmed on 35 mm ORWO colour film. It was shot primarily in Sringeri, Karnataka, with additional filming in Ooty, Tamil Nadu; principal photography lasted about 30 days. Chettiar initially refused to let Mahendran shoot in Sringeri, citing financial constraints, but Mahendran's friend Pazhaniappan convinced Chettiar and agreed to pay for the Sringeri shooting schedule. Once while passing through Pondicherry, Mahendran witnessed a game of Uriyadi, which inspired him to include two Uriyadi scenes in the film which were not originally part of the script. Mahendran also decided to characterise Manga (Jayalaxmi) as a \"meen paithiyam\" (meaning a \"foodie who loves fish\") after being inspired by Sringeri's marine environment. Balu Mahendra stated that he avoided incorporating the usual hero-heroine dancing into the film because he thought it was like \"watching two drunken monkeys dancing\". Instead, he allocated music to the background when the lead characters expressed their emotions. Since Mahendran had no previous directing experience, Balu Mahendra, who was already an established director, assumed responsibility and responded to Mahendran's suggestions for screenplay, dialogue, camera angles, casting and editing. He shot the film predominantly using natural light. According to Mahendran, Chettiar never arrived at the shooting spot; he expected a melodramatic, dialogue-heavy film, and would have shelved the project had he known about Mahendran's filmmaking style. Sarath Babu was originally supposed to lip sync the full \"Senthazham Poovil\" scene, picturised on his character Kumaran and Valli, but Mahendra and Mahendran agreed on a montage after the actor performed a line or two. During the filming of the climax where Kali lets Kumaran marry Valli despite their enmity, Sarath Babu disputed the part where Kali professes to still dislike Kumaran, leading him to storm off the set. When he was brought back by the producer, he tempestuously confronted Mahendran, who informed him that Kali dislikes Kumaran till the end. He offered the possibility of filming it with Kali saying those words without Kumaran present, but Sarath Babu ultimately appeared. After watching the film's double positive, Chettiar was perplexed by the lack of melodrama and lengthy dialogues, since he hired Mahendran as director due to his success as a dialogue writer and did not expect such a visually-focused film. At that time, Mahendran had yet to film a scene set before \"Senthazham Poovil\" but Chettiar, discontent with the budget escalating, refused to finance it until he was won over by Haasan who financed the scene, and filming was completed. Mullum Malarum final reel length was ."

        "content": "Film critic Naman Ramachandran likened Kali's relationship with Valli to how flowers need thorns for protection. According to critic Baradwaj Rangan, the title Mullum Malarum can be interpreted in two ways: \"the thorn and the flower\", which describes Kali and Valli; and \"even a thorn will bloom\", which foreshadows how Kali softens at the end. Mahendran considered the latter to be the real meaning of the film's title. S. Rajanayagam, author of the 2015 book Popular Cinema and Politics in South India: The Films of MGR and Rajinikanth, described Kali as the thorn and flower in the film; he characterised Kali as an \"angry young man with a kind heart\" who does not admit mistakes, despite having committed acts such as breaking car headlights and allowing people to ride the trolley, in violation of the powerhouse's rules. He noted that films like Mullum Malarum stereotype the poor as \"all that is pristine and traditional\", and leave the \"overall socio-economic system\" which made them poor unchallenged, but within this system, \"the hero will be 'richer' in terms of his moral uprightness\". Journalist Kavitha Muralidharan wrote that most of Mahendran's films show characters with contrasting personalities, citing the docile Valli and the garrulous Manga in Mullum Malarum as examples. Regarding this, Mahendran said, \"I only show them as they are in real life\". According to film historian Yves Thoraval, Mullum Malarum explores \"the extreme Oedipal possessiveness of a married brother for his younger sister\". Thoraval said this was a recurring theme in Indian films starting with Bahen in 1941. Ramachandran noted that Kali, like Rajinikanth's character in Bairavi (1978), is responsible for his sister's welfare. Unlike Bairavi, the siblings in Mullum Malarum are not separated; this leads Kali's protectiveness of Valli to the brink of obsession. Ramachandran regarded egotism as one of Mullum Malarum central themes, identifying Kali as the alpha male of his community. According to an article published in Cinema Vision India, the film stresses \"that people changeand they must\". Ramachandran noted that when Kali's arm is amputated, he feels helpless and emasculated, and Kumaran becomes an easy target. Kali refuses to see the benefits of his sister marrying a wealthy and educated man, even when Manga asks for his consent, but sees the error of his ways when Valli abandons her wedding party to join her brother: \"My sister has shown all of you that I am the most important person in her life. I need only that happiness for the rest of my life. And it is with that pride and arrogance that I give my permission for my sister to marry\". Writing for Frontline, Venkatesh Chakravarthy noted that the film ends with Kali relenting to Valli's desire to marry the man she wishes but not before he tells Kumaran that he still dislikes him, \"which makes the film open-ended with a feel that life goes on\"."

During its third or fourth week of release, positive magazine reviews and favourable word of mouth spread; Mullum Malarum became a commercial success, with a theatrical run of over 100 days. Chettiar later apologised to Mahendran, who in turn thanked him for letting him make the film. After watching the film and being impressed with Rajinikanth's performance, his mentor, director K.

The writer of a 25 August 1978 review in The Hindu appreciated the film for not having the \"usual formula of fights, duets, intrigues and cabaret dances\". The reviewer further noted that Rajinikanth showed \"his mature artistry in a portrayal of a turbulent illiterate worker with a blind passion for his sister\". The reviewer also praised the performances of Shoba and Jayalaxmi, called Balu Mahendra's camera work a \"feast for the eyes\", and Ilaiyaraaja's melodies \"delicious\". The critic was disappointed of the film's first half for moving at a \"leisurely pace\", but said the second half was \"eventful\". The Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan, in its 3 September 1978 review, applauded the performances of Rajinikanth and Sarath Babu, along with Balu Mahendra's cinematography and Ilaiyaraaja's music. The reviewer also praised Mahendran's filmmaking skills and the fact that he told the story in a sharp manner without long dialogues, likening the film to Kurinchi flowers due to their rarity and rating it 61 out of 100. After watching the film, M. G. Ramachandran\u2014the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu\u2014told Mahendran that he had no words to express his happiness, and that Mahendran set a new trend in Tamil cinema with Mullum Malarum. Ramachandran stated that Mahendran had reached a milestone beyond expectations. He added that Mahendran demonstrated clearly that cinema is a \"visual medium\". Ramachandran commented that the depiction of brother-sister relationships in film up to this point were full of dramatics, even in his own, but Mullum Malarum stood apart in its realism. He said the final scene was new not only to Tamil cinema but also to Indian cinema. Ramachandran lauded Rajinikanth's realistic acting and hoped the \ufb01lm would mark a big turnaround in his career. K.

Mahendran continued following this style in all his later films. According to K. Balamurugan of Rediff.com, the film established that Rajinikanth \"can be a director's actor too\" and widened his fan base \"from youngsters to the families and the women\". In December 2013, The Times of India said that with this film, Rajinikanth \"dispelled whatever doubts remained about his acting ability\". Rajinikanth himself considers Mullum Malarum one of his five most favourite films and Mahendran his favourite director. Mullum Malarum was remade in Malayalam as Venalil Oru Mazha in 1979, in Telugu as Seethamma Pelli in 1984 (despite the dubbed Telugu version in 1979) and in Hindi as Pyari Behna (1985). \"Kali\" (alternatively, Kaali) became Rajinikanth's most-frequent onscreen name; his characters in Kaali (1980), Kai Kodukkum Kai (1984) and Petta (2019) also shared that name. In October 2015, director Pa. Ranjith said that Rajinikanth's characterisation in Mullum Malarum was a \"lesson\" of sorts for him, and the actor's character in Ranjith's Kabali (2016) was influenced by Kali in Mullum Malarum. The film's score has been regarded as one of the best of Ilaiyaraaja's career by commentators; the songs \"Senthazham Poovil\" and \"Raman Aandalum\" in particular, remain hugely popular.

Irma goes to the sugar refinery and drops off Aldo's lunch, but does not stay to talk with him. Concerned about her behavior, Aldo goes back to the house where they discuss her husband's death. Aldo suggests that after seven years they can finally get married and legitimize their daughter, Rosina (Mirna Girardi). The next day, Irma reveals that she loves someone else. Aldo can hardly believe her words, saying, \"All these years, nothing was true.\" In the coming days he tries desperately to change her mind but it is no use, and the relationship ends with him slapping her in public. Distraught and disillusioned, Aldo leaves Goriano with their daughter Rosina and the two start wandering throughout the Po valley. They stop at the house of his former girlfriend, Elvia (Betsy Blair), a forlorn seamstress who still loves him. He flatters her and helps repair a racing boat owned by the boyfriend of Elvia's younger sister, Edera (Gabriella Pallotta). Later he spends time with Elvia and his daughter watching the river race, with Elvia holding Aldo's arm, but Aldo cannot hide his depression for long. Irma shows up at Elvia's house to deliver Aldo's valise. Elvia has little sympathy for Irma, believing she will regret throwing away her relationship with Aldo. That night Elvia and Aldo go to a dance and have a good time, but Elvia asks to leave early so she can talk with him. Upset that Aldo returned to her only after Irma broke off their relationship, she tells him she received his valise from Irma (but not mentioning Irma's visit). After Aldo explodes in anger at Irma's actions, they both realize his visit was a mistake. Later that evening, Edera returns from the dance a little drunk and flirtatious, and they kiss, but Aldo can only think about Irma. Aldo and his daughter leave early the next morning. Elvia tells her younger sister she is sad to see him go. Aldo is unsuccessful in finding work along the Po valley. When Rosina is almost hit by a car, Aldo slaps her face in front of a school yard of children, humiliating her. She runs off and walks among a group of men from the insane asylum. Her father retrieves her and they get a ride atop a petrol truck, but are forced to disembark before a police check point near a filling station. The truck driver tells Aldo that he'll pick him up the following day when the police are not around. Aldo meets Virginia (Dorian Gray), the attractive widow who runs the filling station, and asks if he and his daughter can stay until he can get a ride. Virginia offers him the shack next to the station and he accepts. The next morning Virginia offers Aldo a job. The truck from the previous day approaches and the driver asks if Aldo still wants the ride, but he declines, choosing to stay. That night their mutual attraction is undeniable and they consummate their desires. The next morning while Aldo and Virginia continue their lovemaking, Rosina goes off with Virginia's father who harasses the new owner of his farm which Virginia recently sold. The new owner complains to Virginia about her father's behavior. Frustrated by her father's erratic behavior, Virginia decides to put him in a retirement home. Later that day Aldo and Virginia make love in an open field partially hidden by large wooden cable spools while Rosina plays nearby. When Rosina discovers them in their passion, she runs off upset. Back at the house, Virginia suggests they can no longer take care of Rosina, and soon Aldo puts her on a bus back to her mother. As the bus pulls away Aldo runs after her saying, \"I won't forget you ... remember that I love you. I'll always love you.\" Sometime later, after leaving Virginia, Aldo finds work as a mechanic with a dredge crew. Listening to his boss' tales of travel, Aldo begins planning a trip to Venezuela, but eventually loses interest. While walking along the river, Aldo sees Andreina (Lynn Shaw), a local prostitute living in a riverside shack. Andreina begins flirting with Aldo but he is now being sought by the police and has to rush off. Sometime later, Andreina finds the shack where Aldo is hiding and returns the coat he left. They go for walk along a wide expanse of rivershore  as desolate as their future. Aldo tells her about a time when a group of his friends wanted to go to a dance, and a woman named Irma asked him to go to a museum instead. Andreina gets annoyed at the pointless story, despite its importance to Aldo all these years later. He remembers his old refinery job and how, from the tower, he could see his house, the river, and his daughter coming back from school. Andreina remembers being pregnant once, and how it almost got her a man of her own, but the pregnancy \"went wrong\". In the coming days the rain falls heavy over the Po valley and the river rises. The roof on Andreina's shack leaks and neither of them have any food. Andreina goes to a nearby restaurant where she intends to sleep with the owner for food. Aldo follows and tries to get her to come back, but she refuses. Aldo leaves dejected. The next day Aldo decides to return to Goriano, getting a ride in the back of a truck that stops at Virginia's filling station. Virginia gives him the valise he left behind and tells him about a postcard that arrived with news from Irma, which  she says she has misplaced. Arriving in Goriano, Aldo finds the town in ferment over the construction of a military airfield which the inhabitants object to, and those at work leave their jobs to join the protest. Aldo spots Rosina entering Irma's house and through the window sees that she is content with a new baby and living a better life. As he turns to go, Irma notices him outside and follows him to the refinery which the workers have just quitted. Filled with despair, Aldo climbs to the top of the refinery tower where he once worked. From the ground Irma calls up to him, and he turns and sees her down below. Appearing weak and disoriented, Aldo falls to his death as Irma cries out in despair. She kneels over his dead body."

Weiler writes: In her review in The Village Voice, Leslie Camhi wrote that the film \"provides a missing link between Italian neorealism and the director's later work.\" Camhi praised Antonioni's skill at using landscape to reflect the inner emotions of the factory mechanic and his child who \"drift aimlessly through a nearly empty, semi-industrial landscape. The camera's spare, stunning compositions and the tone of loss and disaffection anticipate Antonioni's later, brilliant explorations of bourgeois anomie.\" In his review for the A.V. Club, Keith Phipps saw the film as an important transitional work between Antonioni's neo-realism roots and his later masterpieces. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 80% based on reviews from 10 critics."

According to the academic article Color, Character, and Culture: On \"Yellow Earth, Black Cannon Incident\", and \"Red Sorghum\" by H. C. Li, Yellow Earth begins with a scene depicting a communist soldier walking several miles. He reaches a small village where he is assigned to live with a poor as well as illiterate family with the task of recording local folk songs for use in the propagandized communist cause. The father in the family, an old widower, dislikes Gu's re-telling of social reforms about women receiving education and choosing who they will marry on their own terms within the communist domain in the province's south, but Cuiqiao, his hard-working daughter, happily listens to his tales and is joyful when her younger brother, Hanhan, becomes friends with Gu. Gu learns the hardships of peasant life and especially that of Cuiqiao. The story then focuses on the girl, who at only age 14, is told that she must marry a significantly older man in only a few months' time as her wedding dowry was used to pay for her mother's funeral and brother's engagement. She is even more miserable when Gu informs them that he must return to Yan'an. The next morning, Hanhan accompanies Gu as he leaves and they part ways. However, Cuiqiao is waiting for Gu along the way and she pleads to go along with him. Gu does not know of her forced marriage so he convinces her to go back as she cannot follow without his army's permission, but he will come back for her one day. The wedding day comes and Cuiqiao is taken away in a bridal sedan. On the other hand, Gu has reached Yan'an and is now watching a drum-dance for new recruits fighting for the anti-Japanese war. Cuiqiao informs Hanhan that she wants to run away to join the army and she tells him to take care of their father and give Gu some hand-sewn insoles whenever he comes back. At night, she tries to cross the turbulent Yellow River while singing a song taught by Gu Qing, but whether she makes it across remains unclear. Fast forward to another summer, Gu returns as he once promised Cuiqiao. But there is no one in the peasant family's home, so he goes into their village and sees countless peasants led by Cuiqiao's father praying and dancing for rain because the land has dried up and peoples' crops have died: \"Dragon King of the Sea, let the good rains fall. Send cool wind and gentle rain to save us all!\" Hanhan spots Gu and tries to go over to him, but a crowd of peasants obstructs his way. The film ends with the sound of Cuiqiao's song: \"The piebald cock flies over the wall. The Communist Party shall save us all!\" (96-97)"

After the two graduated in 1982, they went to work at the same film studio, Guangxi Film Studio. While working at the Guangxi Film Studio, Chen Kaige was the director and Zhang Yimou was the cameraman. The two collaborated on a film called Yellow Earth for artistic pursuits. It is also their only co-production. Yellow Earth is Chen Kaige's first film, who is an important figure in the Chinese fifth generation cinema history. Together with Zhang Yimou, who is also an icon in the fifth generation, they created a film that \"changed the face of filmmaking in the country\". The chemistry between Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou is well presented in this film because it is marked as a signature work that initiated the fifth generation Chinese cinema. Fifth generation directors create distinctive works because they add political allegories into their films that make them different from conventional and social-realist filmmaking. Unlike other state products, \"their films contain sophisticated reflections on the country's history, culture and its evolution\"."

Chen Kaige had said in an interview that he would not be able to make a film like Yellow Earth again. Specifically, he explains, the film is made when Chen Kaige can intimately get in contact with Shaanxi people's life in the particular time point. At the time the film was produced, new knowledge was rushing into the country, and women gained more freedom in the new society. Yet, the battle between the new and the old society is ongoing. The film portrays that people from the old time have already been accustomed to feudal ideologies. Even though they know there are new things coming out in the world, they think they are too poor to change anything. In other words, many people from the old feudal society in Shaanxi have already given up the search for hope and change. Change is luxurious and almost impossible to get under the poor and dry environment in Shaanxi. Cuiqiao is a transitional character between the old feudal society in Shaanxi and the new era of China."

The original novel, cited from an journal, \"reads more like a piece of\u00a0 adolescent fantasy, is about a unlikely but probable romance between Guqing and Cuiqiao, who committed suicide to defy an arranged marriage.\" However, in the cinematic remake of the novel, there is hardly any inkling of romantic aspiration. The author claims that \"Chen Kaige managed to de-sexualize Ke Lan's original text by casting Gu Qing in his thirties and Cuiqiao as a fourteen-year-old teenager\". Furthermore, Chen Kaige also gives a more positive ending to Cuiqiao, who has managed to defy her fate and escape from the constraints of feudalism."

The relationship between this aesthetic work and political discourse is critical because of the film's story background and its release year, where major historical events took place (wars and revolutions). According to scholar Esther Yau, author of \"Yellow Earth\": Western Analysis and a non-Western Text, the film ironically showcases the soldier's failure to bring about any changes, both in material and ideological levels, \"in the face of invincible feudalism and superstition among the masses transgresses socialist literacy standards\". It is thus reflected in this film as a criticism of the patriarchal and feudal ideologies of that Chinese culture. According to Yau, it is a fact that the censors were highly dissatisfied with the film's \"indulgence with poverty and backwardness\", which inserts negative and poor images to the country. Although no official banning takes place, it is still considered sensitive with respect to China's censorship. As a modernist critique of Chinese culture and history, Yellow Earth is a pioneering work made among other Chinese films during the same period, that inspires international intellectuals as well as other Chinese fifth generation filmmakers.\u00a0 According to Tian Zhuang Zhaung said in 1986,\"If it wasn't for Yellow Earth, then there wouldn't have been the whole debate about film aesthetics...[the film] represents the future of Chinese cinema now.\". It is also true that the addition of Daoist aesthetics added extra layers of meaning to the films that differentiate it from other Communist products during that period, according to scholar Mary Farquhar, author of The \"Hidden\" Gender in Yellow Earth. Another scholar, Stephanie Donald, author of Landscape and Agency Yellow Earth and the Demon Lover, points out that the shots of landscapes in the film play an important role. According to Donald, the landscape provides not just a backdrop for the drama of history, but also a process to rewrite or reinscribe history. He claims that the landscape has a specific meaning to reassert the meaning of China and its history across 50 years of revolutionary control. The depiction of the landscape, ethnic traditions and village lives reveals human conditions. In addition, as stated by Chen Kaige in an interview, Yellow Earth is a symbolic work that highlights the lives of peasants and hints at a \"voice of reform\"."

        "content": "Esther C. M. Yau from Film Quarterly described the film as being a \"significant instance of a non-western alternative in recent narrative film-making\". He compared the cinematography of the film to classical Chinese art, using a limited amount of colors, natural lighting, and a non-perspectival use of filmic space. He also expressed how the film was a radical departure from mainstream styles and narrative filmmaking in China. The film was proposed as an \"avant-gardist\" attempt by young Chinese filmmakers, from the Fifth Generation, taking inspiration from the abstractionist qualities of classical Chinese art. However, the initial reception of it in China was mixed. Although there was no full-scale ban of this film, the censor was dissatisfied with the film's \"indulgence with poverty and backwardness projecting a negative image of the country\". Critics also called the film being opaque and flat, in comparison to other melodramas in China at the time, particularly highlighting the scene when Cui Cao is forced to marry an old stranger. The film was also scrutinized for being ironic in its depiction of revolutionary ideals in comparison to the reality of how the soldiers failed to bring out any material or ideological changes within the story. Nevertheless, reception of this film outside China was mostly positive, where during its premiere at the 1985 Hong Kong International Festival, it was touted as \"an outstanding breakthrough\", \"expressing deep sentiments poured onto one's national roots\", and \"a bold exploration of film languages\". Richard James Havis, the author of Changing the Face of Chinese Cinema: An Interview with Chen Kaige, said that the film \"immediately brought attention to\" the \"Fifth Generation\" of Chinese filmmakers\". Havis said that the film \"proved a sensation\" at the Hong Kong International Festival. The positive reception of this film outside of China had changed attitudes towards even within China, prompting many locals to support this film through the box office."

        "content": "After blacking out from an all-night drinking binge, dock worker Bobo (Jean Gabin) wakes up in a decrepit shack on a San Pablo Bay barge. The barge's owner, fisherman Takeo (Victor Sen Yung), comes by to remind him how they met the previous night, and that he agreed to work for Takeo. Bobo does not remember the encounter and intends to leave. A police boat passes and, hearing that they are searching for the murderer of local bar-fly Pop Kelly (Arthur Aylesworth), who was strangled to death sometime during Bobo's drinking spree, causes Bobo to put the brakes on his plans to go. He is afraid he may have killed the man, due to drunken violence he has been capable of in the past. He takes the job on the barge, then goes into town to meet up with his friends, Tiny (Thomas Mitchell ) and Nutsy, the town watchman and amateur philosopher (Claude Rains) at a local boardinghouse. Despite Tiny's assurances that he didn't hurt anyone, Bobo worries. He agrees to meet Tiny later that night and leave town together. As he and Nutsy talk after Tiny leaves, Nutsy realizes Bobo is in possession of Pop Kelly's hat. As the two men walk near the water, a female group begins to shout about a young woman who is about to drown herself in the surf. Bobo rescues her and takes her back to the barge. Initially ungrateful and angry about being saved, she falls asleep in the bed and he takes the floor. The next morning, the young woman, Anna (Ida Lupino), has rebounded and tidies up the shack while Bobo repairs the boat of a wealthy doctor, Frank Brothers (Jerome Cowan) and his mistress (Helene Reynolds). Anna makes breakfast for Bobo. Tiny shows up and begins badmouthing Anna (\"she used to work in a hash house\") and implying she is a prostitute. He argues for he and Bobo to finally leave town as they agreed. Anna overhears and tells Bobo she is \"much obliged for everything\" but she is \"blowing now\", planning to go back to her life and make her way. Bobo appears to have fallen for Anna. After she is gone, Tiny hints broadly at what damage he might be able to do to Bobo, regarding his history of aggression. Bobo loses his temper and nearly strangles Tiny, but catches himself and tells him to get out and never come back. Nutsy stops by that night and finds Bobo having definitely decided to leave town alone. While they are chatting, Nutsy acting as a voice of reason and encouraging Bobo to accept that he may have reached a point where he wants a home, Anna returns. Unnoticed, Nutsy takes Pop Kelly's hat from the shack and later burns it on the beach. Anna and Bobo are obviously drawn to each other and she talks about her dream of settling down and creating a home, like the cozy barge across the bay. He grabs his bag and leaves, however, wishing her \"good luck\". In town he tries to spend time with Mildred (Robin Raymond), a prostitute he met during his drunken melee, but he can't stop thinking about Anna and goes back to the barge. Bobo and Anna decide to settle down and plan to get married. They buy paint and fabric to fix up the shack. After he heads out with Takeo to catch bait, Tiny once again interferes and suggests to Anna that he and \"his buddy\" have a dark history together. Anna is disturbed by this conversation and, when Bobo comes back she asks him about Tiny. He explains their relationship and tells her about his regrettable tendency to be violent, especially if he gets drunk. Bobo and Anna get married on the barge with all their friends in attendance. Dr. Brothers sails by during the wedding and asks Bobo to once again help him fix his boat. With Anna's blessing, Bobo agrees and they set off. His happily married state encourages the doctor to leave his mistress and return to his wife. On the barge, Anna opens a gift from Bobo\u2014a gaudy revealing dress, once owned by Mildred. Nutsy assures her that wives should leave modesty out of married life and Anna dons the dress, anticipating Bobo's return. After Nutsy leaves Anna, Tiny comes to the barge, drunk and angry that he wasn't invited to the wedding. Tiny and Anna argue and she realizes that Tiny killed Pop Kelly. Enraged, Tiny attacks Anna. When Bobo returns, he and the doctor find Anna stuffed in the bait box, badly injured. They rush her to the hospital and Dr. Brothers promises to do all he can for her. Leaving Nutsy to wait for word about his wife's condition, Bobo goes hunting for Tiny. He tracks a drunken Tiny to the breakwater near the barge. Bobo stalks him down to the water with Tiny professing his innocence the entire time. Tiny, who cannot swim, climbs onto the rocks to escape and is swept away by a wave. After some time has passed and Anna is able to leave the hospital, Bobo brings her back to the barge via the doctor's boat. She is unable to walk but he is anxious to at last carry her, as per tradition, across the threshold of their home, which has been spruced up to be as cozy as Anna dreamed it would be. Their favorite song plays as they go inside."

        "title": "Moontide_Production",
        "content": "Moontide was meant to be a star-making vehicle for Gabin, who was celebrated in his home country, but obscure in the United States. The charismatic Gabin had been in a number of successful leading-man roles and had a hand in picking Robertson's story for adaptation to film. Willing to take a chance on him, Twentieth Century Fox bought the rights, despite the novel's themes of prostitution, rape, cannibalism and murder. The Motion Picture Production Code meant the studio had to drop most of the story. In the role of the nefarious Tiny, Mitchell was cast against type, having played a more lovable version of himself as Scarlet O'Hara's father in Gone With The Wind. Soon after shooting began, director Fritz Lang left the project, rumored to be due to friction he had with Gabin regarding Marlene Dietrich, who had been involved with both men. It's not known which early footage is shot by Lang or replacement director Archie Mayo. There were problems regarding the film's location on San Pablo Bay, which had to be scrapped after the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the west coast was declared a security zone. A large studio set was filled with water for the barge scenes, giving the film an artificial, dream-like ambiance. The lighting, fog and wave effects, at times dingy and sinister or sparkling and romantic depending on the scene, led to Clarke's Oscar nomination for cinematography. Surrealist Salvador Dal\u00ed was hired to create the drunken montage at the top of the story but his sketches were deemed too bizarre, and the scene was shot with only some of his influence (most likely the close-up of the clock, the headless woman) intact.<ref name=MoontideDVD>Mayo, Archie (Director) (1942).

        "content": "Upon release, the film was not generally well-received by critics or audiences, deemed too odd a mix of genres and tones. Gabin was unhappy within the studio system and the pressure to do publicity, and after the war, he resumed working in France exclusively. Bosley Crowther, film critic for The New York Times, questioned the direction of the film, especially its focus on actor Jean Gabin: \"But all of them need much more than a vague and irresolute script, much more than synthetic scenery and manufactured moods. Director Archie Mayo hasn't brought them into contact with real life. He has expended most of his energy in bringing the audience into contact with Mr. Gabin. And Moontide is too heavy a burden to be carried entirely by him, even though he is Charles Boyer from the other side of the railroad tracks.\" In 2013, Dave Kehr (also of the Times) wrote, \"Moontide, ... provides an illuminating link to one of the frequently overlooked sources of noir: the movement known as 'poetic realism', which flourished in France from the mid-1930s until the onslaught of war ... a rootless, hard-drinking French sailor, Bobo (Gabin), achieves a tentative domesticity operating a bait shack with Anna (Ida Lupino), a waif he has rescued from a suicide attempt. The story is so much in the foggy, claustrophobic, doom-laden spirit of poetic realism that at times it seems almost a parody of it. Fate is present in the form of Tiny (Thomas Mitchell), a blackmailer with knowledge of a murder that Bobo might have committed. A kindlier metaphysical force is represented by Claude Rains, playing a waterfront philosopher with the unfortunate name Nutsy.\" When the DVD was released in 2008, critic David Mermelstein, writing for Variety'', wrote, \"A twisted romance set among waterfront lowlifes, the b&w pic resonated with neither critics nor auds, though as this DVD debut makes clear, there seems every reason to hope cineastes may now embrace it for what is always was: a keenly observed, highly atmospheric film distinguished by several superb performances and a captivating, if quotidian, mise-en-scene. Solid extras like a full commentary track and meaty 'making-of' featurette should only help raise its standing.\""

Graham has been a neglectful, absentee father who missed the entire trial while he was in a sanatorium in Canada. At first, Alec refuses to see Graham, and when they do meet, Alec is without any hope for reprieve and cannot show any affection for his father. His sobriety in constant jeopardy, Graham believes that his son is innocent and begins a frantic last-minute effort to find the evidence that will save his son's life, if not redeem himself as a father. With the help of his son's steadfast solicitor, Graham desperately, and often ineffectively, investigates the circumstances surrounding the girl's murder, visiting first her furious sister and then the home of wealthy car magnate Robert Stanford, where the girlfriend was killed. Stanford and his family have provided the only real support that Alec has ever known. Graham ricochets between potential allies, foes and new leads in order to learn who the real murderer could be, with suspects including Stanford's beautiful wife Honor, his even younger secretary Vickie Harker and his adopted son who's Alec's best friend, Brian, who allows Graham to see what his own misspent life looked like through his son's eyes. With the Home Office on standby to receive any evidence proving Alec's innocence, Graham is forced to extreme measures to try to establish the real killer's guilt. In a private room, Graham is permitted a final meeting with his son, with Honor there. Alec passionately kisses Honor, adding a new dimension. The conversation also alludes to Alec's relationship with Jenny. Honor leaves to allow father and son a final embrace, and more confessions are made. Graham visits a pub with Stanford and gathers some more clues before getting very drunk. Going to a theatre, he finds Stanford's alibi of spending the night with an actress was not actually true. He confronts Stanford at his race track where he is test-driving a Mercedes 300SL. Stanford explains that anyone can be bought and offers Graham shares in his company in exchange for silence. Still lacking evidence, he says that Stanford is threatening to kill him if he tells the truth. A struggle with a gun ensues and David deliberately has Stanford shoot him dead, saving Alec's life."

A fourth force\u2014a group of Manchurian bandits\u2014also want the map to sell to the Ghost Market. Tae-goo hopes to uncover the map's secrets and recover what he believes is gold and riches buried by the Qing Dynasty just before the collapse of their government. As the story continues, an escalating battle for the map occurs, with bounties placed on heads and the Imperial Japanese Army racing to reclaim its map as it can apparently \"save the Japanese Empire\". After a series of graphic shootouts and chases, a final battle erupts in which the Japanese army, Manchurian bandits, Do-won, Chang-yi and his gang are chasing Tae-goo all at once. The Japanese army kills most of the bandits. Do-won kills many Japanese soldiers and sets off an explosion that drives them away. Chang-yi's gang is slowly killed off and he kills those that attempt to leave the chase. Only Chang-yi, Tae-goo and Do-won make it to the \"treasure\". However, they find that it is nothing more than a boarded-over hole in the desert. Chang-yi recognizes Tae-goo as the \"Finger Chopper\"\u2014a criminal that cut off his finger in a knife fight five years ago\u2014and the man that Do-won had thought Chang-yi to be. Turning on each other in a final act of vengeance for the slights they suffered, they finally gun each other down after a prolonged Mexican standoff. The three lie in the sand, dying and alone, as the \"useless hole\" that they fought and died for suddenly and belatedly erupts with a geyser of crude oil. Do-won survives along with Tae-goo. With a newly raised bounty on Tae-goo, a new chase begins as he flees across the Manchurian desert."

        "content": "Two versions of the film were released in cinemas: one being for the native Korean market and the other for international sales. The Korean theatrical cut is 136 minutes long and the international cut is 129 minutes long. The Korean ending is more \"upbeat\" than the international version, including several more minutes of footage. In the alternative ending, The Weird, Tae-goo, gets up. He reveals the thick metal sheet he hid under his quilted jacket and limps over to demolish the corpse of Chang-yi, The Bad. While doing so, he discovers diamonds in Chang-yi's pocket and giggles with delight before realising he's surrounded by the Japanese army. Inadvertently lighting a stick of dynamite, Tae-goo scares off the Japanese and dives for cover after realising it was lit. Over the credits, Tae-goo sets off to continue hunting for the treasure with his bounty multiplied sevenfold, while The Good, Do-won, vindictively pursues him. The ending of the international version reflects the end that director Kim Jee-woon originally wanted. In the United Kingdom, the British Board of Film Classification ordered five seconds of cuts to the cinema release due to scenes of horse falls judged to be animal cruelty that violated the Cinematograph Films (Animals) Act 1937."

It also received screenings at the Toronto International Film Festival, Hawaii International Film Festival, Sitges Film Festival, Chicago International Film Festival, and the London Film Festival. American distribution rights were acquired by IFC Films, who released it in theaters on a limited basis on April 23, 2010. The Good, the Bad, the Weird received generally positive reviews. Review aggregating website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 84% of 60 sampled critics gave the film positive reviews and that it got a rating average of 7.2 out of 10 stating that \"Whilst never taking itself too seriously, this riotous and rollicking Sergio Leone-inspired Korean Western is serious fun.\" On Metacritic, it received generally favorable reviews with a total score of 69. Variety said that \"East meets West meets East again, with palate-tingling results, in 'The Good the Bad the Weird', a kimchi Western that draws shamelessly on its spaghetti forebears but remains utterly, bracingly Korean\" awarding the film 3.5 out of 5 stars.  The A.V. Club gave it a B+ saying that \"The story\u2019s many advances and reversals can be hard to follow at times, but this isn\u2019t really a movie where plot is paramount. Everything boils down to the action, and what that action means\". The New York Post gave it a four star rating out of five stating that \"The Good, the Bad, the Weird may owe a lot to other films but it is always fresh and never boring\". Empire magazine gave it a three star rating out of five commenting that \"A tangled narrative and damp -squib ending detract from an otherwise joyous Spaghetti Eastern Western.\" Time Out critic Tom Huddlestone stated that \"This is filmmaking as rodeo ride: bruising and ultimately pointless, but thrilling as hell while it lasts\" and awarded the film four out of five stars. The Hollywood Reporter gave it a positive review declaring the film \"a jaunty, happy-go-lucky adventure that packs a fistful of dynamite in the spectacular showdown.\" On the other hand, there were criticism directed towards the excessive violence and the simplicity of the script. In particular, the Village Voices Nicolas Rapold mentioned that \"Kim's filmmaking is generally cartoonish in a bad sense, as he squanders his set pieces, flashbacks, and other attention-getting with sometimes downright wretched staging\" while the Boston Globe wrote that the film \"goes for shallow pop instead of narrative depth. It's a lot of fun before it wears you out, and it wears you out sooner than it should.\" Additionally, Robert Abele from the Los Angeles Times mentioned that \"Knives, explosions and knockabout humor have been added to taste. As vigorously staged as it all is -- sometimes confusingly, occasionally with camera-torqueing flair and impressive stuntwork -- the urge to thrill grows wearisome. Were audience members to be included as a collective character as well, they'd be 'The Tired'.\""

The film was directed by Aristomenis Tsirbas who conceived it as a hard-edged live action feature with photo-real Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) environments. The close collaboration with producing partner and investor Snoot Entertainment redirected the project to become fully animated and appeal to younger audiences. The film features the voices of Evan Rachel Wood, Luke Wilson, Brian Cox and James Garner (In his last major film role before his death) among others. It premiered on September 8, 2007 at the Toronto International Film Festival. It was widely released in the United States on May 1, 2009. The film was originally shot in 2D but was made in such a way that a second camera could be added to the film. After the film was shown at festivals and distributors showed an interest in it, a small team was hired to render the entire film again from the perspective of the second camera for a true 3D effect. It won the Grand Prize for Best Animated Feature at the 2008 Ottawa International Animation Festival."

One day, a large, mysterious object partially blocks the Terrian sun, piquing the Terrians' interest. Mala, who is inventive and headstrong, goes against the rules of Terrian culture that ban the development of new technologies without the approval of the ruling council and creates a telescope, which she takes outside the city and uses to view the object. A lot of scout spaceships emerge from the large object, come down to the city and start abducting Terrians. Some willingly offer themselves to the spaceships mistaking them as their new \"gods\". After Mala's father, Roven (Dennis Quaid), is abducted, she lures a ship into a trap, causing it to crash. She saves the pilot, a human named Lieutenant James \"Jim\" Stanton (Luke Wilson). After his personal robot assistant, Giddy (David Cross), warns Mala that Jim will die without oxygen (which the Terrian atmosphere does not contain), she scavenges suitable plants and creates a tent in which Jim can breathe. In exchange, Giddy teaches her human language. Jim awakes and finds out his ship is damaged beyond repair. Giddy tells Mala why the humans have come: centuries beforehand, both Mars and Venus were terraformed and colonized by humans for their natural resources. 200 years later, the planets demanded independence from Earth, to no avail. This dispute escalated into a violent interplanetary war that rendered all three planets uninhabitable. The mysterious object in the sky is The Ark, a generation ship containing the remnants of the human race, traveling for several generations in search for a new home. They arrived at Terra, and gave it its name. Mala agrees to fix Jim's ship, so she can go with him to save Roven. When Mala, Jim, and Giddy return to the crash site, they discover the ship has been moved. The trio tracks the ship to a secret underground military facility where the elders and Doron (James Garner), the leader of the council, secretly retain the military technology from Terra's days of war. After infiltrating the facility, fixing the ship and flying back to the Ark. In it, the commander of the human army, General Hemmer (Brian Cox), takes over the Ark in a coup, and declares war on Terra. Mala finds Roven, but gets detected. A fight with the guards starts, in which she gets captured and Roven dies. Hemmer tells Jim his goal is to turn Terra into a new Earth. He will drop the Terraformer, a huge machine capable of creating an Earth-like atmosphere onto the planet's surface, annihilating the Terrians in the process. To test his loyalty, Hemmer creates a scenario in which Jim has to choose between killing Mala or his younger brother Stewart (Chris Evans). Jim seemingly saves Stewart, but also assists Mala in escaping back to Terra. He joins the space-fighters in charge of defending the Terraformer, while Hemmer personally supervises the mission within the machine. Doron and the Terrian elders allow Terrians to use the military technology from their base, beginning a huge battle. The humans drop the Terraformer onto the surface, and it begins replacing the native gases with oxygen and nitrogen, toxic to the alien inhabitants. As the machine is close to completing its objective, Jim realizes that annihilating the Terrians is morally wrong and fires his missiles at the command module, destroying it and killing a Hemmer in the process. The machine explodes. Mala, Giddy and Stewart barely survive, while Jim dies. Humans and aliens agree to live in peace, with the former deciding to live in an enclosure on the planet. A monument of Jim gets built, in memory of his heroic actions, much to Mala, Senn, Giddy and Stewart's comfort."

Awareness for the film on its opening weekend was subsequently little to non-existent. This strategy of having a disproportionately small advertising campaign for a wide release was employed only one other time a year earlier with the film Delgo. The results for that film were disastrous as the $40 million Delgo grossed a mere $694,782 on 2,160 screens. The lower costing Battle for Terra fared considerably better by taking in more than twice as much revenue ($1,647,083) on roughly half as many screens (1,159) and continued on to gross $6 million internationally.

        "title": "Virus_Summary",
        "content": "A virus is a submicroscopic infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of an organism. Viruses infect all life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea. Since Dmitri Ivanovsky's 1892 article describing a non-bacterial pathogen infecting tobacco plants and the discovery of the tobacco mosaic virus by Martinus Beijerinck in 1898, more than 9,000 virus species have been described in detail of the millions of types of viruses in the environment. Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the most numerous type of biological entity. The study of viruses is known as virology, a subspeciality of microbiology. When infected, a host cell is often forced to rapidly produce thousands of copies of the original virus. When not inside an infected cell or in the process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent particles, or virions, consisting of (i) the genetic material, i.e., long molecules of DNA or RNA that encode the structure of the proteins by which the virus acts; (ii) a protein coat, the capsid, which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an outside envelope of lipids. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple helical and icosahedral forms to more complex structures. Most virus species have virions too small to be seen with an optical microscope and are one-hundredth the size of most bacteria. The origins of viruses in the evolutionary history of life are unclear: some may have evolved from plasmids\u2014pieces of DNA that can move between cells\u2014while others may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses are an important means of horizontal gene transfer, which increases genetic diversity in a way analogous to sexual reproduction. Viruses are considered by some biologists to be a life form, because they carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through natural selection, although they lack the key characteristics, such as cell structure, that are generally considered necessary criteria for defining life. Because they possess some but not all such qualities, viruses have been described as \"organisms at the edge of life\", and as replicators. Viruses spread in many ways. One transmission pathway is through disease-bearing organisms known as vectors: for example, viruses are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on plant sap, such as aphids; and viruses in animals can be carried by blood-sucking insects. Many viruses, including influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2, chickenpox, smallpox, and measles, spread in the air by coughing and sneezing. Norovirus and rotavirus, common causes of viral gastroenteritis, are transmitted by the faecal\u2013oral route, passed by hand-to-mouth contact or in food or water. The infectious dose of norovirus required to produce infection in humans is less than 100 particles. HIV is one of several viruses transmitted through sexual contact and by exposure to infected blood. The variety of host cells that a virus can infect is called its \"host range\". This can be narrow, meaning a virus is capable of infecting few species, or broad, meaning it is capable of infecting many. Viral infections in animals provoke an immune response that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses can also be produced by vaccines, which confer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection. Some viruses, including those that cause HIV/AIDS, HPV infection, and viral hepatitis, evade these immune responses and result in chronic infections. Several classes of antiviral drugs have been developed."

Virulent, from Latin virulentus ('poisonous'), dates to c.\u00a01400. A meaning of 'agent that causes infectious disease' is first recorded in 1728, long before the discovery of viruses by Dmitri Ivanovsky in 1892. The English plural is viruses (sometimes also  vira),  whereas the Latin word is a mass noun, which has no classically attested plural (v\u012bra is used in Neo-Latin). The adjective viral dates to 1948. The term virion (plural virions), which dates from 1959, is also used to refer to a single viral particle that is released from the cell and is capable of infecting other cells of the same type."

        "content": "Louis Pasteur was unable to find a causative agent for rabies and speculated about a pathogen too small to be detected by microscopes. In 1884, the French microbiologist Charles Chamberland invented the Chamberland filter (or Pasteur-Chamberland filter) with pores small enough to remove all bacteria from a solution passed through it. In 1892, the Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this filter to study what is now known as the tobacco mosaic virus: crushed leaf extracts from infected tobacco plants remained infectious even after filtration to remove bacteria. Ivanovsky suggested the infection might be caused by a toxin produced by bacteria, but he did not pursue the idea. At the time it was thought that all infectious agents could be retained by filters and grown on a nutrient medium\u2014this was part of the germ theory of disease. In 1898, the Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck repeated the experiments and became convinced that the filtered solution contained a new form of infectious agent. He observed that the agent multiplied only in cells that were dividing, but as his experiments did not show that it was made of particles, he called it a contagium vivum fluidum (soluble living germ) and reintroduced the word virus. Beijerinck maintained that viruses were liquid in nature, a theory later discredited by Wendell Stanley, who proved they were particulate. In the same year, Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch passed the first animal virus, aphthovirus (the agent of foot-and-mouth disease), through a similar filter. In the early 20th century, the English bacteriologist Frederick Twort discovered a group of viruses that infect bacteria, now called bacteriophages (or commonly 'phages'), and the French-Canadian microbiologist F\u00e9lix d'Herelle described viruses that, when added to bacteria on an agar plate, would produce areas of dead bacteria. He accurately diluted a suspension of these viruses and discovered that the highest dilutions (lowest virus concentrations), rather than killing all the bacteria, formed discrete areas of dead organisms. Counting these areas and multiplying by the dilution factor allowed him to calculate the number of viruses in the original suspension. Phages were heralded as a potential treatment for diseases such as typhoid and cholera, but their promise was forgotten with the development of penicillin. The development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics has renewed interest in the therapeutic use of bacteriophages. By the end of the 19th century, viruses were defined in terms of their infectivity, their ability to pass filters, and their requirement for living hosts. Viruses had been grown only in plants and animals. In 1906 Ross Granville Harrison invented a method for growing tissue in lymph, and in 1913 E.\u00a0Steinhardt, C.\u00a0Israeli, and R.A. Lambert used this method to grow vaccinia virus in fragments of guinea pig corneal tissue. In 1928, H. B. Maitland and M. C. Maitland grew vaccinia virus in suspensions of minced hens' kidneys. Their method was not widely adopted until the 1950s when poliovirus was grown on a large scale for vaccine production. Another breakthrough came in 1931 when the American pathologist Ernest William Goodpasture and Alice Miles Woodruff grew influenza and several other viruses in fertilised chicken eggs. In 1949, John Franklin Enders, Thomas Weller, and Frederick Robbins grew poliovirus in cultured cells from aborted human embryonic tissue, the first virus to be grown without using solid animal tissue or eggs. This work enabled Hilary Koprowski, and then Jonas Salk, to make an effective polio vaccine. The first images of viruses were obtained upon the invention of electron microscopy in 1931 by the German engineers Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll. In 1935, American biochemist and virologist Wendell Meredith Stanley examined the tobacco mosaic virus and found it was mostly made of protein. A short time later, this virus was separated into protein and RNA parts. The tobacco mosaic virus was the first to be crystallised and its structure could, therefore, be elucidated in detail. The first X-ray diffraction pictures of the crystallised virus were obtained by Bernal and Fankuchen in 1941. Based on her X-ray crystallographic pictures, Rosalind Franklin discovered the full structure of the virus in 1955. In the same year, Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat and Robley Williams showed that purified tobacco mosaic virus RNA and its protein coat can assemble by themselves to form functional viruses, suggesting that this simple mechanism was probably the means through which viruses were created within their host cells. The second half of the 20th century was the golden age of virus discovery, and most of the documented species of animal, plant, and bacterial viruses were discovered during these years. In 1957 equine arterivirus and the cause of Bovine virus diarrhoea (a pestivirus) were discovered. In 1963 the hepatitis B virus was discovered by Baruch Blumberg, and in 1965 Howard Temin described the first retrovirus. Reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that retroviruses use to make DNA copies of their RNA, was first described in 1970 by Temin and David Baltimore independently. In 1983 Luc Montagnier's team at the Pasteur Institute in France, first isolated the retrovirus now called HIV. In 1989 Michael Houghton's team at Chiron Corporation discovered hepatitis C."

        "content": "Viruses are found wherever there is life and have probably existed since living cells first evolved. The origin of viruses is unclear because they do not form fossils, so molecular techniques are used to investigate how they arose. In addition, viral genetic material occasionally integrates into the germline of the host organisms, by which they can be passed on vertically to the offspring of the host for many generations. This provides an invaluable source of information for paleovirologists to trace back ancient viruses that have existed up to millions of years ago. There are three main hypotheses that aim to explain the origins of viruses: Regressive hypothesis  Viruses may have once been small cells that parasitised larger cells. Over time, genes not required by their parasitism were lost. The bacteria rickettsia and chlamydia are living cells that, like viruses, can reproduce only inside host cells. They lend support to this hypothesis, as their dependence on parasitism is likely to have caused the loss of genes that enabled them to survive outside a cell. This is also called the 'degeneracy hypothesis', or 'reduction hypothesis'. Cellular origin hypothesis  Some viruses may have evolved from bits of DNA or RNA that \"escaped\" from the genes of a larger organism. The escaped DNA could have come from plasmids (pieces of naked DNA that can move between cells) or transposons (molecules of DNA that replicate and move around to different positions within the genes of the cell). Once called \"jumping genes\", transposons are examples of mobile genetic elements and could be the origin of some viruses. They were discovered in maize by Barbara McClintock in 1950. This is sometimes called the 'vagrancy hypothesis', or the 'escape hypothesis'. Co-evolution hypothesis This is also called the 'virus-first hypothesis' and proposes that viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and nucleic acid at the same time that cells first appeared on Earth and would have been dependent on cellular life for billions of years. Viroids are molecules of RNA that are not classified as viruses because they lack a protein coat. They have characteristics that are common to several viruses and are often called subviral agents. Viroids are important pathogens of plants. They do not code for proteins but interact with the host cell and use the host machinery for their replication. The hepatitis delta virus of humans has an RNA genome similar to viroids but has a protein coat derived from hepatitis B virus and cannot produce one of its own. It is, therefore, a defective virus. Although hepatitis delta virus genome may replicate independently once inside a host cell, it requires the help of hepatitis B virus to provide a protein coat so that it can be transmitted to new cells. In similar manner, the sputnik virophage is dependent on mimivirus, which infects the protozoan Acanthamoeba castellanii. These viruses, which are dependent on the presence of other virus species in the host cell, are called 'satellites' and may represent evolutionary intermediates of viroids and viruses. In the past, there were problems with all of these hypotheses: the regressive hypothesis did not explain why even the smallest of cellular parasites do not resemble viruses in any way. The escape hypothesis did not explain the complex capsids and other structures on virus particles. The virus-first hypothesis contravened the definition of viruses in that they require host cells. Viruses are now recognised as ancient and as having origins that pre-date the divergence of life into the three domains. This discovery has led modern virologists to reconsider and re-evaluate these three classical hypotheses. The evidence for an ancestral world of RNA cells and computer analysis of viral and host DNA sequences are giving a better understanding of the evolutionary relationships between different viruses and may help identify the ancestors of modern viruses. To date, such analyses have not proved which of these hypotheses is correct. It seems unlikely that all currently known viruses have a common ancestor, and viruses have probably arisen numerous times in the past by one or more mechanisms."

        "content": "Scientific opinions differ on whether viruses are a form of life or organic structures that interact with living organisms. They have been described as \"organisms at the edge of life\", since they resemble organisms in that they possess genes, evolve by natural selection, and reproduce by creating multiple copies of themselves through self-assembly. Although they have genes, they do not have a cellular structure, which is often seen as the basic unit of life. Viruses do not have their own metabolism and require a host cell to make new products. They therefore cannot naturally reproduce outside a host cell\u2014although some bacteria such as rickettsia and chlamydia are considered living organisms despite the same limitation. Accepted forms of life use cell division to reproduce, whereas viruses spontaneously assemble within cells. They differ from autonomous growth of crystals as they inherit genetic mutations while being subject to natural selection. Virus self-assembly within host cells has implications for the study of the origin of life, as it lends further credence to the hypothesis that life could have started as self-assembling organic molecules."

        "content": "Viruses display a wide diversity of sizes and shapes, called 'morphologies'. In general, viruses are much smaller than bacteria and more than a thousand bacteriophage viruses would fit inside an Escherichia coli bacterium's cell. Many viruses that have been studied are spherical and have a diameter between 20 and 300 nanometres. Some filoviruses, which are filaments have a total length of up to 1400\u00a0nm; their diameters are only about 80\u00a0nm. Most viruses cannot be seen with an optical microscope, so scanning and transmission electron microscopes are used to visualise them. To increase the contrast between viruses and the background, electron-dense \"stains\" are used. These are solutions of salts of heavy metals, such as tungsten, that scatter the electrons from regions covered with the stain. When virions are coated with stain (positive staining), fine detail is obscured. Negative staining overcomes this problem by staining the background only. A complete virus particle, known as a virion, consists of nucleic acid surrounded by a protective coat of protein called a capsid. These are formed from  protein subunits called capsomeres. Viruses can have a lipid \"envelope\" derived from the host cell membrane. The capsid is made from proteins encoded by the viral genome and its shape serves as the basis for morphological distinction. Virally-coded protein subunits will self-assemble to form a capsid, in general requiring the presence of the virus genome. Complex viruses code for proteins that assist in the construction of their capsid. Proteins associated with nucleic acid are known as nucleoproteins, and the association of viral capsid proteins with viral nucleic acid is called a nucleocapsid. The capsid and entire virus structure can be mechanically (physically) probed through atomic force microscopy. In general, there are five main morphological virus types: Helical These viruses are composed of a single type of capsomere stacked around a central axis to form a helical structure, which may have a central cavity, or tube. This arrangement results in virions which can be short and highly rigid rods, or long and very flexible filaments. The genetic material (typically single-stranded RNA, but single-stranded DNA in some cases) is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, the length of a helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it, and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus and inovirus  are examples of helical viruses. Icosahedral Most animal viruses are icosahedral or near-spherical with chiral icosahedral symmetry. A regular icosahedron is the optimum way of forming a closed shell from identical subunits. The minimum number of capsomeres required for each triangular face is 3, which gives 60 for the icosahedron. Many viruses, such as rotavirus, have more than 60 capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry. To achieve this, the capsomeres at the apices are surrounded by five other capsomeres and are called pentons. Capsomeres on the triangular faces are surrounded by six others and are called hexons. Hexons are in essence flat and pentons, which form the 12 vertices, are curved. The same protein may act as the subunit of both the pentamers and hexamers or they may be composed of different proteins. Prolate This is an icosahedron elongated along the fivefold axis and is a common arrangement of the heads of bacteriophages. This structure is composed of a cylinder with a cap at either end. EnvelopedSome species of virus envelop themselves in a modified form of one of the cell membranes, either the outer membrane surrounding an infected host cell or internal membranes such as a nuclear membrane or endoplasmic reticulum, thus gaining an outer lipid bilayer known as a viral envelope. This membrane is studded with proteins coded for by the viral genome and host genome; the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present originate entirely from the host. Influenza virus, HIV (which causes AIDS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (which causes COVID-19) use this strategy. Most enveloped viruses are dependent on the envelope for their infectivity. Complex These viruses possess a capsid that is neither purely helical nor purely icosahedral, and that may possess extra structures such as protein tails or a complex outer wall. Some bacteriophages, such as Enterobacteria phage T4, have a complex structure consisting of an icosahedral head bound to a helical tail, which may have a hexagonal base plate with protruding protein tail fibres. This tail structure acts like a molecular syringe, attaching to the bacterial host and then injecting the viral genome into the cell. The poxviruses are large, complex viruses that have an unusual morphology. The viral genome is associated with proteins within a central disc structure known as a nucleoid. The nucleoid is surrounded by a membrane and two lateral bodies of unknown function. The virus has an outer envelope with a thick layer of protein studded over its surface. The whole virion is slightly pleomorphic, ranging from ovoid to brick-shaped."

The capsid appears hexagonal under an electron microscope, therefore the capsid is probably icosahedral. In 2011, researchers discovered the largest then known virus in samples of water collected from the ocean floor off the coast of Las Cruces, Chile. Provisionally named Megavirus chilensis, it can be seen with a basic optical microscope. In 2013, the Pandoravirus genus was discovered in Chile and Australia, and has genomes about twice as large as Megavirus and Mimivirus. All giant viruses have dsDNA genomes and they are classified into several families: Mimiviridae, Pithoviridae, Pandoraviridae, Phycodnaviridae, and the Mollivirus genus. Some viruses that infect Archaea have complex structures unrelated to any other form of virus, with a wide variety of unusual shapes, ranging from spindle-shaped structures to viruses that resemble hooked rods, teardrops or even bottles.

        "content": "An enormous variety of genomic structures can be seen among viral species; as a group, they contain more structural genomic diversity than plants, animals, archaea, or bacteria. There are millions of different types of viruses, although fewer than 7,000 types have been described in detail. As of January 2021, the NCBI Virus genome database has more than 193,000 complete genome sequences, but there are doubtlessly many more to be discovered. A virus has either a DNA or an RNA genome and is called a DNA virus or an RNA virus, respectively. The vast majority of viruses have RNA genomes. Plant viruses tend to have single-stranded RNA genomes and bacteriophages tend to have double-stranded DNA genomes. Viral genomes are circular, as in the polyomaviruses, or linear, as in the adenoviruses. The type of nucleic acid is irrelevant to the shape of the genome. Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided up into separate parts, in which case it is called segmented. For RNA viruses, each segment often codes for only one protein and they are usually found together in one capsid. All segments are not required to be in the same virion for the virus to be infectious, as demonstrated by brome mosaic virus and several other plant viruses. A viral genome, irrespective of nucleic acid type, is almost always either single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds). Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, analogous to a ladder. The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the Hepadnaviridae, contain a genome that is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded. For most viruses with RNA genomes and some with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genomes, the single strands are said to be either positive-sense (called the 'plus-strand') or negative-sense (called the 'minus-strand'), depending on if they are complementary to the viral messenger RNA (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately translated by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that positive-strand viral ssDNA is identical in sequence to the viral mRNA and is thus a coding strand, while negative-sense viral ssDNA is complementary to the viral mRNA and is thus a template strand. Several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are ambisense in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate. Examples include geminiviruses, which are ssDNA plant viruses and arenaviruses, which are ssRNA viruses of animals."

Virus genes rarely have introns and often are arranged in the genome so that they overlap. In general, RNA viruses have smaller genome sizes than DNA viruses because of a higher error-rate when replicating, and have a maximum upper size limit. Beyond this, errors when replicating render the virus useless or uncompetitive. To compensate, RNA viruses often have segmented genomes\u2014the genome is split into smaller molecules\u2014thus reducing the chance that an error in a single-component genome will incapacitate the entire genome. In contrast, DNA viruses generally have larger genomes because of the high fidelity of their replication enzymes.

Most of these point mutations are \"silent\"\u2014they do not change the protein that the gene encodes\u2014but others can confer evolutionary advantages such as resistance to antiviral drugs. Antigenic shift occurs when there is a major change in the genome of the virus. This can be a result of recombination or reassortment. When this happens with influenza viruses, pandemics might result. RNA viruses often exist as quasispecies or swarms of viruses of the same species but with slightly different genome nucleoside sequences. Such quasispecies are a prime target for natural selection. Segmented genomes confer evolutionary advantages; different strains of a virus with a segmented genome can shuffle and combine genes and produce progeny viruses (or offspring) that have unique characteristics. This is called reassortment or 'viral sex'. Genetic recombination is the process by which a strand of DNA (or RNA) is broken and then joined to the end of a different DNA (or RNA)  molecule. This can occur when viruses infect cells simultaneously and studies of viral evolution have shown that recombination has been rampant in the species studied. Recombination is common to both RNA and DNA viruses."

        "content": "Viral populations do not grow through cell division, because they are acellular. Instead, they use the machinery and metabolism of a host cell to produce multiple copies of themselves, and they assemble in the cell. When infected, the host cell is forced to rapidly produce thousands of  copies of the original virus. Their life cycle differs greatly between species, but there are six basic stages in their life cycle: Attachment is a specific binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface. This specificity determines the host range and type of host cell of a virus. For example, HIV infects a limited range of human leucocytes. This is because its surface protein, gp120, specifically interacts with the CD4 molecule\u2014a chemokine receptor\u2014which is most commonly found on the surface of CD4+ T-Cells. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication. Attachment to the receptor can induce the viral envelope protein to undergo changes that result in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, or changes of non-enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the virus to enter. Penetration or viral entry follows attachment: Virions enter the host cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis or membrane fusion. The infection of plant and fungal cells is different from that of animal cells. Plants have a rigid cell wall made of cellulose, and fungi one of chitin, so most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma to the cell wall. Nearly all plant viruses (such as tobacco mosaic virus) can also move directly from cell to cell, in the form of single-stranded nucleoprotein complexes, through pores called plasmodesmata. Bacteria, like plants, have strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell. Given that bacterial cell walls are much thinner than plant cell walls due to their much smaller size, some viruses have evolved mechanisms that inject their genome into the bacterial cell across the cell wall, while the viral capsid remains outside. Uncoating is a process in which the viral capsid is removed: This may be by degradation by viral enzymes or host enzymes or by simple dissociation; the end-result is the releasing of the viral genomic nucleic acid. Replication of viruses involves primarily multiplication of the genome. Replication involves the synthesis of viral messenger RNA (mRNA) from \"early\" genes (with exceptions for positive-sense RNA viruses), viral protein synthesis, possible assembly of viral proteins, then viral genome replication mediated by early or regulatory protein expression. This may be followed, for complex viruses with larger genomes, by one or more further rounds of mRNA synthesis: \"late\" gene expression is, in general, of structural or virion proteins. Assembly \u2013 Following the structure-mediated self-assembly of the virus particles, some modification of the proteins often occurs. In viruses such as HIV, this modification (sometimes called maturation) occurs after the virus has been released from the host cell. Release \u2013 Viruses can be released from the host cell by lysis, a process that kills the cell by bursting its membrane and cell wall if present: this is a feature of many bacterial and some animal viruses. Some viruses undergo a lysogenic cycle where the viral genome is incorporated by genetic recombination into a specific place in the host's chromosome. The viral genome is then known as a \"provirus\" or, in the case of bacteriophages a \"prophage\". Whenever the host divides, the viral genome is also replicated. The viral genome is mostly silent within the host. At some point, the provirus or prophage may give rise to the active virus, which may lyse the host cells. Enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV) typically are released from the host cell by budding. During this process, the virus acquires its envelope, which is a modified piece of the host's plasma or other, internal membrane."

        "content": "The genetic material within virus particles, and the method by which the material is replicated, varies considerably between different types of viruses. DNA viruses The genome replication of most DNA viruses takes place in the cell's nucleus. If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter the cell either by direct fusion with the cell membrane (e.g., herpesviruses) or\u2014more usually\u2014by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery and RNA processing machinery. Viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves. In eukaryotes, the viral genome must cross the cell's nuclear membrane to access this machinery, while in bacteria it need only enter the cell. RNA viruses Replication of RNA viruses usually takes place in the cytoplasm. RNA viruses can be placed into four different groups depending on their modes of replication. The polarity (whether or not it can be used directly by ribosomes to make proteins) of single-stranded RNA viruses largely determines the replicative mechanism; the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is single-stranded or double-stranded. All RNA viruses use their own RNA replicase enzymes to create copies of their genomes. Reverse transcribing viruses Reverse transcribing viruses have ssRNA (Retroviridae, Metaviridae, Pseudoviridae) or dsDNA (Caulimoviridae, and Hepadnaviridae) in their particles. Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes (retroviruses) use a DNA intermediate to replicate, whereas those with DNA genomes (pararetroviruses) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use a reverse transcriptase, or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme, to carry out the nucleic acid conversion. Retroviruses integrate the DNA produced by reverse transcription into the host genome as a provirus as a part of the replication process; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus. They are susceptible to antiviral drugs that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, e.g. zidovudine and lamivudine. An example of the first type is HIV, which is a retrovirus. Examples of the second type are the Hepadnaviridae, which includes Hepatitis B virus."

This system based classification on phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. Viruses were grouped according to their shared properties (not those of their hosts) and the type of nucleic acid forming their genomes. In 1966, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) was formed. The system proposed by Lwoff, Horne and Tournier was initially not accepted by the ICTV because the small genome size of viruses and their high rate of mutation made it difficult to determine their ancestry beyond order. As such, the Baltimore classification system has come to be used to supplement the more traditional hierarchy. Starting in 2018, the ICTV began to acknowledge deeper evolutionary relationships between viruses that have been discovered over time and adopted a 15-rank classification system ranging from realm to species."

Many serious diseases such as rabies, Ebola virus disease, AIDS (HIV), avian influenza, and SARS are caused by viruses. The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is described in terms of virulence. Other diseases are under investigation to discover if they have a virus as the causative agent, such as the possible connection between human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) and neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome. There is controversy over whether the bornavirus, previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans. Viruses have different mechanisms by which they produce disease in an organism, which depends largely on the viral species. Mechanisms at the cellular level primarily include cell lysis, the breaking open and subsequent death of the cell. In multicellular organisms, if enough cells die, the whole organism will start to suffer the effects. Although viruses cause disruption of healthy homeostasis, resulting in disease, they may exist relatively harmlessly within an organism. An example would include the ability of the herpes simplex virus, which causes cold sores, to remain in a dormant state within the human body. This is called latency and is a characteristic of the herpes viruses, including Epstein\u2013Barr virus, which causes glandular fever, and varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shingles. Most people have been infected with at least one of these types of herpes virus. These latent viruses might sometimes be beneficial, as the presence of the virus can increase immunity against bacterial pathogens, such as Yersinia pestis. Some viruses can cause lifelong or chronic infections, where the viruses continue to replicate in the body despite the host's defence mechanisms. This is common in hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infections. People chronically infected are known as carriers, as they serve as reservoirs of infectious virus. In populations with a high proportion of carriers, the disease is said to be endemic."

        "content": "Viral epidemiology is the branch of medical science that deals with the transmission and control of virus infections in humans. Transmission of viruses can be vertical, which means from mother to child, or horizontal, which means from person to person. Examples of vertical transmission include hepatitis B virus and HIV, where the baby is born already infected with the virus. Another, more rare, example is the varicella zoster virus, which, although causing relatively mild infections in children and adults, can be fatal to the foetus and newborn baby. Horizontal transmission is the most common mechanism of spread of viruses in populations. Horizontal transmission can occur when body fluids are exchanged during sexual activity, by exchange of saliva or when contaminated food or water is ingested. It can also occur when aerosols containing viruses are inhaled or by insect vectors such as when infected mosquitoes penetrate the skin of a host. Most types of viruses are restricted to just one or two of these mechanisms and they are referred to as \"respiratory viruses\" or \"enteric viruses\" and so forth. The rate or speed of transmission of viral infections depends on factors that include population density, the number of susceptible individuals, (i.e., those not immune), the quality of healthcare and the weather. Epidemiology is used to break the chain of infection in populations during outbreaks of viral diseases. Control measures are used that are based on knowledge of how the virus is transmitted. It is important to find the source, or sources, of the outbreak and to identify the virus. Once the virus has been identified, the chain of transmission can sometimes be broken by vaccines. When vaccines are not available, sanitation and disinfection can be effective. Often, infected people are isolated from the rest of the community, and those that have been exposed to the virus are placed in quarantine. To control the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle in Britain in 2001, thousands of cattle were slaughtered. Most viral infections of humans and other animals have incubation periods during which the infection causes no signs or symptoms. Incubation periods for viral diseases range from a few days to weeks, but are known for most infections. Somewhat overlapping, but mainly following the incubation period, there is a period of communicability\u2014a time when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another person or animal. This, too, is known for many viral infections, and knowledge of the length of both periods is important in the control of outbreaks. When outbreaks cause an unusually high proportion of cases in a population, community, or region, they are called epidemics. If outbreaks spread worldwide, they are called pandemics."

The victims were often healthy young adults, in contrast to most influenza outbreaks, which predominantly affect juvenile, elderly, or otherwise-weakened patients. Older estimates say it killed 40\u201350\u00a0million people, while more recent research suggests that it may have killed as many as 100\u00a0million people, or 5% of the world's population in 1918. Although viral pandemics are rare events, HIV\u2014which evolved from viruses found in monkeys and chimpanzees\u2014has been pandemic since at least the 1980s. During the 20th century there were four pandemics caused by influenza virus and those that occurred in 1918, 1957 and 1968 were severe. Most researchers believe that HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century; it is now a pandemic, with an estimated 37.9\u00a0million people now living with the disease worldwide. There were about 770,000 deaths from AIDS in 2018. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) estimate that AIDS has killed more than 25\u00a0million people since it was first recognised on 5 June 1981, making it one of the most destructive epidemics in recorded history. In 2007 there were 2.7\u00a0million new HIV infections and 2\u00a0million HIV-related deaths. Several highly lethal viral pathogens are members of the Filoviridae. Filoviruses are filament-like viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fever, and include ebolaviruses and marburgviruses. Marburg virus, first discovered in 1967, attracted widespread press attention in April 2005 for an outbreak in Angola. Ebola virus disease has also caused intermittent outbreaks with high mortality rates since 1976 when it was first identified. The worst and most recent one is the 2013\u20132016 West Africa epidemic. Except for smallpox, most pandemics are caused by newly evolved viruses. These \"emergent\" viruses are usually mutants of less harmful viruses that have circulated previously either in humans or other animals. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)  are caused by new types of coronaviruses. Other coronaviruses are known to cause mild infections in humans, so the virulence and rapid spread of SARS infections\u2014that by July 2003 had caused around 8,000 cases and 800 deaths\u2014was unexpected and most countries were not prepared. A related coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), thought to have originated in bats, emerged in Wuhan, China in November 2019 and spread rapidly around the world.  Infections with the virus caused the COVID-19 pandemic that started in 2020. Unprecedented restrictions in peacetime were been placed on international travel, and curfews were imposed in several major cities worldwide in response to the pandemic."

RNA interference is an important innate defence against viruses. Many viruses have a replication strategy that involves double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). When such a virus infects a cell, it releases its RNA molecule or molecules, which immediately bind to a protein complex called a dicer that cuts the RNA into smaller pieces. A biochemical pathway\u2014the RISC complex\u2014is activated, which ensures cell survival by degrading the viral mRNA. Rotaviruses have evolved to avoid this defence mechanism by not uncoating fully inside the cell, and releasing newly produced mRNA through pores in the particle's inner capsid. Their genomic dsRNA remains protected inside the core of the virion. When the adaptive immune system of a vertebrate encounters a virus, it produces specific antibodies that bind to the virus and often render it non-infectious. This is called humoral immunity. Two types of antibodies are important. The first, called IgM, is highly effective at neutralising viruses but is produced by the cells of the immune system only for a few weeks. The second, called IgG, is produced indefinitely. The presence of IgM in the blood of the host is used to test for acute infection, whereas IgG indicates an infection sometime in the past. IgG antibody is measured when tests for immunity are carried out. Antibodies can continue to be an effective defence mechanism even after viruses have managed to gain entry to the host cell. A protein that is in cells, called TRIM21, can attach to the antibodies on the surface of the virus particle. This primes the subsequent destruction of the virus by the enzymes of the cell's proteosome system. A second defence of vertebrates against viruses is called cell-mediated immunity and involves immune cells known as T cells. The body's cells constantly display short fragments of their proteins on the cell's surface, and, if a T cell recognises a suspicious viral fragment there, the host cell is destroyed by 'killer T' cells and the virus-specific T-cells proliferate. Cells such as the macrophage are specialists at this antigen presentation. The production of interferon is an important host defence mechanism. This is a hormone produced by the body when viruses are present. Its role in immunity is complex; it eventually stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the infected cell and its close neighbours. Not all virus infections produce a protective immune response in this way. HIV evades the immune system by constantly changing the amino acid sequence of the proteins on the surface of the virion. This is known as \"escape mutation\" as the viral epitopes escape recognition by the host immune response. These persistent viruses evade immune control by sequestration, blockade of antigen presentation, cytokine resistance, evasion of natural killer cell activities, escape from apoptosis, and antigenic shift. Other viruses, called 'neurotropic viruses', are disseminated by neural spread where the immune system may be unable to reach them due to immune privilege."

Smallpox infections have been eradicated. Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans, and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals. Vaccines can consist of live-attenuated or killed viruses, viral proteins (antigens), or RNA. Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus, which do not cause the disease but, nonetheless, confer immunity. Such viruses are called attenuated. Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity (who are described as immunocompromised), because in these people, the weakened virus can cause the original disease. Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines. These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus. Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine. Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they cannot cause the disease. The yellow fever virus vaccine, a live-attenuated strain called 17D, is probably the safest and most effective vaccine ever generated."

        "content": "Antiviral drugs are often nucleoside analogues (fake DNA building-blocks), which viruses mistakenly incorporate into their genomes during replication. The life-cycle of the virus is then halted because the newly synthesised DNA is inactive. This is because these analogues lack the hydroxyl groups, which, along with phosphorus atoms, link together to form the strong \"backbone\" of the DNA molecule. This is called DNA chain termination. Examples of nucleoside analogues are aciclovir for Herpes simplex virus infections and lamivudine for HIV and hepatitis B virus infections. Aciclovir is one of the oldest and most frequently prescribed antiviral drugs. Other antiviral drugs in use target different stages of the viral life cycle. HIV is dependent on a proteolytic enzyme called the HIV-1 protease for it to become fully infectious. There is a large class of drugs called protease inhibitors that inactivate this enzyme. There are around thirteen classes of antiviral drugs each targeting different viruses or stages of viral replication. Hepatitis C is caused by an RNA virus. In 80% of people infected, the disease is chronic, and without treatment, they are infected for the remainder of their lives. There are effective treatments that use direct-acting antivirals. The treatment of chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus by using  similar strategies that include lamivudine and other anti-viral drugs have been developed."

Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by organisms, known as vectors. These are usually insects, but some fungi, nematode worms, single-celled organisms, and parasitic plants are vectors. When control of plant virus infections is considered economical, for perennial fruits, for example, efforts are concentrated on killing the vectors and removing alternate hosts such as weeds. Plant viruses cannot infect humans and other animals because they can reproduce only in living plant cells. Originally from Peru, the potato has become a staple crop worldwide. The potato virus Y causes disease in potatoes and related species including tomatoes and peppers. In the 1980s, this virus acquired economical importance when it proved difficult to control in seed potato crops. Transmitted by aphids, this virus can reduce crop yields by up to 80 per cent, causing significant losses to potato yields. Plants have elaborate and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One of the most effective is the presence of so-called resistance (R) genes. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading. RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants. When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants that kill viruses, such as salicylic acid, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen molecules. Plant virus particles or virus-like particles (VLPs) have applications in both biotechnology and nanotechnology. The capsids of most plant viruses are simple and robust structures and can be produced in large quantities either by the infection of plants or by expression in a variety of heterologous systems. Plant virus particles can be modified genetically and chemically to encapsulate foreign material and can be incorporated into supramolecular structures for use in biotechnology."

These viruses infect specific bacteria by binding to surface receptor molecules and then entering the cell. Within a short amount of time, in some cases, just minutes, bacterial polymerase starts translating viral mRNA into protein. These proteins go on to become either new virions within the cell, helper proteins, which help assembly of new virions, or proteins involved in cell lysis. Viral enzymes aid in the breakdown of the cell membrane, and, in the case of the T4 phage, in just over twenty minutes after injection over three hundred phages could be released. The major way bacteria defend themselves from bacteriophages is by producing enzymes that destroy foreign DNA. These enzymes, called restriction endonucleases, cut up the viral DNA that bacteriophages inject into bacterial cells. Bacteria also contain a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of viruses that the bacteria have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block the virus's replication through a form of RNA interference. This genetic system provides bacteria with acquired immunity to infection."

Bacteriophages are harmless to plants and animals, and are essential to the regulation of marine and freshwater ecosystems  are important mortality agents of phytoplankton, the base of the foodchain in aquatic environments. They infect and destroy bacteria in aquatic microbial communities, and are one of the most important mechanisms of recycling carbon and nutrient cycling in marine environments. The organic molecules released from the dead bacterial cells stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth, in a process known as the viral shunt. In particular, lysis of bacteria by viruses has been shown to enhance nitrogen cycling and stimulate phytoplankton growth.  Viral activity may also affect the biological pump, the process whereby carbon is sequestered in the deep ocean. Microorganisms constitute more than 90% of the biomass in the sea. It is estimated that viruses kill approximately 20% of this biomass each day and that there are 10 to 15 times as many viruses in the oceans as there are bacteria and archaea. Viruses are also major agents responsible for the destruction of phytoplankton including harmful algal blooms, The number of viruses in the oceans decreases further offshore and deeper into the water, where there are fewer host organisms. In January 2018, scientists reported that 800\u00a0million viruses, mainly of marine origin, are deposited daily from the Earth atmosphere onto every square meter of the planet's surface, as the result of a global atmospheric stream of viruses, circulating above the weather system but below the altitude of usual airline travel, distributing viruses around the planet. Like any organism, marine mammals are susceptible to viral infections. In 1988 and 2002, thousands of harbour seals were killed in Europe by phocine distemper virus. Many other viruses, including caliciviruses, herpesviruses, adenoviruses and parvoviruses, circulate in marine mammal populations."

Geneticists often use viruses as vectors to introduce genes into cells that they are studying. This is useful for making the cell produce a foreign substance, or to study the effect of introducing a new gene into the genome. Similarly, virotherapy uses viruses as vectors to treat various diseases, as they can specifically target cells and DNA. It shows promising use in the treatment of cancer and in gene therapy. Eastern European scientists have used phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics for some time, and interest in this approach is increasing, because of the high level of antibiotic resistance now found in some pathogenic bacteria. The expression of heterologous proteins by viruses is the basis of several manufacturing processes that are currently being used for the production of various proteins such as vaccine antigens and antibodies. Industrial processes have been recently developed using viral vectors and several pharmaceutical proteins are currently in pre-clinical and clinical trials."

As such, viruses are commonly used in materials science as scaffolds for covalently linked surface modifications. A particular quality of viruses is that they can be tailored by directed evolution. The powerful techniques developed by life sciences are becoming the basis of engineering approaches towards nanomaterials, opening a wide range of applications far beyond biology and medicine. Because of their size, shape, and well-defined chemical structures, viruses have been used as templates for organising materials on the nanoscale. Recent examples include work at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., using Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) particles to amplify signals in DNA microarray based sensors. In this application, the virus particles separate the fluorescent dyes used for signalling to prevent the formation of non-fluorescent dimers that act as quenchers.

Asking the principal for an extension, Priya searches for Ramesh and manages to find him. She humiliates him, while he denies that the pendrive is with him. After college one day, Ramesh and his friends see Priya on the road. They tease and infuriate her, eventually leading to her slapping him. A few days later, while Ramesh's mother (Mounika) is washing his pants, she finds the pendrive. Ramesh realizes that the fault is his and immediately goes to return the pendrive. Priya is impressed with his attitude, as she had expected him to keep the pendrive because she slapped him. This marks the beginning of their friendship. As time passes, Priya and Ramesh become closer. Urged by his friends, Ramesh goes to tell Priya that he loves her. However, while asking for money from his friend Kumar (Karunas), he accidentally takes the condom from Kumar's pocket. When Ramesh sees the condom, he tries to hide it from Priya. However, just then, the police arrives, and he is forced to drop it. Priya sees the condom and is shocked. She denies knowing Ramesh, resulting in him being taken to the police station. Ramesh is finally brought home and refuses to talk to Priya. His friends try to talk to her, but she does not listen. However, when her friend tells her how much Ramesh actually loves her, she is finally convinced. Ramesh had actually bought Priya a grain of rice with her name written on it.

The next day, Ravi sends Ramesh to Gujarat, as he fears for his safety. A few days later, the deceased's son appears in the commissioner's office with the elderly man, who claims that he can identify the boy who ran into him. Apparently, the deceased is an ex-MLA, and the commissioner decides to deal with the matter himself. The inspector warns Ravi and his gang, implying to them that the witness should be killed. Meanwhile, Priya receives a call from her mother telling her that her father is going for surgery and asks her to return to the US. Priya tells Ramesh that she will be waiting at the bus stop the next day, at the same place where they first met. If he loves her, he would come. The next day, eventually being coaxed by Kumar, Ramesh goes to see her. On the way, Ravi tries to kill him, but his conscience gets the better of him. However, he also knows that there is another goon in the same bus as Priya waiting to kill Ramesh. Ramesh manages to stand in front of Priya, and they hold hands for a while. Ramesh then slips off the steps and is run over by the bus. His mother, friends, and Priya mourn his death, while the goon who was supposed to kill him slips away. The movie ends with Priya in a car, looking at the grain of rice that has her name on it which Ramesh presented to her for her birthday."

Raynal stars in the film, her first as a director; she had previously worked for several years as a film editor, most notably for films in \u00c9ric Rohmer's \"Six Moral Tales\" series (she was, reportedly, the youngest professional editor in France at the time). The film's title, which literally translates as Twice and is sometimes translated into English as Twice Upon a Time, refers to the occasional repetition of scenes or actions. Gloriously shot in Black and White by Cinematographer Andr\u00e9 Weinfeld, Deux fois is one of the most notable of the Zanzibar Films, a group of feature-length experimental work made from 1968 to 1970 with the financing of Sylvina Boissonnas. It is also considered a landmark of Feminist filmmaking. Raynal made the film in nine days in Barcelona, Spain, casting a man she had met there, Francisco Viader, as one of the leads. Regarding the film, the influential French critic Serge Daney wrote: \"She put in her film the visionary crazed coldness of major paranoiacs. We also find the murderous, painful madness of Fritz Lang's great films, in which all the fiction is reduced to sketchy outlines, arabesques, leaving almost no trace.\""

He eventually signed a contract with the Mutual Film Corporation where he received a $25,000 advance and was promised 50% of the profits from the film for agreeing to let the company shoot his battles in daylight, and for re-enacting them if more footage was needed. (The contract resides in a museum in Mexico City at the Archivo Federico Gonzalez Garza, folio 3057.) Raoul Walsh wrote extensively about the experience in his autobiography Each Man in His Time, describing Villa's charisma as well as noting that peasants would knock the teeth out of corpses with rocks in the wake of firing squads in order to harvest the gold fillings, which was captured on film and had the projectionists vomiting in the screening room back in Los Angeles. The following year, Walsh played John Wilkes Booth in Griffith's epic The Birth of a Nation and directed the first gangster movie, Regeneration, on location in the Bowery on the Lower East Side of Manhattan."

        "content": "Micky Ward is an American welterweight boxer from Lowell, Massachusetts. Managed by his mother, Alice Ward, and trained by his older half-brother, Dicky Eklund, Micky became a \"stepping stone\" for other boxers to defeat on their way up. Dicky, a former boxer whose peak of success was going the distance with Sugar Ray Leonard in 1978, has become addicted to crack cocaine. He is being filmed for an HBO documentary he believes to be about his \"comeback\". On the night of an undercard fight in Atlantic City, Micky's scheduled opponent is ill, and a substitute is found who is 20 pounds heavier than Micky, a huge difference in professional boxing, constituting two or three weight classes. Despite Micky's reservations, his mother and brother agree so that they can all get the purse, but Micky is defeated. Micky retreats from the world and forms a relationship with Charlene Fleming, a former college athlete who dropped out and became a bartender. After several weeks, Alice arranges another fight for Micky, but Micky is concerned it will turn out the same. His mother and seven sisters blame Charlene for his lack of motivation. Micky mentions he received an offer to be paid to train in Las Vegas, but Dicky says he will match the offer so he can keep training and working with his family. Dicky then tries to get money by posing his girlfriend as a prostitute and then, once she picks up a client, impersonating a police officer to steal the client's money. This is foiled by the actual police and Dicky is arrested after a chase and a fight with them. Micky tries to stop the police from beating his brother and a police officer brutally breaks his hand before arresting him. At their arraignment, Micky is released, but Dicky is sent to jail. Micky washes his hands of Dicky. On the night of the HBO documentary's airing, Dicky's family, and Dicky himself in prison, are horrified to see that it is called Crack in America and depicts how crack addiction ruined Dicky's career and life. Dicky begins training and trying to get his life together in prison. Micky is lured back into boxing by his father, who believes Alice and his stepson Dicky are bad influences. The other members of his training team and a new manager, Sal Lanano, persuade Micky to return to boxing with the explicit understanding that his mother and brother will no longer be involved. They place Micky in minor fights to help him regain his confidence. He is then offered another major fight against an undefeated up-and-coming boxer. During a prison visit, Dicky advises Micky on how best to work his opponent, but Micky feels his brother is being selfish and trying to restart his own failed career. During the actual match, Micky is nearly overwhelmed, but then implements his brother's advice and triumphs; he earns the title shot for which his opponent was being groomed. Upon his release from prison, Dicky and his mother go to see Micky train. Assuming things are as they were, Dicky prepares to spar with his brother, but Micky informs him that he is no longer allowed per Micky's agreement with his current team. In the ensuing argument, in which Micky chastises both factions of his family, Charlene and his trainer leave in disgust. Micky and Dicky spar until Micky knocks Dicky down. Dicky storms off, presumably to get high again, and Alice chides Micky, only to be sobered when he tells her that she has always favored Dicky. Dicky returns to his crack house, where he says goodbye to his friends and heads to Charlene's apartment. He tells her that Micky needs both of them and they need to work together. After bringing everyone back together, the group goes to London for the title fight against welterweight champion Shea Neary. Micky scores another upset victory and the welterweight title. The film jumps a few years ahead, with Dicky crediting his brother as the creator of his own success. The real-life brothers banter as the end credits run."

        "content": "Mark Wahlberg as Micky Ward: Wahlberg elected to star in the film due to his friendship with Ward, with whom he shares an inner-city working class Massachusetts upbringing in a family with eight siblings. Wahlberg also was a huge fan of Ward's, calling him a \"local sports hero\". The actor was also attracted to the film's central theme, an ordinary person in \"an against-all-odds story\", which he previously explored in Invincible. To mimic Ward's habits and mannerisms, Wahlberg had him \"on set, watching me every single day\". During pre-production, the Ward brothers temporarily moved into Wahlberg's home. To add to the film's realism, Wahlberg refused a stunt double and took real punches during the fight scenes, which resulted in him nearly getting his nose broken a couple of times. Wahlberg underwent a strict bodybuilding exercise regimen, dedicating over four years of training to obtain a muscular physique to convincingly play Ward. \"The last six movies I did I was also secretly preparing for The Fighter at the same time\", the actor continued, \"so I would leave three hours early for work and go to the gym and spend three hours there. I would bring the trainers with me on every movie that I did.\" His uncertainty over the film's development was overruled by his persistence to get the film made. \"There were certainly times where I would wake up at 4:30 in the morning, you know, my trainer would ring the bell, and, 'Oh God', I'm like, 'I better get this movie made'. You know, 'Kill somebody if I don't get this movie made.'\" Wahlberg hired Freddie Roach as his boxing trainer, helping the actor model Ward's specific fighting style. The last two years of Wahlberg's training resulted in the construction of a \"dream gym\" in his house for daily use, with a personal boxing ring. He received additional boxing preparation from Manny Pacquiao. Christian Bale as Dick \"Dicky\" Eklund: After both Brad Pitt and Matt Damon dropped out due to scheduling conflicts, Eminem was talked to and considered for the role of Eklund, but he ultimately wasn't cast due to recording conflicts with his music. Wahlberg suggested Bale for the role after meeting the actor at a preschool their daughters both attended. Given Eklund's drug addiction, Bale had to lose weight, which he found easy as he had lost 63 pounds in 2003 for The Machinist. Bale researched the part by taking notes on Eklund's mannerisms and recording conversations for the character's distinctive Boston accent. Director David O. Russell believed Bale's task involved far more than mimicry. \"Dicky has a whole rhythm to him, a music. Christian had to understand how his mind works.\" Russell and Eklund were both impressed by Bale's dedication to staying in character throughout filming. Bale went on to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor at the 83rd Academy Awards for his performance. Amy Adams as Charlene Fleming, Ward's real-life girlfriend and wife: Russell said of the actress: \"There are very few things that a director can have at his disposal better than an actress who's dying to break type and is extremely motivated to break type. Amy was extremely motivated to play a sexy bitch, and that's who the character of Charlene is. ... She said: 'As long as it happens between action and cut, I'll do anything.\" And I said: 'That's my kind of actress.' I loved that she had that attitude.\" Adams was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress at the 83rd Academy Awards. Melissa Leo as Alice Eklund-Ward, mother of both fighters and their seven siblings, all sisters. Leo won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress at the 83rd Academy Awards. Jack McGee as George Ward, Micky's father."

Eric Johnson and Paul Tamasy were also hired to write the screenplay, which was rewritten by Lewis Colick. Mark Wahlberg joined the production in early 2005, with the intention of doing Ward's life story \"justice. We don't want to do any over-the-top, unrealistic fight scenes.\" Paramount Pictures, the United States distributor of the film, hired Paul Attanasio to rewrite Collick's draft in February 2007 in an attempt to emphasize the themes of brotherhood and redemption. Hoping to start production in Massachusetts in June 2007, Wahlberg had Martin Scorsese read the screenplay, hoping he would direct. Scorsese turned down the offer, finding the Massachusetts-setting redundant after having finished The Departed. The actor cited Scorsese's Raging Bull as an influence for The Fighter, but Scorsese was not interested in directing another boxing film. Darren Aronofsky was hired to direct in March 2007, with Scott Silver rewriting the script in September 2007. Paul Attanasio was also brought in as a script doctor to work on the film prior to shooting. Production proceeded with filming set to begin October 2008 and Christian Bale replaced Brad Pitt. By then Aronofsky had dropped out to work on MGM's RoboCop remake, followed by Black Swan. Wahlberg and Bale chose David O. Russell as Aronofsky's replacement. Wahlberg had also starred in Russell's Three Kings and I Heart Huckabees. Aronofsky was given an executive producer credit for his contributions on The Fighter, and was enthusiastic to have Russell as the director. In April 2009, Relativity Media stepped up to entirely finance the film, selling the international distribution rights to The Weinstein Company a month later. The Fighter began principal photography on July 13, 2009, on an $11 million budget in a 33-day shooting schedule, which was half the budget that Paramount was working with. The production utilized Massachusetts' film tax credits to cover parts of the film's cost."

When she arrives there with the police accompanying her, she catches sight of a man in the distance wearing an old coat of her husband's. When he is pursued and captured, he turns out to be Duds Morrison, a former soldier and out-of-work actor recently let out of prison. He refuses to tell them anything, and having nothing they can charge him with, the police release him. His interest aroused by the pictures sent to Meg, her new fianc\u00e9 Geoffrey Leavitt follows Morrison and tries to demand an answer from him about his sudden appearance masquerading as Meg\u2019s dead husband. Morrison again refuses to talk, and tries to flee from Leavitt - into an alley where he is set upon by a gang of ex-soldiers who beat him to death and take Leavitt off as a prisoner. It is soon revealed that they are ex-commandos, and former comrades of Morrison, with whom they served on a raid in Brittany in the Second World War. The commander of the raid had been Meg's husband, Major Elgin. The men had been led to believe that Elgin secreted a large amount of treasure in a house in Brittany. Now that he is dead they are desperate to get their hands on it. They are wary of their former sergeant, a psychopath named Jack Havoc, who has recently escaped from prison, committed several murders, and is also seeking out the treasure. They had attacked Morrison because they believed he was an accomplice of Havoc. Wearing their old uniforms they have spent the past few years trying to carve out a living as street musicians, begging from passers by. Realising that releasing Leavitt might open them to being charged for the murder of Morrison, they bind him up and keep him as a prisoner. He is rescued later by a beat constable who investigates the squat while the musicians are out. Leavitt returns to Meg and together they head to Brittany to find the treasure. Havoc, now united with his former comrades, also travels to France where he discovers to his disgust that when Major Elgin had spoken of his \u2018priceless\u2019 treasure, he had in fact been referring to its artistic beauty rather than its monetary worth. The treasure is in fact a statue of the Madonna."

Sam has single-handedly brought up his son since his wife died in a swimming accident 14 years ago and looks after him day and night. Upon discovering Sam has less than five months to live, he multiplies his efforts to help Dafu learn basic tasks in order to care for himself, as well as searching for a home for him, before he passes away. As the story progresses, the growing relationship between father and son, as well as the community around them, become clearer. Ling ling (Gwei Lun-mei) plays the role of a clown who is part of a small traveling circus (they perform in the aquarium for a short period of time) and who gets on well with Dafu, leading to a close friendship between them. Though Dafu struggles to learn many basic tasks, Sam perseveres in teaching his son the tasks that he will need to know how to perform himself once his father dies. Though Sam never gave up teaching and explaining things to Dafu in a positive and supportive and memorable manner, he did contemplate ending his and Dafu's existence together rather than leave his child to suffer without him. Sam, at this point had yet to tell anyone how far his health had deteriorated, until one day while returning from their hometown, his neighbor tells Sam his doctor came from the city with bags of free medicine and waited two hours for him. Meanwhile, Principal Liu, of the boarding school for mentally challenged children that Dafu attended as a child, recommends Dafu to a newly opened institution where he can stay after his father dies. Dafu continues learning, though Sam must move into the institution with him to help him adjust. Ling Ling, knowing that she is about to have to leave with her circus, teaches Dafu to pick up the phone in the aquarium when he hears it, and she will talk to him. Ling Ling leaves with her circus. Sam, for the first time in the movie, swims in the aquarium with his son, dressed in a sea turtle costume he made by hand, telling his son not to be afraid when he is gone; he will be like the turtles in the aquarium, always swimming close by with him. He almost drowns but is helped from water by Mr. Tang and while they chat, Sam reveals his wife's death might not have been an accident as she was a very good swimmer and they had recently found out Dafu is autistic. Sam doesn't blame her for not being able to handle their son's circumstances. There was only one instance in which Sam loses his composure with Dafu, while he is nearing the end, and still working and trying to teach his son how to do his job, Dafu is distracted and Sam yells at him. Less than a moment later and Sam is already mending fences and reassuring his son. Sam eventually dies, and his funeral is attended by close friends and family. Dafu waves good bye to the sky/Sam, as it seems he has learned people live there, something Ling Ling explained to him earlier when she spoke of her grandmother with him before she left town. After the funeral, Dafu is seen doing some of the things that his father struggled so much to teach him with success. He cooks by himself, knows how to ride the bus, and picks up the phone when Ling Ling calls, and working at the ocean park, a place Mr. has opened the doors for Dafu at any time of the day. It is implied that from then on, Dafu will know how to lead his life on his own, though he still has Sam's old friends helping him along the way."

When I read the script, I cried. I hope to express gratitude to all the parents in the world through the film.\" Jet Li did not take any pay for the film. Jet Li hoped the movie will encourage people pay more attention and dedicate their compassion to charity. TIME magazine named Jet Li one of its Most Influential People this year for his work with his One Foundation. Li revealed that four or five years ago, his nephew had been diagnosed with autism. His nephew is now better, but this incident made him realize how important it is to offer attention and care to those who have been diagnosed and their families. Li admitted that it was not easy to interpret his character. Because Jet Li's father died when he was two years old, he didn't understand the concept of the word \"father\" for a long time. When he was filming The Shaolin Temple, there was a line where he had to yell b\u00e0 ba (dad), which he found himself unable to say: \"In the end, the director changed it to di\u0113 (another word for dad). I thought di\u0113  had nothing to do with me, so I could say it. It wasn't until I became a father that I clearly understood what this role of a father meant.\" Another difficulty is that Li can't swim, but he eventually swam as the story required."

Raja's maternal uncle Govindayya, a pleader, wants him to marry his daughter Chitti, who is in a relationship with Bheemudu, a bodybuilder. Raja rejects the proposal and Govindayya offers to find a suitable bridegroom for Ammadu if Raja marries Chitti. Raja rejects the proposal and with Kundu he sets out to find a suitable bridegroom for Ammadu. In a distant village, Raja and Kundu meet Dhoopati Viyyanna, a zamindar and the president of the panchayat. Viyyanna is a complex character of declining fortunes and generous spirit who believes in respecting his guests. Raju and Viyyanna's daughter Savitri fall in love and their wedding is quickly arranged. Viyyanna also finds a bridegroom named Venkata Ramana, a pleader living in Madras, for Ammadu. Ramana's father, Venkatapathy, demands a large dowry, which Viyyanna promises to pay. At the marriage venue, Govindayya plots revenge by inciting Venkatapathy to insist on the dowry being paid before the marriage. Viyyanna issues a promisory note; Venkatapathy rejects it and drags Ramana from the marriage hall. However, Ramana leaves for Madras and lives there with Ammadu. When Venkatapathy arrives, Ramana feigns mental illness while Ammadu and Raja pretend to be a nurse and a doctor. Ammadu endears herself to Venkatapathy by showing interest in his recitals of the puranas. Ramana 'recovers' from the mental illness and Ammadu, who has been pregnant, gives birth to their son, causing a fresh round of gossip in the village. Govindayya tries to take advantage of this and after numerous failed attempts, he persuades Venkatapathy to conduct Ramana's marriage with Chitti. Viyyanna considers this to be an insult and conducts the marriage of Chitti and Bheemudu at his residence. Govindayya and his wife Chukkalamma refuse to acknowledge the marriage. When Venkatapathy asks Ramana to marry Chitti, he refuses and foregoes the wealth he is entitled to inherit in exchange for Ammadu and their newborn son. Govindayya asks Venkatapathy to marry Chitti and Chukkalamma protests, reuniting Chitti and Bheemudu. A helpless Govindayya is confronted by Viyyanna, who threatens to use his influence as a president of the panchayat to have him arrested if he does not reform himself. Govindayya begs pardon and flees with his family. The film ends with everyone present in Ramana's house, laughing maniacally."

        "content": "After producing Shavukaru (1950) and Pathala Bhairavi (1951), B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani announced a film titled Pelli Chesi Choodu, which would be directed by L. V. Prasad and financed by their company Vijaya Vauhini Studios. Pelli Chesi Choodu was made as a bilingual film; it was shot simultaneously in Telugu and Tamil, with the Tamil version titled Kalyanam Panni Paar, the first Tamil film directed by Prasad. Chakrapani wrote the film's script, which was based on the negative effects of the dowry system in India. Marcus Bartley was recruited as the cinematographer and the film was edited by  C. P. Jambulingam and M. S. Money. Madhavapeddi Gokhale and Kaladhar were the film's art directors, and the music score was composed by Ghantasala. Chalapathi Rao and Jagannadham were the production executives. Pasumarthi Krishnamurthy choreographed the song sequences. T. Prakash Rao worked as an assistant director under Prasad; Rao directed Palletooru (1952) during the post-production phase of Pelli Chesi Choodu. Kalyanam Panni Paar was partly colourised using Gevacolor. N. T. Rama Rao and G. Varalakshmi were chosen as one of the leading pairs of actors. During the songs' shoot, Ghantasala taught Rama Rao to play the harmonium and gave him a few music lessons so he would look believable in the film. Yandamuri Jogarao and Savitri, who had played minor roles in Shavukar and Pathala Bhairavi, were chosen as the other leading pair. In playing the role of the zamindar, S. V. Ranga Rao exhibited a strange body language, inspired by a stranger he had observed at a railway station. Sivarama Krishnayya and C.V.V. Panthulu played the role of Rama Rao's father in the Telugu and Tamil versions. Padmanabham played two roles; a postman and Ranga Rao's friend. The child artists in the film were members of Nyapathi Raghavarao's 'Balanandam' troupe. They were trained by Gnapadi Kameswara Rao, whose nephew Gade Balakrishna \"Kundu\" Rao played a key role in the film's Telugu and Tamil versions. Vijaya Vauhini Studios hired actors on a monthly salaried basis for this film; one of these was M. Mallikarjuna Rao, who later directed films Prameelarjuneeyam (1965), Muhurtha Balam (1969), and Gudachari 116 (1976). Differences between Chakrapani and Varalakshmi occurred during the last stage of principal photography. Chakrapani wanted to replace Varalakshmi with Anjali Devi and reshoot the entire film. However, Devi mediated between them and resolved the differences. Differences between Rama Rao and Varalakshmi due to the latter's tantrums, also occurred. When Varalakshmi refused to touch Rama Rao's feet in the scene in which his father drags him from the marriage hall, Prasad asked Nagi Reddy's son B. L. N. Prasad\u2014the second assistant cameraman working under Bartley\u2014to wear a dhoti and stand before her. Chakrapani liked a scene in a play in which a group of police officers in ascending hierarchy, each junior gave up his chair for the senior; he used the same idea in Savitri's marriage sequences in the film. Similarly, Prasad incorporated part of a stage play enacted by children into the film, which Nagi Reddy's son Venkatarami Reddy was a part of. Prasad also made a cameo appearance in the film. Mohan Kanda, who later became the Chief Secretary of Andhra Pradesh before its bifurcation, also appeared in the film as a child artist. The final reel length of both versions was ."

The song \"Ezhumalai Andavaney\", sung by P. Leela for Kalyanam Panni Paar, is based on the carnatic raga known as Chakravakam. The song \"Pelli Chesukoni\" was composed using the Kalyani raga. Ghantasala recorded the songs \"Manasa Nenevaro Neeku Thelusa\" and \"Yedukondalavada Venkataramana\" first with Jikki. He was not satisfied and recorded them again with P.

It is the Telugu version of Prasad's Tamil film Kadan Vaangi Kalyaanam (1958). Starring N. T. Rama Rao and Savitri, Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu features Jaggayya, C. S. R. Anjaneyulu, S. V.

His shrewd, schizophrenic manager Bhaja Govindam placates angry creditors with false promises. Dewan Bahadur Mukunda Rao, a wealthy, generous zamindar, is searching for a royal bridegroom for his granddaughter Manjari. Ramadasu plans to marry his son Raghu, a doctor practising in London, to Manjari to pay his debts. Unbeknownst to his father, though, Raghu has married a woman named Leela. Ramadasu first bribes Rao's manager, Ramalingam. Rao, unaware of the deception, agrees to the alliance. Manjari, who knows the truth, wants to stop the marriage. Leela's brother, Raja, is released from prison after serving a sentence for his participation in the Indian independence movement. Raja and Manjari were lovers during their college days, and she tells him about Ramadasu's intentions. After Raghu arrives from London, Ramadasu misleads him into thinking that Leela has died. When Raja asks Ramadasu to spare Leela, he sends mobsters to attack him. Raja overpowers them, cornering Ramadasu later, and Leela stays in his home disguised as a mute maid. Govindam, fed up with Ramadasu, wants to expose his dishonesty to his creditors. Govindam's relationship with Ramalingam's daughter, Usha, is strained. Ramalingam's attempts to marry her off are thwarted by Govindam. To reunite Leela and Raghu, Raja disguises himself as Prince Bonkulamarri Raja and enters Rao's house aided by Govindam's schizophrenia. Rao is impressed with Raja and considers him a suitable bridegroom for Manjari, who is aware of and supports Raja's plans. Raghu recognises Leela and is affectionate to her, which bothers Ramadasu. Despite his opposition to his father's intentions, Raghu continues to flirt with Manjari and play the prospective bridegroom. Raja and Govindam use a number of disguises in an attempt to expose Ramadasu's greed. Raghu introduces a foreign woman to Ramadasu as his demanding wife, who forces his father to incur more debt until he is cornered by his creditors. Ramalingam's deception is exposed, and Ramadasu apologises for his misdeeds. Raghu and Leela reconcile; Raja marries Manjari, and Govindam marries Usha."

During the journey, Susan has a shipboard romance with Conn White (Grant Williams), a wealthy young mountain climber. Susan and Conn make love in secret and plan to marry, but Conn wants to hold off making any announcement to their families until after he returns from his scheduled trip to Alaska to climb Mount McKinley.  He travels on to Anchorage, while Susan and her parents go to Monterey and move into a home provided by Roger's grateful employer and longtime friend, Stanton Corbett (Brian Aherne). Roger has a serious heart condition which he has kept from his wife and daughter so as not to worry them; he has confided only in Stanton, who gave him a house, laboratory and life income so that Roger could rest and recover while giving his wife and daughter social opportunities. Susan waits eagerly for letters from Conn, but he does not write and the one time he calls, she is out and misses the call. She soon discovers that she is pregnant with Conn's child, but keeps this a secret while urgently trying to contact Conn. Her parents attempt to take her mind off Conn by encouraging her to date the Corbetts' son Wells (Bert Convy) and buying her a horse, which is kept at the stables run by Hoyt Brecker (Troy Donahue). Hoyt is shunned by the local community because his father, an executive with Corbett's company, was convicted for stealing from his employer, and later committed suicide in his prison cell. Compared to Susan's family and friends, Hoyt is relatively poor and lives on what he can earn from his stables (which have lost many customers due to the scandal involving his father) and as a struggling writer. Despite all this, Hoyt and Susan gradually become friends and he confides in her his determination to not run away in the face of local disapproval, but to instead become a renowned writer and redeem his family name. Susan finally receives a telephone call from Conn's father, whom she has never met, informing her that Conn had told his parents of his love for her and that Conn died climbing Mount McKinley. Susan has a breakdown and tries to drown herself in the bay, but is rescued by Hoyt. In her delirium, she lets slip to her mother that she is pregnant by Conn. Roger and Leah decide the only way to avoid disgrace and protect Susan is for the family to move to remote Guatemala, where Roger has been offered a two-year job running a mine. Susan can then finish her pregnancy and have her baby in secret, and Leah and Roger will pass it off as their own. All goes according to plan, but after the baby (named \"Rogey\" after Susan's father) is born, Susan has difficulty setting aside her maternal feelings and treating the baby as her brother rather than her son. Roger's heart condition worsens due to the stressful work at the mine, and he suddenly dies. Leah, Susan and baby Rogey return to their Monterey home, which Susan is dismayed to find has now been fixed up by the unsuspecting Corbetts to give her an apartment of her own, separated from the baby's room. Hoyt and Susan, who have been writing to each other regularly, renew their friendship and Hoyt professes his love for Susan, but Wells Corbett also begins to court Susan and soon proposes. Leah pushes Susan to accept Wells' proposal, but warns her never to tell Wells or anyone else the truth about Rogey's parentage, for fear that Rogey, Susan and the family name will be disgraced. Susan is reluctant to marry anyone because she would not be able to be honest with her future husband, but finally decides to marry Wells, just as Hoyt sells his first book to a publisher and rushes to tell Susan the good news. Hoyt and Susan argue over her decision to marry Wells, as Hoyt has a grudge against the Corbetts and also thinks Susan does not really love Wells. As they argue, baby Rogey accidentally sets himself on fire while playing with a cigarette lighter. Rogey is rushed to the hospital and the Corbetts, Slades and Hoyt all wait to hear the outcome. The doctor finally announces that Rogey will survive, but is seriously hurt and only his mother can see him. Susan, unable to hold back any longer, reveals that she is Rogey's true mother, which causes Wells to rescind his marriage proposal, although his father Stanton praises Susan for her honesty. However, Hoyt's feelings for Susan have not changed. Susan professes her true love for Hoyt, and they embrace."

The invalid patriarch 'Pa' Mooney (Douglas Phair) is a retired medical doctor who claims to be 180 years old. His eldest daughter, Phoebe (Joan Ogden), more or less cares for him and is head of the household. His eldest son, Mortimer (Noel Collins), is a businessman who conducts the finances of the family and contributes to the family income. Younger daughter Monica (Hope Stansbury) is a sadist who keeps live rats as pets and frequently mutilates them and other small animals. Youngest son Malcolm (Berwick Kaler) is a halfwit with animalistic tendencies; the family keeps him locked in a room with live chickens. The family has a secret: they are all werewolves-natural born werewolves who transform once a month on the night of the full moon. Pa Mooney has been researching for years to find a way to break the family curse. Youngest daughter Diana (Jackie Skarvellis) returns home from medical school in Scotland with a new husband, a former classmate named Gerald (Ian Innes), of whom Pa Mooney heartily disapproves. Pa tells Diana that she is the last hope the family has to overcome the ancient curse, since she is the only member of the family who does not turn into a werewolf on the night of the full moon. Will Diana succeed? Diana is eventually revealed to have other plans, and on top of that, she has her own secret as to why she is \"different\" from the other werewolves of the Mooney family."

Some scenes were filmed nearly two years later in Staten Island at the request of producer William Mishkin to pad out the short running time. Because of the film's low budget, Milligan actually acted in at least two different roles during the production under two different names which included playing a gunsmith who sells Diana a pistol containing silver bullets, as well as a pawnshop owner named Mr. Micawber in the re-shot scenes involving Monica and the rats (which were added after Willard achieved popularity). The film was released on VHS by Midnight Video in the 1980s."

It was one of the few films in Malayalam that discussed about naxals. After M. T. Vasudevan Nair completed the screenplay of Panchagni, Hariharan decided to produce the film himself under his company Gayathri Cinema. During the pre-production of the film, G. P. Vijayakumar telephoned Hariharan and informed his wish to produce a Hariharan-M.T. Vasudevan Nair film under his newly formed production company, Seven Arts. Hariharan agreed and hand over the production to Vijayakumar. Initially, Naseeruddin Shah was cast in the role of news reporter Rasheed, per the suggestion of Nair. Shah signed the film and was given advance payment. Later, Mohanlal met Hariharan informing his wish to act in their film, but the casting process was already over by then, so he had to return him. But after that meeting, Hariharan had a change of mind with the thought of casting him in the role of Rasheed, he talked the matter with Nair and Mohanlal was fixed. In a later interview in 2000, Hariharan recalled: \"when we asked Mohanlal whether he would do the film, he said he would do 'any role'. The first thing I wanted was to give him a different appearance. Till then, he hadn't appeared without a moustache. So I asked him to shave it off. He immediately agreed. Panchagni went on to become a turning point in his career\". Initially, Ambika was chosen for the role of Indira, but she could not sign the film due to scheduling conflicts with a Kannada film, which she later regrets. Geetha was finalised for the role. Ambika said in a later interview in 2017 that Panchagni and Chithram are the two films in her career that she feels sad about that she could not join."

Legally the French may not fish within a three-mile limit of the British coast, and vice versa, and breaches of this rule are the cause of frequent spats between the two countries. In this instance, hot-headed Cornish harbour-master Nat Pomeroy confronts Lanec Florrie, an equally redoubtable widow in charge of an otherwise male crew, from a Breton port. Beneath all the bluster and posturing however, there is a mutual understanding and respect between the two communities. Widower Nat's daughter, Sue Pomeroy, has been friends since childhood with local boy Bob Tremayne, and their eventual marriage has been taken as a foregone conclusion.  During a visit by the Cornish contingent to Brittany a wrestling match is arranged between Bob and Lanec's son Yan, during which Yan breaks a bone, to the concern of Sue.  Yan is attracted to Sue and begins actively to woo her, with great success.  Sue is torn between her own attraction to Yan and her unspoken commitment to Bob, a situation which leads to increased friction between the two communities.  However, when war-related danger ensues, both sides realise that their unity in common cause against the mutual German enemy, and that it is more important than petty squabbles.  Bob is called up to serve in the British navy, and in a showdown conversation with Yan before he leaves, the two agree that Sue must be allowed to follow her own heart. Yan comes to Cornwall to also serve in war duties. With most men absent, a loose sea mine drifts into the Cornish harbour and Lanec bravely mans a ship to net it and tow it out, making her a local hero and easing the tensions. She eventually pushes Sue and Yan to marry, which they do without Pomeroy's consent."

Hustler then published a press release with a series of fake parody films (including Glee and FOX News); one of the films listed was an Avatar parody, and the producers at Hustler and Braun began serious discussions about the creation of an Avatar porn film. In March 2010, Hustler announced that Braun would be officially directing the film. Marc Star was tapped by Hustler to write the screenplay, where he came up with the idea of having the film take place after the end of the original Avatar, and to have the sex scenes shown through video logs before and during the original film. In order to avoid confusion with it actually being part of James Cameron's Avatar universe, the names of many objects in the universe are subtly changed to parody the original Avatar. The Na'vi are referred to as Na'bi, the planet Pandora was renamed to Panwhora, and instead of being after unobtainium, the humans are after viagratanium. In order to film the 3D sequences, Hustler contacted an outside company with 3D expertise to train their personnel and to lease their equipment. The director struggled to maneuver the 3D cameras during some of the sequences, but Braun was pleased with the end result. In order to achieve a look similar to that of the blue Na'vi from Avatar, makeup artists used gallons of blue paint on the Na'bi actresses in order to achieve a close look to that of the film. Prosthetics were attached to the performers' faces to simulate their alien nature. The film finished production in late June 2010. Hustler released the trailer for this film's unique texture and 3D effects in September 2010."

Lemorande also initially designed and created two of the creatures, and was an editor of the film.

Captain EO's alien crew consists of his small flying sidekick Fuzzball, the double-headed navigator and pilot Geek (Idy and Ody), robotic security officer Major Domo, a small robot, Minor Domo (who fits like a module into Major Domo), and the clumsy elephant-like shipmate Hooter, who always manages to upset the crew's missions. Upon arriving on the planet, the crew is captured by the henchmen of the Supreme Leader, and brought before her. She sentences the crew to be turned into trash cans, and Captain EO to 100 years of torture in her deepest dungeon. Before being sent away, Captain EO tells the Supreme Leader that he sees the beauty hidden within her, and that he brings her the key to unlock it: his song, \"We Are Here to Change the World\". The two robot members of the crew transform into musical instruments, and the crew members begin to play the various instruments. As Hooter runs toward his instrument, he trips over EO's cape and breaks it, stopping the music. The spell broken, the Supreme Leader orders her guards to capture Captain EO and his crew. Hooter manages to repair his instrument and sends out a blast of music, providing EO with the power to throw off the guards. He uses his power to transform the dark hulking guards into agile dancers who fall into step behind him for a dance number, which leads into the song, \"We Are Here to Change the World\". The Supreme Leader unleashes her Whip Warriors, two cybernetic defenders each with a whip and shield that can deflect EO's power. The others all run away, leaving Captain EO to fight the Whip Warriors alone. EO is trapped by a closing gate and prepares for a last stand as both the whip warriors draw their whips back for a final blow. Fuzzball drops his instrument and speedily flies over to tie the two whips together, causing the Whip Warriors to be thrown off balance and giving EO an opportunity to transform them as well. With no further obstacles, EO uses his power to transform the remaining four henchmen (not yet unleashed) and they, the transformed whip warriors and the other dancers, press forward in dance. Captain EO then flies up to the Supreme Leader and transforms her into a beautiful woman, her lair into a peaceful Greek temple, and the planet into a paradise. A celebration breaks out to \"Another Part of Me\", as Captain EO and his crew triumphantly exit and fly off into space, ending the film."

After the death of Michael Jackson on June 25, 2009, Captain EO regained popularity on the Internet. For several years, a small group of fans had petitioned Disney to bring back the attraction and Jackson's death had brought this campaign to a peak. Soon afterward, Disney officials were seen in Disneyland at the Magic Eye Theater and reportedly held a private screening of Captain EO to determine if it could be shown again. On September 10, Disney CEO Bob Iger said, \"There aren't plans to bring back Captain EO at this time ... We are looking at it. It's the kind of thing that, if we did it, would get a fair amount of attention and we'd want to make sure we do it right.\" On December 18, 2009, Disney announced that Captain EO would return to Tomorrowland at Disneyland, beginning in February 2010. Social and Print Media Manager Heather Hust Rivera from Disneyland Resort confirmed this on the DisneyParks Blog and stated that Honey, I Shrunk the Audience! would be closing. That attraction hosted its final public showing in the Magic Eye Theater at midnight on January 4, 2010, to make way for Captain EO's return. The attraction reopened at Disneyland on February 23, 2010 and subsequently returned to Discoveryland at Disneyland Park (Paris) on June 12, 2010, to Epcot at Walt Disney World on July 2, and to Tokyo Disneyland on July 1. At Epcot, the film had a \"soft opening\" (actual opening to the public prior to the official opening) on June 30, two days prior to its official reopening. The attraction's return was billed as \"Captain EO Tribute\" to distinguish the presentation of the film from its original 1986\u20131997 run. The new presentation made use of existing in-theater special effects held over from Honey, I Shrunk the Audience!, but many of the original \"4-D\" effects\u2014such as the enormous fiber-optic \"starfield\" wall, along with smoke and lasers\u2014had been removed from the building at the show's first closing and were not returned for the revived presentation. The removed special effects from the original presentation are also missing in the Epcot, Tokyo Disneyland, and Disneyland Paris revivals that followed.

Photographed by Sandi Sissel. The focus of the film is the government cover-up of the health hazards related to the 1950s atomic bomb testing in Nevada. Paul Jacobs, a journalist, activist and co-founder of the magazine Mother Jones, investigated the results of the tests on unknowing civilians and soldiers used as guinea pigs.  Jacobs died of lung cancer before the film was completed; his doctors believed he contracted cancer as a result of radiation exposure. The film was shown on PBS in the United States and widely distributed on television and theatrically in Europe. It was censored by Swedish Television during the time of a referendum on nuclear energy in Sweden. The film won an Emmy Award (1980), George Polk Award for investigative journalism on TV, Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award, and Best Documentary at the Mannheim Film Festival."

        "content": "Galileo di Vincenzo Bonaiuti de' Galilei ( , ; 15 February 1564\u00a0\u2013 8 January 1642), commonly referred to as Galileo, was an Italian astronomer, physicist and engineer, sometimes described as a polymath, from the city of Pisa, then part of the Duchy of Florence. Galileo has been called the \"father\" of observational astronomy, modern physics, the scientific method, and modern science. Galileo studied speed and velocity, gravity and free fall, the principle of relativity, inertia, projectile motion and also worked in applied science and technology, describing the properties of pendulums and \"hydrostatic balances\". He invented the thermoscope and various military compasses, and used the telescope for scientific observations of celestial objects. His contributions to observational astronomy include telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus, observation of the four largest satellites of Jupiter, observation of Saturn's rings, and analysis of lunar craters and sunspots. Galileo's championing of Copernican heliocentrism (Earth rotating daily and revolving around the sun) was met with opposition from within the Catholic Church and from some astronomers. The matter was investigated by the Roman Inquisition in 1615, which concluded that heliocentrism was foolish, absurd, and heretical since it contradicted Holy Scripture. Galileo later defended his views in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (1632), which appeared to attack Pope Urban VIII and thus alienated both the Pope and the Jesuits, who had both supported Galileo up until this point. He was tried by the Inquisition, found \"vehemently suspect of heresy\", and forced to recant. He spent the rest of his life under house arrest. During this time, he wrote Two New Sciences (1638), primarily concerning kinematics and the strength of materials, summarizing work he had done around forty years earlier."

        "content": "Galileo was born in Pisa (then part of the Duchy of Florence), Italy, on 15 February 1564, the first of six children of Vincenzo Galilei, a lutenist, composer, and music theorist, and Giulia Ammannati, who had married in 1562. Galileo became an accomplished lutenist himself and would have learned early from his father a scepticism for established authority. Three of Galileo's five siblings survived infancy. The youngest, Michelangelo (or Michelagnolo), also became a lutenist and composer who contributed to Galileo's financial burdens for the rest of his life. Michelangelo was unable to contribute his fair share of their father's promised dowries to their brothers-in-law, who would later attempt to seek legal remedies for payments due. Michelangelo would also occasionally have to borrow funds from Galileo to support his musical endeavours and excursions. These financial burdens may have contributed to Galileo's early desire to develop inventions that would bring him additional income. When Galileo Galilei was eight, his family moved to Florence, but he was left under the care of Muzio Tedaldi for two years. When Galileo was ten, he left Pisa to join his family in Florence and there he was under the tutelage of Jacopo Borghini. He was educated, particularly in logic, from 1575 to 1578 in the Vallombrosa Abbey, about 30\u00a0km southeast of Florence."

        "content": "Galileo tended to refer to himself only by his given name. At the time, surnames were optional in Italy, and his given name had the same origin as his sometimes-family name, Galilei. Both his given and family name ultimately derive from an ancestor, Galileo Bonaiuti, an important physician, professor, and politician in Florence in the 15th century. Galileo Bonaiuti was buried in the same church, the Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence, where about 200 years later, Galileo Galilei was also buried. When he did refer to himself with more than one name, it was sometimes as Galileo Galilei Linceo, a reference to his being a member of the Accademia dei Lincei, an elite pro-science organization in Italy. It was common for mid-sixteenth-century Tuscan families to name the eldest son after the parents' surname. Hence, Galileo Galilei was not necessarily named after his ancestor Galileo Bonaiuti. The Italian male given name \"Galileo\" (and thence the surname \"Galilei\") derives from the Latin \"Galilaeus\", meaning \"of Galilee\", a biblically significant region in Northern Israel. Because of that region, the adjective galilaios (Greek \u0393\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03bb\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2, Latin Galilaeus, Italian Galileo), which means \"Galilean\", was used in antiquity (particularly by emperor Julian) to refer to Christ and his followers. The biblical roots of Galileo's name and surname were to become the subject of a famous pun. In 1614, during the Galileo affair, one of Galileo's opponents, the Dominican priest Tommaso Caccini, delivered against Galileo a controversial and influential sermon. In it he made a point of quoting Acts , \"Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?\" (in the Latin version found in the Vulgate: Viri Galilaei, quid statis aspicientes in caelum?)."

They had two daughters, Virginia (born 1600) and Livia (born 1601), and a son, Vincenzo (born 1606). Due to their illegitimate birth, Galileo considered the girls unmarriageable, if not posing problems of prohibitively expensive support or dowries, which would have been similar to Galileo's previous extensive financial problems with two of his sisters. Their only worthy alternative was the religious life. Both girls were accepted by the convent of San Matteo in Arcetri and remained there for the rest of their lives. Virginia took the name Maria Celeste upon entering the convent. She died on 2 April 1634, and is buried with Galileo at the Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence. Livia took the name Sister Arcangela and was ill for most of her life. Vincenzo was later legitimised as the legal heir of Galileo and married Sestilia Bocchineri."

        "content": "Although Galileo seriously considered the priesthood as a young man, at his father's urging he instead enrolled in 1580 at the University of Pisa for a medical degree. He was influenced by the lectures of Girolamo Borro and Francesco Buonamici of Florence. In 1581, when he was studying medicine, he noticed a swinging chandelier, which air currents shifted about to swing in larger and smaller arcs. To him, it seemed, by comparison with his heartbeat, that the chandelier took the same amount of time to swing back and forth, no matter how far it was swinging. When he returned home, he set up two pendulums of equal length and swung one with a large sweep and the other with a small sweep and found that they kept time together. It was not until the work of Christiaan Huygens, almost one hundred years later, that the tautochrone nature of a swinging pendulum was used to create an accurate timepiece. Up to this point, Galileo had deliberately been kept away from mathematics, since a physician earned a higher income than a mathematician. However, after accidentally attending a lecture on geometry, he talked his reluctant father into letting him study mathematics and natural philosophy instead of medicine. He created a thermoscope, a forerunner of the thermometer, and, in 1586, published a small book on the design of a hydrostatic balance he had invented (which first brought him to the attention of the scholarly world). Galileo also studied disegno, a term encompassing fine art, and, in 1588, obtained the position of instructor in the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno in Florence, teaching perspective and chiaroscuro. In the same year, upon invitation by the Florentine Academy, he presented two lectures, On the Shape, Location, and Size of Dante's Inferno, in an attempt to propose a rigorous cosmological model of Dante's hell. Being inspired by the artistic tradition of the city and the works of the Renaissance artists, Galileo acquired an aesthetic mentality. While a young teacher at the Accademia, he began a lifelong friendship with the Florentine painter Cigoli. In 1589, he was appointed to the chair of mathematics in Pisa. In 1591, his father died, and he was entrusted with the care of his younger brother Michelagnolo. In 1592, he moved to the University of Padua where he taught geometry, mechanics, and astronomy until 1610. During this period, Galileo made significant discoveries in both pure fundamental science (for example, kinematics of motion and astronomy) as well as practical applied science (for example, strength of materials and pioneering the telescope). His multiple interests included the study of astrology, which at the time was a discipline tied to the studies of mathematics and astronomy."

His telescopes were also a profitable sideline for Galileo, who sold them to merchants who found them useful both at sea and as items of trade.

In his study, he also made topographical charts, estimating the heights of the mountains. The Moon was not what was long thought to have been a translucent and perfect sphere, as Aristotle claimed, and hardly the first \"planet\", an \"eternal pearl to magnificently ascend into the heavenly empyrian\", as put forth by Dante. Galileo is sometimes credited with the discovery of the lunar libration in latitude in 1632, although Thomas Harriot or William Gilbert might have done it before. A friend of Galileo's, the painter Cigoli, included a realistic depiction of the Moon in one of his paintings, though probably used his own telescope to make the observation."

        "content": "On 7 January 1610, Galileo observed with his telescope what he described at the time as \"three fixed stars, totally invisible by their smallness\", all close to Jupiter, and lying on a straight line through it. Observations on subsequent nights showed that the positions of these \"stars\" relative to Jupiter were changing in a way that would have been inexplicable if they had really been fixed stars. On 10 January, Galileo noted that one of them had disappeared, an observation which he attributed to its being hidden behind Jupiter. Within a few days, he concluded that they were orbiting Jupiter: he had discovered three of Jupiter's four largest moons. He discovered the fourth on 13 January. Galileo named the group of four the Medicean stars, in honour of his future patron, Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Cosimo's three brothers. Later astronomers, however, renamed them Galilean satellites in honour of their discoverer. These satellites were independently discovered by Simon Marius on 8 January 1610 and are now called Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, the names given by Marius in his Mundus Iovialis published in 1614. Galileo's observations of the satellites of Jupiter caused a revolution in astronomy: a planet with smaller planets orbiting it did not conform to the principles of Aristotelian cosmology, which held that all heavenly bodies should circle the Earth, and many astronomers and philosophers initially refused to believe that Galileo could have discovered such a thing. His observations were confirmed by the observatory of Christopher Clavius and he received a hero's welcome when he visited Rome in 1611. Galileo continued to observe the satellites over the next eighteen months, and by mid-1611, he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods\u2014a feat which Johannes Kepler had believed impossible."

        "content": "From September 1610, Galileo observed that Venus exhibits a full set of phases similar to that of the Moon. The heliocentric model of the Solar System developed by Nicolaus Copernicus predicted that all phases would be visible since the orbit of Venus around the Sun would cause its illuminated hemisphere to face the Earth when it was on the opposite side of the Sun and to face away from the Earth when it was on the Earth-side of the Sun. In Ptolemy's geocentric model, it was impossible for any of the planets' orbits to intersect the spherical shell carrying the Sun. Traditionally, the orbit of Venus was placed entirely on the near side of the Sun, where it could exhibit only crescent and new phases. It was also possible to place it entirely on the far side of the Sun, where it could exhibit only gibbous and full phases. After Galileo's telescopic observations of the crescent, gibbous and full phases of Venus, the Ptolemaic model became untenable. In the early 17th century, as a result of his discovery, the great majority of astronomers converted to one of the various geo-heliocentric planetary models, such as the Tychonic, Capellan and Extended Capellan models, each either with or without a daily rotating Earth. These all explained the phases of Venus without the 'refutation' of full heliocentrism's prediction of stellar parallax. Galileo's discovery of the phases of Venus was thus his most empirically practically influential contribution to the two-stage transition from full geocentrism to full heliocentrism via geo-heliocentrism."

The rings reappeared when he observed the planet in 1616, further confusing him. Galileo observed the planet Neptune in 1612. It appears in his notebooks as one of many unremarkable dim stars. He did not realise that it was a planet, but he did note its motion relative to the stars before losing track of it."

A dispute over claimed priority in the discovery of sunspots, and in their interpretation, led Galileo to a long and bitter feud with the Jesuit Christoph Scheiner.

He located many other stars too distant to be visible with the naked eye. He observed the double star Mizar in Ursa Major in 1617. In the Starry Messenger, Galileo reported that stars appeared as mere blazes of light, essentially unaltered in appearance by the telescope, and contrasted them to planets, which the telescope revealed to be discs. But shortly thereafter, in his Letters on Sunspots, he reported that the telescope revealed the shapes of both stars and planets to be \"quite round\". From that point forward, he continued to report that telescopes showed the roundness of stars, and that stars seen through the telescope measured a few seconds of arc in diameter. He also devised a method for measuring the apparent size of a star without a telescope. As described in his Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, his method was to hang a thin rope in his line of sight to the star and measure the maximum distance from which it would wholly obscure the star. From his measurements of this distance and of the width of the rope, he could calculate the angle subtended by the star at his viewing point. In his Dialogue, he reported that he had found the apparent diameter of a star of first magnitude to be no more than 5 arcseconds, and that of one of sixth magnitude to be about 5/6 arcseconds. Like most astronomers of his day, Galileo did not recognise that the apparent sizes of stars that he measured were spurious, caused by diffraction and atmospheric distortion, and did not represent the true sizes of stars. However, Galileo's values were much smaller than previous estimates of the apparent sizes of the brightest stars, such as those made by Brahe, and enabled Galileo to counter anti-Copernican arguments such as those made by Tycho that these stars would have to be absurdly large for their annual parallaxes to be undetectable. Other astronomers such as Simon Marius, Giovanni Battista Riccioli, and Martinus Hortensius made similar measurements of stars, and Marius and Riccioli concluded the smaller sizes were not small enough to answer Tycho's argument."

Galileo considered his theory of the tides to provide such evidence. This theory was so important to him that he originally intended to call his Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems the Dialogue on the Ebb and Flow of the Sea. The reference to tides was removed from the title by order of the Inquisition. For Galileo, the tides were caused by the sloshing back and forth of water in the seas as a point on the Earth's surface sped up and slowed down because of the Earth's rotation on its axis and revolution around the Sun. He circulated his first account of the tides in 1616, addressed to Cardinal Orsini. His theory gave the first insight into the importance of the shapes of ocean basins in the size and timing of tides; he correctly accounted, for instance, for the negligible tides halfway along the Adriatic Sea compared to those at the ends. As a general account of the cause of tides, however, his theory was a failure. If this theory were correct, there would be only one high tide per day. Galileo and his contemporaries were aware of this inadequacy because there are two daily high tides at Venice instead of one, about 12 hours apart. Galileo dismissed this anomaly as the result of several secondary causes including the shape of the sea, its depth, and other factors. Albert Einstein later expressed the opinion that Galileo developed his \"fascinating arguments\" and accepted them uncritically out of a desire for physical proof of the motion of the Earth. Galileo also dismissed the idea, known from antiquity and by his contemporary Johannes Kepler, that the Moon caused the tides\u2014Galileo also took no interest in Kepler's elliptical orbits of the planets. Galileo continued to argue in favour of his theory of tides, considering it the ultimate proof of Earth's motion."

        "content": "In 1619, Galileo became embroiled in a controversy with Father Orazio Grassi, professor of mathematics at the Jesuit Collegio Romano. It began as a dispute over the nature of comets, but by the time Galileo had published The Assayer (Il Saggiatore) in 1623, his last salvo in the dispute, it had become a much wider controversy over the very nature of science itself. The title page of the book describes Galileo as philosopher and \"Matematico Primario\" of the Grand Duke of Tuscany. Because The Assayer contains such a wealth of Galileo's ideas on how science should be practised, it has been referred to as his scientific manifesto. Early in 1619, Father Grassi had anonymously published a pamphlet, An Astronomical Disputation on the Three Comets of the Year 1618, which discussed the nature of a comet that had appeared late in November of the previous year. Grassi concluded that the comet was a fiery body that had moved along a segment of a great circle at a constant distance from the earth, and since it moved in the sky more slowly than the Moon, it must be farther away than the Moon. Grassi's arguments and conclusions were criticised in a subsequent article, Discourse on Comets, published under the name of one of Galileo's disciples, a Florentine lawyer named Mario Guiducci, although it had been largely written by Galileo himself. Galileo and Guiducci offered no definitive theory of their own on the nature of comets, although they did present some tentative conjectures that are now known to be mistaken. (The correct approach to the study of comets had been proposed at the time by Tycho Brahe.) In its opening passage, Galileo and Guiducci's Discourse gratuitously insulted the Jesuit Christoph Scheiner, and various uncomplimentary remarks about the professors of the Collegio Romano were scattered throughout the work. The Jesuits were offended, and Grassi soon replied with a polemical tract of his own, The Astronomical and Philosophical Balance, under the pseudonym Lothario Sarsio Sigensano, purporting to be one of his own pupils. The Assayer was Galileo's devastating reply to the Astronomical Balance. It has been widely recognized as a masterpiece of polemical literature, in which \"Sarsi's\" arguments are subjected to withering scorn. It was greeted with wide acclaim, and particularly pleased the new pope, Urban VIII, to whom it had been dedicated. In Rome, in the previous decade, Barberini, the future Urban VIII, had come down on the side of Galileo and the Lincean Academy. Galileo's dispute with Grassi permanently alienated many Jesuits, and Galileo and his friends were convinced that they were responsible for bringing about his later condemnation, although supporting evidence for this is not conclusive."

        "title": "Galileo Galilei_Controversy over heliocentrism",
        "content": "At the time of Galileo's conflict with the Church, the majority of educated people subscribed to the Aristotelian geocentric view that the Earth is the center of the Universe and the orbit of all heavenly bodies, or Tycho Brahe's new system blending geocentrism with heliocentrism. Opposition to heliocentrism and Galileo's writings on it combined religious and scientific objections. Religious opposition to heliocentrism arose from biblical passages implying the fixed nature of the Earth. Scientific opposition came from Brahe, who argued that if heliocentrism were true, an annual stellar parallax should be observed, though none was at the time. Aristarchus and Copernicus had correctly postulated that parallax was negligible because the stars were so distant. However, Tycho countered that since stars appear to have measurable angular size, if the stars were that distant and their apparent size is due to their physical size, they would be far larger than the Sun. In fact, it is not possible to observe the physical size of distant stars without modern telescopes. Galileo defended heliocentrism based on his astronomical observations of 1609. In December 1613, the Grand Duchess Christina of Florence confronted one of Galileo's friends and followers, Benedetto Castelli, with biblical objections to the motion of the Earth. Prompted by this incident, Galileo wrote a letter to Castelli in which he argued that heliocentrism was actually not contrary to biblical texts, and that the Bible was an authority on faith and morals, not science. This letter was not published, but circulated widely. Two years later, Galileo wrote a letter to Christina that expanded his arguments previously made in eight pages to forty pages. By 1615, Galileo's writings on heliocentrism had been submitted to the Roman Inquisition by Father Niccol\u00f2 Lorini, who claimed that Galileo and his followers were attempting to reinterpret the Bible, which was seen as a violation of the Council of Trent and looked dangerously like Protestantism. Lorini specifically cited Galileo's letter to Castelli. Galileo went to Rome to defend himself and his ideas. At the start of 1616, Monsignor Francesco Ingoli initiated a debate with Galileo, sending him an essay disputing the Copernican system. Galileo later stated that he believed this essay to have been instrumental in the action against Copernicanism that followed. Ingoli may have been commissioned by the Inquisition to write an expert opinion on the controversy, with the essay providing the basis for the Inquisition's actions. The essay focused on eighteen physical and mathematical arguments against heliocentrism. It borrowed primarily from Tycho Brahe's arguments, notably that heliocentrism would require the stars as they appeared to be much larger than the Sun. The essay also included four theological arguments, but Ingoli suggested Galileo focus on the physical and mathematical arguments, and he did not mention Galileo's biblical ideas. In February 1616, an Inquisitorial commission declared heliocentrism to be \"foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture\". The Inquisition found that the idea of the Earth's movement \"receives the same judgement in philosophy and\u00a0... in regard to theological truth it is at least erroneous in faith\". Pope Paul V instructed Cardinal Bellarmine to deliver this finding to Galileo, and to order him to abandon heliocentrism. On 26 February, Galileo was called to Bellarmine's residence and ordered \"to abandon completely\u00a0... the opinion that the sun stands still at the center of the world and the Earth moves, and henceforth not to hold, teach, or defend it in any way whatever, either orally or in writing.\" The decree of the Congregation of the Index banned Copernicus's De Revolutionibus and other heliocentric works until correction. For the next decade, Galileo stayed well away from the controversy. He revived his project of writing a book on the subject, encouraged by the election of Cardinal Maffeo Barberini as Pope Urban VIII in 1623. Barberini was a friend and admirer of Galileo, and had opposed the admonition of Galileo in 1616. Galileo's resulting book, Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, was published in 1632, with formal authorization from the Inquisition and papal permission. Earlier, Pope Urban VIII had personally asked Galileo to give arguments for and against heliocentrism in the book, and to be careful not to advocate heliocentrism. Whether unknowingly or deliberately, Simplicio, the defender of the Aristotelian geocentric view in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, was often caught in his own errors and sometimes came across as a fool. Indeed, although Galileo states in the preface of his book that the character is named after a famous Aristotelian philosopher (Simplicius in Latin, \"Simplicio\" in Italian), the name \"Simplicio\" in Italian also has the connotation of \"simpleton\". This portrayal of Simplicio made Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems appear as an advocacy book: an attack on Aristotelian geocentrism and defence of the Copernican theory. Most historians agree Galileo did not act out of malice and felt blindsided by the reaction to his book. However, the Pope did not take the suspected public ridicule lightly, nor the Copernican advocacy. Galileo had alienated one of his biggest and most powerful supporters, the Pope, and was called to Rome to defend his writings in September 1632. He finally arrived in February 1633 and was brought before inquisitor Vincenzo Maculani to be charged. Throughout his trial, Galileo steadfastly maintained that since 1616 he had faithfully kept his promise not to hold any of the condemned opinions, and initially he denied even defending them. However, he was eventually persuaded to admit that, contrary to his true intention, a reader of his Dialogue could well have obtained the impression that it was intended to be a defence of Copernicanism. In view of Galileo's rather implausible denial that he had ever held Copernican ideas after 1616 or ever intended to defend them in the Dialogue, his final interrogation, in July 1633, concluded with his being threatened with torture if he did not tell the truth, but he maintained his denial despite the threat. The sentence of the Inquisition was delivered on 22 June. It was in three essential parts: Galileo was found \"vehemently suspect of heresy\" (though he was never formally charged with heresy, relieving him of facing corporal punishment), namely of having held the opinions that the Sun lies motionless at the centre of the universe, that the Earth is not at its centre and moves, and that one may hold and defend an opinion as probable after it has been declared contrary to Holy Scripture. He was required to \"abjure, curse and detest\" those opinions. He was sentenced to formal imprisonment at the pleasure of the Inquisition. On the following day, this was commuted to house arrest, under which he remained for the rest of his life. His offending Dialogue was banned; and in an action not announced at the trial, publication of any of his works was forbidden, including any he might write in the future. According to popular legend, after recanting his theory that the Earth moved around the Sun, Galileo allegedly muttered the rebellious phrase \"And yet it moves\". There was a claim that a 1640s painting by the Spanish painter Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo or an artist of his school, in which the words were hidden until restoration work in 1911, depicts an imprisoned Galileo apparently gazing at the words \"E pur si muove\" written on the wall of his dungeon. The earliest known written account of the legend dates to a century after his death. Based on the painting, Stillman Drake wrote  \"there is no doubt now that the famous words were already attributed to Galileo before his death\". However, an intensive investigation by astrophysicist Mario Livio has revealed that said painting is most probably a copy of a 1837 painting by the Flemish painter Roman-Eugene Van Maldeghem. After a period with the friendly Ascanio Piccolomini (the Archbishop of Siena), Galileo was allowed to return to his villa at Arcetri near Florence in 1634, where he spent part of his life under house arrest. Galileo was ordered to read the Seven Penitential Psalms once a week for the next three years. However, his daughter Maria Celeste relieved him of the burden after securing ecclesiastical permission to take it upon herself. It was while Galileo was under house arrest that he dedicated his time to one of his finest works, Two New Sciences. Here he summarised work he had done some forty years earlier, on the two sciences now called kinematics and strength of materials, published in Holland to avoid the censor. This book was highly praised by Albert Einstein. As a result of this work, Galileo is often called the \"father of modern physics\". He went completely blind in 1638 and was suffering from a painful hernia and insomnia, so he was permitted to travel to Florence for medical advice. Dava Sobel argues that prior to Galileo's 1633 trial and judgement for heresy, Pope Urban VIII had become preoccupied with court intrigue and problems of state and began to fear persecution or threats to his own life. In this context, Sobel argues that the problem of Galileo was presented to the pope by court insiders and enemies of Galileo. Having been accused of weakness in defending the church, Urban reacted against Galileo out of anger and fear. Mario Livio places Galileo and his discoveries in modern scientific and social contexts. In particular, he argues that the Galileo affair has its counterpart in science denial."

The Grand Duke of Tuscany, Ferdinando II, wished to bury him in the main body of the Basilica of Santa Croce, next to the tombs of his father and other ancestors, and to erect a marble mausoleum in his honour. These plans were dropped, however, after Pope Urban VIII and his nephew, Cardinal Francesco Barberini, protested, because Galileo had been condemned by the Catholic Church for \"vehement suspicion of heresy\". He was instead buried in a small room next to the novices' chapel at the end of a corridor from the southern transept of the basilica to the sacristy. He was reburied in the main body of the basilica in 1737 after a monument had been erected there in his honour; during this move, three fingers and a tooth were removed from his remains. These fingers are currently on exhibition at the Museo Galileo in Florence, Italy."

        "content": "Galileo made original contributions to the science of motion through an innovative combination of experiment and mathematics. More typical of science at the time were the qualitative studies of William Gilbert, on magnetism and electricity. Galileo's father, Vincenzo Galilei, a lutenist and music theorist, had performed experiments establishing perhaps the oldest known non-linear relation in physics: for a stretched string, the pitch varies as the square root of the tension. These observations lay within the framework of the Pythagorean tradition of music, well known to instrument makers, which included the fact that subdividing a string by a whole number produces a harmonious scale. Thus, a limited amount of mathematics had long related music and physical science, and young Galileo could see his own father's observations expand on that tradition. Galileo was one of the first modern thinkers to clearly state that the laws of nature are mathematical. In The Assayer, he wrote \"Philosophy is written in this grand book, the universe\u00a0... It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures;....\" His mathematical analyses are a further development of a tradition employed by late scholastic natural philosophers, which Galileo learned when he studied philosophy. His work marked another step towards the eventual separation of science from both philosophy and religion; a major development in human thought. He was often willing to change his views in accordance with observation. In order to perform his experiments, Galileo had to set up standards of length and time, so that measurements made on different days and in different laboratories could be compared in a reproducible fashion. This provided a reliable foundation on which to confirm mathematical laws using inductive reasoning. Galileo showed a modern appreciation for the proper relationship between mathematics, theoretical physics, and experimental physics. He understood the parabola, both in terms of conic sections and in terms of the ordinate (y) varying as the square of the abscissa (x). Galileo further asserted that the parabola was the theoretically ideal trajectory of a uniformly accelerated projectile in the absence of air resistance or other disturbances. He conceded that there are limits to the validity of this theory, noting on theoretical grounds that a projectile trajectory of a size comparable to that of the Earth could not possibly be a parabola, but he nevertheless maintained that for distances up to the range of the artillery of his day, the deviation of a projectile's trajectory from a parabola would be only very slight."

        "content": "Galileo made a number of contributions to what is now known as engineering, as distinct from pure physics. Between 1595 and 1598, Galileo devised and improved a geometric and military compass suitable for use by gunners and surveyors. This expanded on earlier instruments designed by Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia and Guidobaldo del Monte. For gunners, it offered, in addition to a new and safer way of elevating cannons accurately, a way of quickly computing the charge of gunpowder for cannonballs of different sizes and materials. As a geometric instrument, it enabled the construction of any regular polygon, computation of the area of any polygon or circular sector, and a variety of other calculations. Under Galileo's direction, instrument maker Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni produced more than 100 of these compasses, which Galileo sold (along with an instruction manual he wrote) for 50 lire and offered a course of instruction in the use of the compasses for 120 lire. In 1593, Galileo constructed a thermometer, using the expansion and contraction of air in a bulb to move water in an attached tube. In 1609, Galileo was, along with Englishman Thomas Harriot and others, among the first to use a refracting telescope as an instrument to observe stars, planets or moons. The name \"telescope\" was coined for Galileo's instrument by a Greek mathematician, Giovanni Demisiani, at a banquet held in 1611 by Prince Federico Cesi to make Galileo a member of his Accademia dei Lincei. In 1610, he used a telescope at close range to magnify the parts of insects. By 1624, Galileo had used a compound microscope. He gave one of these instruments to Cardinal Zollern in May of that year for presentation to the Duke of Bavaria, and in September, he sent another to Prince Cesi. The Linceans played a role again in naming the \"microscope\" a year later when fellow academy member Giovanni Faber coined the word for Galileo's invention from the Greek words \u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd (micron) meaning \"small\", and \u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd (skopein) meaning \"to look at\". The word was meant to be analogous with \"telescope\". Illustrations of insects made using one of Galileo's microscopes and published in 1625, appear to have been the first clear documentation of the use of a compound microscope. In 1612, having determined the orbital periods of Jupiter's satellites, Galileo proposed that with sufficiently accurate knowledge of their orbits, one could use their positions as a universal clock, and this would make possible the determination of longitude. He worked on this problem from time to time during the remainder of his life, but the practical problems were severe. The method was first successfully applied by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1681 and was later used extensively for large land surveys; this method, for example, was used to survey France, and later by Zebulon Pike of the midwestern United States in 1806. For sea navigation, where delicate telescopic observations were more difficult, the longitude problem eventually required the development of a practical portable marine chronometer, such as that of John Harrison. Late in his life, when totally blind, Galileo designed an escapement mechanism for a pendulum clock (called Galileo's escapement), although no clock using this was built until after the first fully operational pendulum clock was made by Christiaan Huygens in the 1650s. Galileo was invited on several occasions to advise on engineering schemes to alleviate river flooding. In 1630 Mario Guiducci was probably instrumental in ensuring that he was consulted on a scheme by Bartolotti to cut a new channel for the Bisenzio River near Florence."

        "content": "Galileo's theoretical and experimental work on the motions of bodies, along with the largely independent work of Kepler and Ren\u00e9 Descartes, was a precursor of the classical mechanics developed by Sir Isaac Newton. Galileo conducted several experiments with pendulums. It is popularly believed (thanks to the biography by Vincenzo Viviani) that these began by watching the swings of the bronze chandelier in the cathedral of Pisa, using his pulse as a timer. Later experiments are described in his Two New Sciences. Galileo claimed that a simple pendulum is isochronous, i.e. that its swings always take the same amount of time, independently of the amplitude. In fact, this is only approximately true, as was discovered by Christiaan Huygens. Galileo also found that the square of the period varies directly with the length of the pendulum. Galileo's son, Vincenzo, sketched a clock based on his father's theories in 1642. The clock was never built and, because of the large swings required by its verge escapement, would have been a poor timekeeper. Galileo is lesser known for, yet still credited with, being one of the first to understand sound frequency. By scraping a chisel at different speeds, he linked the pitch of the sound produced to the spacing of the chisel's skips, a measure of frequency. In 1638, Galileo described an experimental method to measure the speed of light by arranging that two observers, each having lanterns equipped with shutters, observe each other's lanterns at some distance. The first observer opens the shutter of his lamp, and, the second, upon seeing the light, immediately opens the shutter of his own lantern. The time between the first observer's opening his shutter and seeing the light from the second observer's lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers. Galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile, he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously. Sometime between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of the Florentine Accademia del Cimento repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result. The speed of light has since been determined to be far too fast to be measured by such methods. Galileo put forward the basic principle of relativity, that the laws of physics are the same in any system that is moving at a constant speed in a straight line, regardless of its particular speed or direction. Hence, there is no absolute motion or absolute rest. This principle provided the basic framework for Newton's laws of motion and is central to Einstein's special theory of relativity."

        "title": "Galileo Galilei_Falling bodies",
        "content": "A biography by Galileo's pupil Vincenzo Viviani stated that Galileo had dropped balls of the same material, but different masses, from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass. This was contrary to what Aristotle had taught: that heavy objects fall faster than lighter ones, in direct proportion to weight. While this story has been retold in popular accounts, there is no account by Galileo himself of such an experiment, and it is generally accepted by historians that it was at most a thought experiment which did not actually take place. An exception is Drake, who argues that the experiment did take place, more or less as Viviani described it. The experiment described was actually performed by Simon Stevin (commonly known as Stevinus) and Jan Cornets de Groot, although the building used was actually the church tower in Delft in 1586. However, most of his experiments with falling bodies were carried out using inclined planes where both the issues of timing and air resistance were much reduced. In any case, observations that similarly sized objects of different weights fell at the same speed is documented in works as early as those of John Philoponus in the sixth century and which Galileo was aware of. In his 1638 Discorsi, Galileo's character Salviati, widely regarded as Galileo's spokesman, held that all unequal weights would fall with the same finite speed in a vacuum. But this had previously been proposed by Lucretius and Simon Stevin. Cristiano Banti's Salviati also held it could be experimentally demonstrated by the comparison of pendulum motions in air with bobs of lead and of cork which had different weight but which were otherwise similar. Galileo proposed that a falling body would fall with a uniform acceleration, as long as the resistance of the medium through which it was falling remained negligible, or in the limiting case of its falling through a vacuum. He also derived the correct kinematical law for the distance travelled during a uniform acceleration starting from rest\u2014namely, that it is proportional to the square of the elapsed time (d\u221dt2). Prior to Galileo, Nicole Oresme, in the 14th century, had derived the times-squared law for uniformly accelerated change, and Domingo de Soto had suggested in the 16th century that bodies falling through a homogeneous medium would be uniformly accelerated. Soto, however, did not anticipate many of the qualifications and refinements contained in Galileo's theory of falling bodies. He did not, for instance, recognise, as Galileo did, that a body would fall with a strictly uniform acceleration only in a vacuum, and that it would otherwise eventually reach a uniform terminal velocity. Galileo expressed the time-squared law using geometrical constructions and mathematically precise words, adhering to the standards of the day. (It remained for others to re-express the law in algebraic terms.) He also concluded that objects retain their velocity in the absence of any impediments to their motion, thereby contradicting the generally accepted Aristotelian hypothesis that a body could only remain in so-called \"violent\", \"unnatural\", or \"forced\" motion so long as an agent of change (the \"mover\") continued to act on it. Philosophical ideas relating to inertia had been proposed by John Philoponus and Jean Buridan. Galileo stated: \"Imagine any particle projected along a horizontal plane without friction; then we know, from what has been more fully explained in the preceding pages, that this particle will move along this same plane with a motion which is uniform and perpetual, provided the plane has no limits\". But the surface of the earth would be an instance of such a plane if all its unevenness could be removed. This was incorporated into Newton's laws of motion (first law), except for the direction of the motion: Newton's is straight, Galileo's is circular (for example, the planets' motion around the Sun, which according to him, and unlike Newton, takes place in absence of gravity). According to Dijksterhuis Galileo's conception of inertia as a tendency to persevere in circular motion is closely related to his Copernican conviction."

The analysis and proofs relied heavily on the Eudoxian theory of proportion, as set forth in the fifth book of Euclid's Elements. This theory had become available only a century before, thanks to accurate translations by Tartaglia and others; but by the end of Galileo's life, it was being superseded by the algebraic methods of Descartes.  The concept now named Galileo's paradox was not original with him. His proposed solution, that infinite numbers cannot be compared, is no longer considered useful."

The Inquisition's ban on reprinting Galileo's works was lifted in 1718 when permission was granted to publish an edition of his works (excluding the condemned Dialogue) in Florence. In 1741, Pope Benedict XIV authorised the publication of an edition of Galileo's complete scientific works which included a mildly censored version of the Dialogue. In 1758, the general prohibition against works advocating heliocentrism was removed from the Index of prohibited books, although the specific ban on uncensored versions of the Dialogue and Copernicus's De Revolutionibus remained. All traces of official opposition to heliocentrism by the church disappeared in 1835 when these works were finally dropped from the Index. Interest in the Galileo affair was revived in the early 19th century, when Protestant polemicists used it (and other events such as the Spanish Inquisition and the myth of the flat Earth) to attack Roman Catholicism. Interest in it has waxed and waned ever since. In 1939, Pope Pius XII, in his first speech to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, within a few months of his election to the papacy, described Galileo as being among the \"most audacious heroes of research... not afraid of the stumbling blocks and the risks on the way, nor fearful of the funereal monuments\". His close advisor of 40 years, Professor Robert Leiber, wrote: \"Pius XII was very careful not to close any doors (to science) prematurely. He was energetic on this point and regretted that in the case of Galileo.\" On 15 February 1990, in a speech delivered at the Sapienza University of Rome, Cardinal Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) cited some current views on the Galileo affair as forming what he called \"a symptomatic case that permits us to see how deep the self-doubt of the modern age, of science and technology goes today\". Some of the views he cited were those of the philosopher Paul Feyerabend, whom he quoted as saying: \"The Church at the time of Galileo kept much more closely to reason than did Galileo himself, and she took into consideration the ethical and social consequences of Galileo's teaching too. Her verdict against Galileo was rational and just and the revision of this verdict can be justified only on the grounds of what is politically opportune.\" The Cardinal did not clearly indicate whether he agreed or disagreed with Feyerabend's assertions. He did, however, say: \"It would be foolish to construct an impulsive apologetic on the basis of such views.\" On 31 October 1992, Pope John Paul II acknowledged that the Church had erred in condemning Galileo for asserting that the Earth revolves around the Sun. \"John Paul said the theologians who condemned Galileo did not recognize the formal distinction between the Bible and its interpretation.\" In March 2008, the head of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Nicola Cabibbo, announced a plan to honour Galileo by erecting a statue of him inside the Vatican walls. In December of the same year, during events to mark the 400th anniversary of Galileo's earliest telescopic observations, Pope Benedict XVI praised his contributions to astronomy. A month later, however, the head of the Pontifical Council for Culture, Gianfranco Ravasi, revealed that the plan to erect a statue of Galileo on the grounds of the Vatican had been suspended."

The Letters on Sunspots also reported his 1610 telescopic observations of the full set of phases of Venus, and his discovery of the puzzling \"appendages\" of Saturn and their even more puzzling subsequent disappearance. In 1615, Galileo prepared a manuscript known as the \"Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina\" which was not published in printed form until 1636. This letter was a revised version of the Letter to Castelli, which was denounced by the Inquisition as an incursion upon theology by advocating Copernicanism both as physically true and as consistent with Scripture. In 1616, after the order by the Inquisition for Galileo not to hold or defend the Copernican position, Galileo wrote the \"Discourse on the Tides\" (Discorso sul flusso e il reflusso del mare) based on the Copernican earth, in the form of a private letter to Cardinal Orsini. In 1619, Mario Guiducci, a pupil of Galileo's, published a lecture written largely by Galileo under the title Discourse on the Comets (Discorso Delle Comete), arguing against the Jesuit interpretation of comets. In 1623, Galileo published The Assayer\u2014Il Saggiatore, which attacked theories based on Aristotle's authority and promoted experimentation and the mathematical formulation of scientific ideas. The book was highly successful and even found support among the higher echelons of the Christian church. Following the success of The Assayer, Galileo published the Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo) in 1632. Despite taking care to adhere to the Inquisition's 1616 instructions, the claims in the book favouring Copernican theory and a non-geocentric model of the solar system led to Galileo being tried and banned on publication. Despite the publication ban, Galileo published his Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences (Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche, intorno a due nuove scienze) in 1638 in Holland, outside the jurisdiction of the Inquisition."

        "content": "In the last years of his life, Galileo Galilei kept a library of at least 598 volumes (560 of which have been identified) at Villa Il Gioiello, on the outskirts of Florence. Under the restrictions of house arrest, he was forbidden to write or publish his ideas. However, he continued to received visitors right up to his death and it was through them that he remained supplied with the latest scientific texts from Northern Europe. With his past experience, Galileo may have feared that his collection of books and manuscripts would be seized by the authorities and burned, as no reference to such items was made in his last will and testament. An itemized inventory was only later produced after Galileo's death, when the majority of his possessions including his library passed to his son, Vincenzo Galilei, Jr. On his death in 1649, the collection was inherited by his wife Sestilia Bocchineri. Galileo's books, personal papers and unedited manuscripts were then collected by Vincenzo Viviani, his former assistant and student, with the intent of preserving his old teacher's works in published form. Unfortunately, it was a project that never materialised and in his final will, Viviani bequeathed a significant portion of the collection to the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence, where there already existed an extensive library. The value of Galileo's possessions were not realised, and duplicate copies were dispersed to other libraries, such as the Biblioteca Comunale degli Intronati, the public library in Sienna. In a later attempt to specialise the library's holdings, volumes unrelated to medicine were transferred to the Biblioteca Magliabechiana, an early foundation for what was to become the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze, the National Central Library in Florence. A small portion of Viviani's collection, including the manuscripts of Galileo and those of his peers Evangelista Torricelli and Benedetto Castelli, were left to his nephew, Abbot Jacopo Panzanini. This minor collection was preserved until Panzanini's death when it passed to his great-nephews, Carlo and Angelo Panzanini. The books from both Galileo and Viviani's collection began to disperse as the heirs failed to protect their inheritance. Their servants sold several of the volumes for waste paper. Around 1750 the Florentine senator Giovanni Battista Clemente de'Nelli heard of this and purchased the books and manuscripts from the shopkeepers, and the remainder of Viviani's collection from the Panzanini brothers. As recounted in Nelli's memoirs: \"My great fortune in obtaining such a wonderful treasure so cheaply came about through the ignorance of the people selling it, who were not aware of the value of those manuscripts...\" The library remained in Nelli's care until his death in 1793. Knowing the value of their father's collected manuscripts, Nelli's sons attempted to sell what was left to them to the French government. Grand Duke Ferdinand III of Tuscany intervened in the sale and purchased the entire collection. The archive of manuscripts, printed books and personal papers were deposited with the Biblioteca Palatina in Florence, merging the collection with the Biblioteca Magliabechiana in 1861."

Mellie, newly married to Toni, an airline navigator who is away at work, sees a strange man get off a bus. In a shop trying on a dress to wear to a wedding next day, she sees the man spying on her. When she goes home, he sneaks into the house, ties her up and rapes her. Realising after she has freed herself that he is still in the house, she gets out a shotgun and kills him. Then she drives the body to a cliff and tips it into the sea, saying nothing to her jealous husband when he returns. Next day at the wedding an uninvited American called Dobbs speaks to her. A body has been found and he claims she killed him, which she denies. The day after that, when her husband is away again, Dobbs sneaks into their house and questions Mellie roughly. She begins to think that the rapist had business with Toni, possibly drug related, and that is why Dobbs is so persistent. She goes with him to the bank and, drawing out all she has, offers it to him. But he doesn't want money, just the truth. Next morning Mellie finds the rapist's travel bag, containing 60,000 US dollars. Sneaking into Dobbs' hotel room, she searches it and discovers that he is a US Army colonel on a secret mission. He turns up and tells her a woman who works at a restaurant in Paris has been arrested for the murder. Distraught that an innocent woman is being charged, Mellie jumps onto a plane to Paris and goes to the restaurant, who send her to where the woman's sister works. This proves to be a brothel, where three criminals question Mellie roughly about the dead man. Dobbs, who has been trailing her, breaks in and saves her. Taking her home, Dobbs reveals that the corpse is not that of the rapist but another man's. The rapist was an escapee from a US military prison who had attacked three women in similar fashion before Mellie. She then tells him where she tipped the body, which is found by police frogmen. For Dobbs the case is closed and he does not tell the police about Mellie. Nor does he mention the 60,000 dollars. In a closing homage to Alfred Hitchcock, it is revealed that the rapist's name was Mac Guffin."

Aravindan. A mythological film, its story was adapted from C. N. Sreekantan Nair's play of the same name, which is a reworking of Valmiki's Ramayana. The film interprets a story from the Uttara Kanda of the epic poem Ramayana, where Rama sends his wife, Sita, to the jungle to satisfy his subjects. Sita is never actually seen in the film, but her virtual presence is compellingly evoked in the moods of the forest and the elements. The film retells the epic from a feminist perspective. It was shot in the interior tribal areas of Andhra Pradesh. The roles of the epic heroes are played by Rama Chenchu tribal people, who claim lineage to the mythological Rama. Director Aravindan interweaves the Samkhya-Yoga philosophical concepts of Prakriti-Purusha bonds throughout the film. The film was produced by K. Ravindran Nair under the banner of General Pictures. The film features an original score by classical musician Rajeev Taranath, cinematography by cinematographer-turned-director Shaji N. Karun, editing by Ramesan, and art direction by Artist Namboothiri. The film became a major critical success upon its release in 1977, although a few mainstream critics panned it. It is credited with being at the forefront of a trend towards independent filmmaking in South India. The film earned Aravindan the National Film Award for Best Direction."

Rama and Lakshmana return to Ayodhya to face Urmila, the spirited wife of Lakshmana. Rama replies to her reproaches for abandoning Sita in the Dandakaranya forests, through which they have just journeyed, that the husband of Sita is only a servant of the people of Ayodhya. The next day, Vasishta arrives to suggest that Rama perform the Ashvamedha yaga (the ritual sacrifice of a horse to Agni, the god of fire) but Rama cannot do without his wife by his side. He is averse to taking a second wife, as Vasishta further suggests. The anguish of Rama at this point is juxtaposed with the people of Ayodhya joyously celebrating the harvest. Bharata, a brother of Rama who had left Ayodhya twelve years ago, returns. He objects to Rama performing the yaga without Sita. Their argument almost culminates in a physical fight, but nature intervenes; the skies open and a cooling rain pours down upon them. The yaga begins, with Lakshmana accompanying the horse. The horse strays into Valmiki's ashram (hermitage), where Rama's son Lava and Kusha are being brought up. Lava stops the horse and is ready to fight Lakshmana (as the yaga demands). Lakshmana orders that the horse be released, but once again nature takes a hand. Valmiki is strangely moved by what he sees, and he begins to compose the Uttara Rama Charita \u2013 the story of Rama. The horse is led back to Ayodhya, and the ritualistic second stage of the yaga starts. Just then Rama receives the news that Shambuka has resumed his penance, and Lakshmana is despatched to slay the erring shudra. As the ceremony nears completion, Valmiki arrives with Lava and Kusha, but Vasishta debars Valmiki from entering the yagashala. Rama recognises Lava and Kusha as his sons, and takes them to his heart. The joy of Sita, then, is represented in the glorious splendour of nature."

        "content": "The Samkhya-Yoga philosophical concepts of Prakriti-Purusha bonds are used in the film. Prakriti and Purusha, as philosophical concepts, have their genealogy in the Samkhya-Yoga school of Indian philosophy. In Samkhya thought, Purusha is the Transcendental Self or Pure Consciousness. It is absolute, independent, free, imperceptible, unknowable, above any experience, and beyond any words or explanation. It remains pure, nonattributive consciousness. Purusha is neither produced nor does it produce. Unlike Advaita Vedanta and like Purva-Mimamsa, Samkhya philosophy emphasises the plurality of the Purushas. Prakriti is the first cause of the universe \u2013 of everything except the Purusha, which is uncaused, and accounts for whatever is physical, both matter and force. Through its threefold gunas or characteristics of the physical universe, Prakriti binds Purusha, the self (in the minimal sense of awareness or sentience), which itself is not distinct from Prakriti. A written commentary that throws light on Aravindan's interpretation of the play precedes his film proper. The opening scroll reads, \"This film is an interpretation of the Uttara Kanda of the Ramayana. Our mythologies and the epics are constantly re-created in retellings. The epic is the basis for this visual interpretation as well. This film deviates from established norms in how it visualises the protagonists and portrays the course of events in the epic.\" The scroll explains that the film will try to reflect what it calls the epic's adi-sankalpam (original conception) of the theme and the protagonists. It states that \"the inner essence of the film is that woman is Prakriti. Ultimately Purusha, here conceived of as the masculine self, dissolves into Prakriti. Ezhuthachan's Adhyathma Ramayana, one of the first Malayalam poems, also views Rama as Purusha and Sita as Prakriti. Aravindan stated in an interview that \"C. N. [Sreekantan Nair] had made clear the prakriti-purusha notion in Ramayana\". But Aravindan took the extraordinary cinematic step of representing Sita as Prakriti."

        "content": "Malayalam playwright C. N. Sreekantan Nair wrote his magnum opus play Kanchana Sita in 1961. He took the inspiration for this play from the Uttara Kanda (k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da: chapter) of Ramayana. Uttara Kanda is the seventh and last book of Ramayana. It concerns the final years of Rama, Sita, and Rama's brothers, and is regarded to be a later addition to Valmiki's original story. The play is the first of Sreekantan Nair's dramatic trilogy based on the Ramayana. The others are Saketham and Lankalakshmi. A reworking of Ramayana, the play is about the tragedy of power and the sacrifices demanded by adherence to dharma, including abandoning a chaste wife. Kanchana Sita was developed by Aravindan, based on the play. The screenplay and dialogues of the film were written by Aravindan himself. The film is conceived differently from both Nair's play and the original  Uttara Kanda of Ramayana. If the Uttara Kanda'''s critique of sovereign power is buried in the karmic webs of Rama's life, Nair's play carries a sharply materialistic edge in its critique of Kshatriya-Brahminical power. In contrast with both, Aravindan's thematic content is much more directly focused on Rama's inner conflict between moksha (the desire for enlightenment) and artha (the desire for sovereign power). Sita does not appear in the film at all, but is depicted as prakriti, or all-pervading nature, and the different moods of Sita are shown as different aspects of nature. Nair rewrote the final section of Valmiki's Ramayana as a critique of brahminical privilege and political repression. Using Nair's play only a starting point, Aravindan transformed the script according to his interpretation of Indian philosophy and his minimalist aesthetic. He replaced Nair's crisply-articulated exchanges of dialogue with a cinematic meditation on Rama's separation from, and eventual union with Sita, thus carrying the concept of Sita as Prakriti to its visual limit."

        "content": "The play's main feature is its very eloquent, long, and authoritative dialogues, whereas the film is almost silent. Aravindan explains: \"There are some specific reasons for deciding to have sparse dialogues in Kanchana Sita. One, this episode taken from Ramayana is familiar to all. Two, Ramayana is not a supernatural reality for us, as it is ingrained in us. It is therefore not necessary to educate people about the film through lengthy dialogues. C. N. [Sreekantan Nair] had made clear the prakriti-purusha notion in Ramayana. I did not think that Sita should come in the film in the form of a woman. That is why Sita appeared in the film as prakriti and Prakriti is a character in the film. When the emotions of Sita like pain, sadness, joy, and equanimity are manifested through the moods of Prakriti, dialogue becomes redundant. I felt I could make the film without dialogue. Rama committing suicide \u2013 (I still feel it was \u2013 self immolation) had haunted me very badly. With all these, my Kanchana Sita became very different. Words were required only for very essentials. The dialogues, which I used, were from C. N. [Sreekantan Nair]'s play. The doubt I had then was whether my Rama and Lakshmana (as they were ordinary people) could use such an eloquent Sanskritised language.\", p.38 In another interview, he said, \"Dialogues are there to carry on the storyline and make it move. But when it comes to well-known stories, dialogues ceases to be an essential ingredient.\" Dialogue was, however, included in Kanchana Sita at the end of the movie to discuss the responsibilities of the king."

        "content": "The film significantly differs from all other adaptations of Ramayana in the characterisation of the central characters, including Rama and Lakshmana. The characters are humanised, contrary to the way divine characters from Indian mythology are usually depicted in visual media. Rama has a pot belly, while Lakshmana has pockmarks on his face. In an interview, Aravindan stated, \"Our sculptures are large in size and exude strength and vitality, which is absent in murals. The Rama of Kanchana Sita exudes the strength and vitality of our sculptures. He is not just a plain frontal image. The wandering tribals we encounter here and there with their medicines also share this quality. I enquired and found that these people are settled in villages near the Godavari River. Apart from this they also believe that they belong to the same race. That is why I cast two of them in my film.\" Similarly, Aravindan deliberately did not give a superhuman quality to Rama and Lakshmana. Only when they interact with Nature do they rise to the levels of God and go beyond the ordinary. In Aravindan's own words, \"otherwise they would have been the same as anybody else.\" Diametrically opposed to this, Valmiki is given an appropriate form and beauty."

        "content": "In Kanchana Sita, the roles of the epic heroes like are played by Adivasis (tribal members) from Andhra Pradesh known as the Rama Chenchus (also known as Koyas), who claim that they are the descendants of the Ikshvaku clan, to which Rama belonged. Aravindan's idea was not to use conventional actors, but to find people who had reached the state of awareness that the role required. Rama Chenchu healers play the central roles of Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, Lava, and Kusha. Shambukha was played by a wayside tapasvi, while a destitute woman acted in the role of his wife. The credited cast of the film includes Ramdas, Venkateswarlu, Chinna Pulliah, Kesava Panicker, Krishnan, Pottiah, Rangiah, Siva, Sobha Kiran, and Annapurna., p.90 The name of each village chief is Ramdas. The tribal who acted as Rama is also a village chief. Valmiki's character was played by poet and dramatist Kavalam Narayana Panicker's brother Kesava Panicker. Director John Abraham gave voice for this character. When asked how he got the idea to use tribals for the film, Aravindan said, \"These tribals come to Trivandrum to sell herbal medicine. They are extremely intelligent. In fact, the tribals inhabiting the nine villages around the Godavari river in Andhra are supposed to have the highest I.Q. among Indian tribals. The tribe I selected is known as the Rama Chenchus. They claim to belong to the dynasty of Rama. Physically, I feel, they fit the description given by Valmiki.\" This experiment in casting resulted in several difficulties during production. A precise detailing had to be done because most of the actors could only react to demonstrated instructions. Communication with the actors was carried out with the help of Manmohan Dutt, painter and lecturer at the College of Fine Arts, Hyderabad. Dutt also accompanied Aravindan and his associate, journalist and filmmaker Chintha Ravi, on a preliminary trip to Andhra Pradesh to finalise the locations."

Aravindan abandoned the typical alternation in setting of mythological films and dance dramas, including Sreekantan Nair's play, by moving Rama's story into the landscape Adivasis, imagining Ayodhya in the forest. Its places are forest caves, its streets are tracks in the wilderness, and its Sarayu river is the Godavari river winding through rural Andhra Pradesh. Aravindan identified locations  away from Rajahmundry, along the expanse of Godavari river and its ribbed red earth banks. Cinematographer-turned-director Shaji N. Karun wields the camera. Karun has been a recurring collaborator in Aravindan's films. He was assisted by popular cinematographer S. Kumar who was in his early days of career. Filming took place at the time when the Emergency was declared in India. Police were combing the entire area around Rajamundhry in their hunt for the Maoist People's War Group. Members of the production team were interrogated by the police several times because they looked different from the natives. The film was completed using simple devices such as table fans to rustle the leaves. A few unexpected things happened for the good while shooting the climax scene. For instance, a rare and unexpected early morning mist on the banks of Godavari made the whole scene ethereal."

        "content": "The film received mixed reviews from critics, but is widely regarded as a landmark film in Indian cinema history. It is credited with the formation of a new trend towards independent filmmaking in South India., p.395 The Hindu described Kanchana Sita as one of the most poetic films in Malayalam. Scholar V. Rajakrishnan noted that Aravindan had not fully considered the implications of locating Rama's story in an Adivasi community. Rajakrishnan pointed out that the rigid economy of expression and the subdued acting styles, which appear to render all dialogue artificial, reduce the element of human drama that is so prominent in Sreekantan Nair's play. Poet and scholar Ayyappa Panicker views Sita's absence as typical of Aravindan's style, in which there is a conscious, meticulous effort \"not to communicate in order to communicate\". Panicker described Aravindan's expressive style using his own concept of antarasannivesa, or the poetics of interiorisation. \"Sita is not a woman, or an individual, but an eternal concept in the film\", Panicker said in an interview. The Hindu critic Sashi Kumar stated, \"In the film, Aravindan synthesises into a consummate whole his marginality principle and his anthropomorphic contemplation of nature.\" Vidyarthy Chatterjee of The Economic Times said, \"Visually stunning in many passages and using sound in such a manner as to make for heightened aesthetic pleasure, Kanchana Sita is a milestone that has unfortunately been bypassed by many who would have done better to focus on its innovative elements\". Yves Thoraval said, \"Kanchana Sita is a visually dazzling film illustrating this long mythological episode potentially rich in dialogue but of which G. Aravindan has chosen to make a non-realist, virtually silent and contemplative film by calling up a tribal population to portray the mythological characters\". The National Film Award for Best Direction was given to Aravindan for \"the film's courageous and uncompromising exploration of an ancient epic theme through a pronouncedly new cinematic language, for making the camera speak more eloquently than the introspective characters of the Ramayana'', for projecting against the vast backdrop of nature, for matching profound philosophical ideas with astonishing evocations of the beauties of the physical world\"."

Unniyarcha is portrayed as the embodiment of all virtues. The film also narrates how jealousy takes its roots in the mind of Chanthu,  and how he grows hostile to Aromal, consequently betraying him during a duel. Chanthu was always attracted to Unniyarcha, who always hated him for his cheating behavior. Unniyarcha marries Kunjiraman in spite of Chanthu's objection. Chanthu leaves Puthuram Tharavadu and goes to Tulunadu. Now Aromal has to fight with Aringodar, who is an experienced fighter. Aromal's father, Kannappan Chekavar, calls back Chanthu as second for Aromal for the fight even though it was objected to by Aromal and Unniyarcha. Aringodar encourages Chanthu to make a defective sword for Aromal. During the fight between Aromal and Aringodar, the sword of Aromal breaks into two pieces. Aromal requests Chanthu to give his sword, but Chanthu lies that he has not taken one. Then Aromal throws the broken sword piece at Aringodar, which cuts his head off. Now at Puthuram Tharavadu, everyone sees a fatally wounded Aromal come out of the palanquin and tells that Chanthu had cheated by stabbing him while sleeping. Unniyarcha then pledges to take revenge for this betrayal; and till then, she never ties her hair.

Kannappan Chekavar first refuses Aromalunni and Kanapanunni to go for revenge, fearing Chanthu is skilled in the eighteen techniques of kalari. He teaches them the 19th secret technique. Chanthu finally gets ready to fight with the sons of Puthuram Tharavadu. Finally, after a long fight, Aromalunni tells the 19th secret technique of the kalari he is going to fight.

The picture seems to be a real Gish family affair, with Dorothy starring and Lillian directing. Much is made of the latter in a title leader, which sets forth that this day is one where woman is asserting herself in all the arts, and therefore it is time she undertook the direction of pictures. But Lillian does not qualify as a particularly strong directress in this production. The story may have had something to do with that. It is not a world beater but with the action that Dorothy supplies it gets by with laughs. James Rennie, who plays opposite the star, is the only member of the supporting cast who seems to have more than a \u2018bit\u2019 to do. The others while acceptable fail to show often enough to get a line on them. It is a picture that is Dorothy Gish, hook, line and sinker, and it would sink if it weren\u2019t for her."

The narrator focuses on the emotional qualities of the objects, and discusses the perception of African sculptures from a historical and contemporary European perspective. Only occasionally does the film provide the geographical origin, time period or other contextual information about the objects. The idea of a dead statue is explained as a statue which has lost its original significance and become reduced to a museum object, similarly to a dead person who can be found in history books. Interweaved with the objects are a few scenes of Africans performing traditional music and dances, as well as the death of a disemboweled gorilla. During the last third of the film, the modern commercialisation of African culture is problematised. The film argues that colonial presence has compelled African art to lose much of its idiosyncratic expression, in order to appeal to Western consumers. A mention is made of how African currencies previously had been replaced by European. In the final segment, the film comments on the position of black Africans themselves in contemporary Europe and North America. Footage is seen from a Harlem Globetrotters basketball show, of the boxer Sugar Ray Robinson, and a jazz drummer intercut with scenes from a confrontation between police and labour demonstrators. Lastly the narrator argues that we should regard African and European art history as one inseparable human culture."

She notes how the objects in Statues Also Die are shown almost as if they were alive: \"Marker's camera treats all subjects in front of its lens without differentiating between humans, statues, animals, landscapes, architecture, or signs. The magic of cinema both imbues  inanimate objects with life and carries out the mortification of living subjects,\" something she also connects to the footage of the dying gorilla.

According to Resnais, the original intent was not to make an anticolonial film, but only a film about African art. However when the filmmakers started to do research, they were struck by the fact that African art was exhibited at the ethnological Mus\u00e9e de l'Homme, and not the Louvre like art from elsewhere.

The film stars Sudeep, Nani and Samantha. M. M. Keeravani composed the soundtrack and score. K. K. Senthil Kumar was the director of photography and Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao edited the film. Janardhana Maharshi and Crazy Mohan wrote the dialogue for the Telugu and Tamil versions, respectively. The film's narrative is in the form of a bedtime story told by a father to his daughter. Its protagonist Nani, who is in love with his neighbour Bindu, is murdered by a wealthy industrialist named Sudeep, who is attracted to Bindu and considers Nani a rival. Nani reincarnates as a housefly and tries to avenge his death and protect Bindu from an obsessive Sudeep. The idea for the film originated in the 1990s from a conversation in which Prasad joked with Rajamouli about the idea of a fly seeking revenge against a human. Rajamouli reconsidered the idea after finishing Maryada Ramanna (2010), and Prasad developed it into a script. The film's production began on 7 December 2010 at Ramanaidu Studios in Hyderabad.

The performances of the cast, Rajamouli's direction, and visual effects received critical acclaim upon release. Eega was one of the highest-grossing Telugu films of the year, earning more than 1.25\u00a0billion. Eega won two National Film Awards (Best Feature Film in Telugu and Best Special Effects), five South Filmfare Awards including Best Telugu Film, Best Telugu Director, Best Telugu Actress (Samantha) and Best Telugu Supporting Actor (Sudeep) and three South Indian International Movie Awards.

Nani is a young man based in Hyderabad who specialises in preparing fireworks. He is in love with his neighbour Bindu, a miniature artist who runs Project 511, a non-governmental organisation (NGO). Bindu also develops romantic feelings for Nani though she does not express them. Seeking to raise money for her NGO, Bindu visits the office of a rich and powerful industrialist named Sudeep, who also finds her attractive. He befriends her, donates 1.5\u00a0million (US$ thousand), and gains her trust. Sudeep sees Nani as a rival and plans to kill him. One night, Nani helps Bindu to finish a piece of micro art\u2014a locket made from a pencil. While returning home, Sudeep kidnaps and strangles Nani to death, making his death look like an accident. Unaware of the incident, Bindu proposes to the dying Nani by phone; it is the last thing Nani hears before he is reincarnated as a housefly that cannot remember its previous life. The fly's memory is triggered when it encounters Sudeep and Bindu, and begins to devote itself to exacting revenge on Sudeep. Sudeep asks the heartbroken Bindu to accompany him to New Delhi to meet the education minister; if she can impress the minister with a presentation about the NGO, he might help it gain national recognition. The fly causes Sudeep to have an accident on his way to the airport and writes \"I will kill you\" on the windshield; this makes Sudeep paranoid. The fly, who sees Bindu mourning Nani's death in her bedroom, reveals itself to be Nani by writing on the desk with her tears. It conveys the circumstances of Nani's death to Bindu, and they join forces against Sudeep. The latter's obsession with the fly affects his professional and personal life. In a chain of events, his money is burnt to ashes, leaving him almost penniless. Sudeep learns from a sorcerer that Nani is reincarnated as a fly and seeks revenge. Sudeep arranges to kill Nani at his home, but the fly escapes after causing a short circuit and a fire, which locks up the room. The sorcerer is killed in an accident and Sudeep is left unconscious from the smoke. Nani and Bindu assume Sudeep is dead, but he is saved by his business partner. Sudeep is enraged when he learns that Bindu is helping the fly. Sudeep kills his business partner to collect a 7\u00a0billion (US$ million) insurance policy, as well as to prevent his investors from taking action against his company. Sudeep takes Bindu to his home to interrogate her, and Nani follows them. Bindu, after attempting to stab Sudeep with a razor blade, has her life threatened as Sudeep demands Nani to appear. During the encounter however, Nani seriously injures Sudeep with a needle. After an intensive fight, the latter clips Nani's wing before fatally stabbing him with the same needle. Knowing that he is dying, in a last-ditch attempt to destroy Sudeep, Nani coats himself with gunpowder and jumps through the flame of a burning match and into a previously loaded cannon. The projectile passes through Sudeep and hits an oxygen cylinder, causing a fierce explosion in which Sudeep dies and his entire house burns down. A grieving Bindu (who hid from the inferno unscathed), pines for Nani and takes his wing and makes an amulet with it. One day when travelling to work, an eve teaser bothers her; Nani, again reborn as a fly, attacks him with a needle before announcing his return. The young girl is impressed with the story of the fly her father narrates."

Sudeep drew inspiration for his role as the villain from the 1983 Kannada film Bhakta Prahlada; he was portraying a character he considered to be a \"bad guy\" with \"grey shades\" rather than an antagonist. The script was doctored by Rajamouli's brother, S. S. Kanchi, while Janardhan Maharshi and Crazy Mohan wrote the dialogue for the Telugu and Tamil versions respectively, marking their first collaboration with Rajamouli. James Fowlds was initially chosen as the film's director of photography, but was replaced by K. K. Senthil Kumar due to creative differences and scheduling conflicts. M. M. Keeravani composed the film's soundtrack and score, Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao edited the film, Ravinder Reddy was its art director, and Rajamouli's wife Rama worked on the costume design. Production of the film began with a formal launch ceremony on 7 December 2010 in Hyderabad. The original version was filmed over a six-month period and cost nearly 110\u00a0million; Rajamouli felt the quality of the material was poor and started again. The film's final budget was estimated at between 260 and 400\u00a0million."

        "content": "Principal photography began on 22 February 2011 in Hyderabad; ninety percent of the film was shot at Ramanaidu Studios in the city. A sequence was filmed at Sri Sita Ramachandra Swamy Temple in Ammapally near Shamshabad, in early March 2011. Scenes with Nani, Samantha, and Sudeep were filmed during the first shooting schedule, which was completed on 16 March. Shooting was disrupted in April by an ongoing labour dispute between film workers and producers. Rajamouli considered moving Eega out of Hyderabad if the strike continued. Filming continued in Kokapet in early September 2011, and principal photography was completed in late February 2012 as post-production began. According to Rajamouli, the film unit consulted a 3D video of the storyboard before shooting a scene each day. After the filming of each scene was completed, the editing and re-recording procedures were done with simple greyscale animation. An Arri Alexa camera, a prime lens, and Scorpio and Strada cranes were used for the principal photography, while a probe lens and high-intensity lighting were used for the macro photography. Senthil Kumar had to use a special lens with a minimum f-stop of f8.0; the wide apertures required high-intensity lighting to get acceptable shots. He used GoPro cameras as they were the smallest possible ones that offered close to professional resolution. Phantom Cam was used to film extreme slow motion sequences; certain scenes were shot at 2,000 frames per second. Digital intermediate (DI) was conducted at Annapurna Studios in Hyderabad. A high-end DI system was imported and the process took six months to complete. Singer Chinmayi, who dubbed for Samantha in Eega, found the process difficult because the footage did not contain the animated fly. Rajamouli approached Anuj Gurwara to write the dialogue for the Hindi-dubbed version titled Makkhi. The Hindi dubbing began in Hyderabad, and Gurwara dubbed for Nani in the film. Ajay Devgan and his wife Kajol, acting as parents telling the film's story to their child at bedtime, provided voiceovers during the opening credits of Makkhi. The visuals accompanying the closing credits were altered to show the fly mimicking the antics of Devgan, Salman Khan, and Akshay Kumar."

        "content": "R. C. Kamalakannan and Pete Draper of Makuta VFX oversaw Eega visual effects, and Rahul Venugopal was the film's set supervisor and matte painter. V. Srinivas Mohan, who later collaborated with Rajamouli on Baahubali: The Beginning, worked on a short sequence for the film. Rajamouli planned to complete work on the fly imagery in four months, but it took fourteen. Ninety percent of the animation-related work was done in Hyderabad; the remaining ten percent was completed in the United States. In an Indo-Asian News Service interview, Draper said he collaborated with thirteen experts and a large team of animators to design the fly. Because the film's fly's eyes comprise 80 percent of its face, Rajamouli felt they could make it expressive; he used the 1986 Pixar American short film Luxo Jr. for inspiration. The output of the first team of animators, using the reference material prepared, was unsatisfactory, and Rajamouli reworked the fly's detailing. Using a powerful lens, the film team conducted an arduous photographic shoot of unconscious flies in a bottle stored in a refrigerator. After enlarging the details, Rajamouli made cosmetic changes to the fly's face to make it look appealing onscreen. A new team, including Draper, three concept artists, three modellers, two shader designers, two hair and fur designers, three riggers and several animators, designed the animated fly in two months. Its head and fur were designed after shaping its body and wings. The fly was refined daily using clay models to expedite the process. The animators found the sequences between Sudeep and the fly much more difficult to execute because the latter had to express emotions only through its slender arms rather than its face. Some of the special effects could not be designed in India, so Makuta VFX engaged animation consultants in Armenia, China, Iran, Israel, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The company's 30-member team underwent a training programme on acting theory and insect formats. Eega is the first Indian film to use computer-generated imagery for nearly 90 minutes of its length; the film had 2,234 live-action animation shots. By mid-June 2012, Rajamouli had approved 1,970 shots; the final version was shown to the film unit after the approval of 226 pending shots. The visual effects cost an estimated 70\u00a0million."

        "title": "Eega_Themes",
        "content": "The film's main theme is revenge; the soul of a murdered man is reincarnated as a fly and seeks revenge against his killer. Rajamouli identified some similarities to David Cronenberg The Fly (1986), in which a scientist becomes a fly when his experiment malfunctions, and thought of Eega as a \"socio-fantasy\" rather than a science fiction film. At a meeting with students at the Annapurna International School of Film and Media Campus (AIFSM), he compared the battle between the fly and Sudeep, which the underdog fly wins, to David triumph over Goliath and India's victory in the 1983 Cricket World Cup. Crazy Mohan compared the film with Apoorva Sagodharargal (1989), a revenge drama whose protagonist Appu (Kamal Haasan) is a dwarf. Mohan told Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu that although the film's script may resemble those of Stuart Little (1999) and Shrek (2001), the use of the plight of someone tormented by a housefly was an original idea. According to Tamil film historian and actor Mohan Raman, Naan Eeunlike the animal-centred films Nalla Neram (1972) and Neeya? (1979)lacks a human protagonist. Film critic Baradwaj Rangan found Eega protagonist realistic, contrary to the ones in the animated films by the Walt Disney Company, except when it displays a few anthropomorphic traits.  Mid-Day compared Eega to Cockroach (2010), an Australian short film about a man who is reincarnated as a cockroach after he is accidentally killed on his wedding day. The film's secondary theme is the survival of love beyond death. Rangan has likened Eega to a ghost film because a dead protagonist returns to his loved ones as a troubled soul. Malini Mannath of The New Indian Express found the scene where the fly foils Sudeep's attempt to get close to Bindu reminiscent of one in the film Ghost (1990). Mayank Shekhar criticised the relationship between the lead pair, which he said advocates stalking as an accepted form of romance. Malathi Rangarajan said the antagonist took the \"extreme step\" of murdering the hero early in the film, in contrast with the stereotypical antagonist whose lust for the female lead has just begun and threatens the hero. Commenting on the usage of Tantrism, The New Indian Express Kruthi Grover found the death of the sorcerer similar to the story of Bhasmasur, a demon in Indian mythology to whom Shiva gives the power to reduce a person to ashes by touching her or his head. When Bhasmasur tries to touch Shiva's head, Vishnu assumes the form of Mohini and makes Bhasmasur touch his own head, killing him. According to Malathi Rangarajan, the film's themes of Tantrism and black magic are reminiscent of the use of the occult as a plot device in films directed by B. Vittalacharya."

        "content": "The soundtracks of Eega and Naan Ee, each consisting of five songsone of which is a remixed version of the film's title song\u2014were composed by M. M. Keeravani. Keeravani said because the film's theme of revenge and the protagonist (a housefly) are universal concepts, his \"only challenge\" was ensuring the music did not have a \"distinct ethnic or regional flavour\" and \"appeal\". He incorporated the buzzing sound made by flies into the score and exaggerated or reduced it according to a scene's emotional nature. Rajamouli approached Madhan Karky to write the lyrics for Naan Ee soundtrack after the release of Enthiran (2010), explaining the importance of each song in the film's narrative. As well as providing detailed profiles of the characters, Rajamouli enacted a few scenes, which helped Karky write the lyrics. Eega soundtrack was released on 4 April 2012 at a promotional event at Shanti Sarovar, Brahma Kumaris' academy in Gachibowli, a suburb of Hyderabad. The soundtrack for Naan Ee was released on 2 May at another promotional event at Sathyam Cinema in Chennai. Eega soundtrack release on iTunes was delayed until 7 April to avoid piracy and illegal downloads. Writing for The Hindu, Sangeetha Devi Dundoo called the soundtrack \"melodious\u00a0...\u00a0sharply contrasted by the background score, which seamlessly moves from sober to playful to pulsating\". Another critic for The Hindu, S. R. Ashok Kumar praised Vijay Prakash rendition of \"Konjam Konjam\". Kumar appreciated the use of violins in \"Eedaa Eedaa\" and called \"Lava Lava\" \"a good number\". Karthik Pasupulate of The Times of India wrote that Keeravani \"just seems to reserve his best for [Rajamouli]\", calling the soundtrack \"one of his finest\"."

On its second weekend, Eega grossed $253,334 from 42 screens in the US, bringing its ten-day total in that country to $913,046. By then, Naan Ee had grossed a total of $14,259 in the United States. Naan Ee earned 180\u00a0million in three weeks at the Tamil Nadu box office\u2014a record for a bilingual, Telugu-Tamil film. By early August 2012, the combined distributor share for the Telugu and Tamil versions was 570\u00a0million. The Hindi-dubbed version, Makkhi, had not achieved equivalent commercial success as of June 2015. According to Bangalore Mirror, the film grossed 1.15\u00a0billion globally as of August 2012. Its final global gross is estimated at 1.25 to 1.3\u00a0billion. Eega grossed nearly $1.08\u00a0million in the United States; it was one of the country's highest-grossing Telugu films. It was declared the highest-grossing bilingual film in Tamil Nadu after it earned 246.6\u00a0million, with a distributor share of 85\u00a0million, in 50 days. The film broke the record held by Arundhati (2009), whose Tamil-dubbed version earned a distributor share of 65\u00a0million. Indo-Asian News Service stated that Eega was the highest-grossing Telugu film of 2012, but Bangalore Mirror said it was the second-highest (after Gabbar Singh) in box-office revenue. According to Deccan Herald, Eega and Julayi were the only 2012 big-budget Telugu films to break even and have a positive audience response. Makkhi opened poorly, despite positive word-of-mouth, eventually ending up as an average grosser. Regarding the performance of Makkhi, Rajamouli felt the film was poorly presented and did not reach its theatrical audience even though it was better received on television, and so later on collaborated with filmmaker Karan Johar \u2013 whom he considered the \"one missing link\" \u2013 on the presentation of the Hindi-dubbed version of his later film, Baahubali: The Beginning."

V. S.

Rajeev Masand of CNN-News18 gave the film four stars out of five and praised its concept, and said Sudeep played his role with a \"true comic book flair\" and a \"cartoonish tinge\".

When Bhagavan's psychotic son Munna returns to India after 8 years, he mistreats the accountant Sabapathy and humiliates him. Receiving no support from Bhagavan, Sabapathy joins Kulkarni's gang, making Bhagavan order Jai to kill him. As per the plan, Jai kidnaps Rahul, the son of Kulkarni's brother Sampath. He asks Guruvayya to hold Rahul hostage at a club until he is back with Sabapathy. Jai demands a meeting with Sabapathy in exchange for Rahul's freedom. Sabapathy tells him he switched sides not to retaliate but to protect himself. Munna, on the other hand, visits the club to inquire about Jahnavi, a club dancer he is attracted to. Learning from Guruvayya that she loves Jai, Munna is enraged and kills Rahul after he teases him. He also kills Kulkarni's henchman, who came to pick up Rahul. When Sampath and Kulkarni receive no response, Jai tries to escape, and a chase ensues. He manages to flee but is shocked to learn of Rahul's death. Munna finds Jahnavi at Jai's house and beats her to death. Jai arrives and gets into a fight with Munna. Guruvayya sees Jai kill Munna and reports him to Bhagavan. Jai decides to tell Bhagavan the reason behind killing Munna, and is on his way attacked by the henchmen as per Bhagavan's orders. Following a gunfight, Jai escapes while Bhagavan vows to seek revenge for Munna's death. Jai escapes to Palasa, where he stays at his love interest Sandhya's house.

Neelima, in an interview, stated that she was a big fan of Pawan Kalyan. Vishnnuvardhan, following the release of his 2009 film Sarvam, which fared poorly at the box office, had been working on two scripts \u2013 the other one being the prequel to the 2007 version of Billa \u2013 but was unable to start either project due to unavailable dates of Pawan Kalyan and Ajith Kumar. He had planned to shoot both projects simultaneously from March 2011 onwards, but since that was not possible, he was forced to drop one of the projects, with Vishnuvardhan eventually deciding to direct this film. Abburi Ravi was roped in to write the dialogues, while the screenplay was provided by Rahul Koda."

The soundtrack album was originally planned to be launched on 6 November 2011 but was postponed due to the sudden demise of Yuvan Shankar Raja's mother. The audio launch was held on 18 November 2011 in a grand manner at the Gachibowli Indoor Stadium in Hyderabad. Along with the cast and crew, noted film personalities including directors K. Raghavendra Rao and S. S. Rajamouli, composer M. M. Keeravani and actor Rana Daggubati attended the function, which was anchored by comedian Ali and Suma Kanakala. The event was broadcast live on MAA TV. Upon release, the songs generally garnered positive response. The songs became chartbusters, with the title track Panjaa becoming the most played song in all Hyderabad radio channels, as well as the song of the year. 123Telugu gave a positive response stating \"Pawan Kalyan has tried out a new look for this movie and the buzz in the industry is that \u2018Panjaa\u2019 is going to be very different from his earlier flicks. The audio album reflects this. Yuvan\u2019s music is very different and modern. There are some pretty good numbers in this album. The title track \u2018Panjaa\u2019 absolutely rocks. \u2018Ela Ela\u2019 and \u2018Paparayudu\u2019 will be quite popular too. A better item number would have been a major asset. Do not expect a regular Pawan Kalyan style audio album this time. Listen to this album with an open mind and you will appreciate the music.\" In 2013, the film's music director Yuvan Shankar Raja reused the background score in the Tamil-language film Ameerin Aadhi-Bhagavan."

Thangavelu, Vijayakumari, M. Saroja, S. D. Subbulakshmi, A. Nageswara Rao and M. N. Nambiar play supporting roles. A triangular love story, it is about two close sisters whose lives turn upside down when they both fall in love with the same man. Out of respect, the younger sister decides to sacrifice her love, unknown to the elder sister. Kalyana Parisu was the directorial debut of Sridhar, who co-produced it with his partners S. Krishnamoorthy and T. Govindarajan under Venus Pictures. It also marked the cinematic debut of T. A. Sadagoppan (later known as Chitralaya Gopu) who worked as associate writer, and the debut of A. M. Rajah as a music composer in Tamil. Cinematography was handled by A. Vincent, and editing by N. M. Shankar. Kalyana Parisu was released on 9 April 1959. It was critically acclaimed, particularly for eschewing formulaic Tamil cinema conventions like long dialogues and fixed-point cinematography in favour of short verses with simple words and camera mobility. The film was commercially successful, running for over 25 weeks in theatres and thereby becoming a silver jubilee film. At the 7th National Film Awards, it won the Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film in Tamil. Kalyana Parisu emerged a milestone in Tamil cinema, and the breakthrough for Saroja Devi and Rajah. Its success led to Sridhar launching his own production company Chitralaya Pictures, and set the pattern for his later works in which he repeated the motif of the eternal triangle and unrequited love. The comedy subplot written by Gopu involving Thangavelu and M. Saroja gained popularity, and was sold separately on audio cassettes and vinyl records. The film was later remade by Sridhar in Telugu as Pelli Kanuka (1960) and Hindi as Nazrana (1961), and in Malayalam by J. Sasikumar as Sammanam (1975)."

Vasanthi approaches Baskar and apologises for her earlier act. Baskar forgives her, and they both fall in love. Vasanthi lives with her mother and unmarried elder sister Geetha. Baskar rents the vacant portion of their house. One day when Baskar falls ill, Geetha nurses him and in the process, falls in love with him. She confides her love to Vasanthi who is heartbroken, but decides to sacrifice her love out of respect for her sister. Since Geetha was responsible for raising Vasanthi, she is granted her wish, and Vasanthi convinces Baskar to marry Geetha. After Baskar and Geetha marry, they shift to Coimbatore where Baskar has been transferred. Meanwhile, Vasanthi has obtained employment as a typist. Her manager Raghu falls in love with her and expresses his desire to marry her, but she is unable to respond to his feelings. Baskar is unable to lead a happy life as he often thinks about his disappointment in love. Vasanthi writes to Baskar advising him to forget about the past and lead a happy life with Geetha; he relents. Shortly thereafter, Geetha becomes pregnant and returns to her original home where she delivers a son named Babu. Raghu again meets Vasanthi and proposes to her, but she tells him her past and expresses her inability to respond to his love. Heartbroken, Raghu leaves her and resigns from his job. Vasanthi joins Geetha at their Coimbatore house following her mother's death. When Geetha falls ill, Vasanthi attends to all the household work. Baskar spends more time with Vasanthi than his own wife, who suspects them of being in a relation, and berates them both. Due to this, Vasanthi leaves them. Geetha, having realised that Baskar and Vasanthi loved each other, dies in guilt, leaving Baskar alone to bring up Babu, making him promise that he will find Vasanthi and make her the child's mother. He searches for Vasanthi all over the city, to no avail. Meanwhile, Vasanthi meets with an accident, but is saved by a wealthy old man who allows her to stay in his house. The man's son arrives and is revealed to be Raghu, who Vasanthi agrees to marry. Through Sampath, Baskar learns about Vasanthi's impending marriage, and rushes to the marriage hall with Babu. However, by the time they arrive, Vasanthi is already married. Baskar then leaves Babu to her as a wedding gift, and walks away."

M. N. Nambiar portrayed Raghu's father, deviating from the negative roles he was generally known for. Child actor Babu portrayed Baskar's son by the same name in his debut.

When Sridhar told Kalyanasundaram told the complete storyline of Kalyana Parisu in detail, Kalyanasundaram felt it was too \"longwinded\" and summed it up in two lines: \"Kaathalile tholviyutraal kanni oruthi, kalangukiral avanai nenjil niruthi\" (A virgin had lost her love, she is heartbroken about him). Sridhar was surprised at this since he had struggled to develop the storyline for months. Though initially depressed, he felt the lines were true and asked Kalyanasundaram to develop them into a song; the result was \"Kaathalile Tholviyutraal\". According to Sridhar, the song was originally \"meant as a criticism! So, one shouldn't be scared of criticism. We should use it to catalyze our imagination.\" The Diwali-themed song \"Unnaikkandu Naanada\" is set in Bilahari, a Carnatic raga. The song \"Tea Tea Tea\", sung by Sirkazhi Govindarajan, is picturised on Sampath, a tea seller, and deviated from the divine, philosophical songs Govindarajan was generally known for. The film follows a then convention of Tamil cinema to feature the same song sung twice: once in joy and once in sorrow. A version of the soundtrack released by Odeon Records in 1983 includes only four songs: \"Thullatha Manamum\", P. Susheela's version of \"Unnaikkandu Naanada\" (listed as \"Unnaikandu\"), \"Vaadikkai Maranthathum\" and \"Mangayar Mugathil\" (listed as \"Akkalukku Valaikappu\").

The story follows the forbidden love between a fisherman and a farmer's daughter. Balink began work on the film in 1934, working with the Wong brothers, who served as cinematographers. They gathered a budget of 75,000 gulden\u00a0\u2013 several times the budget of other local productions\u00a0\u2013 and brought Franken from the Netherlands to assist in production. The film was edited in the Netherlands after being shot in the Indies. The film was a commercial and critical success with European audiences, but disliked by native ones; despite this success, Pareh bankrupted its producers. Pareh resulted in a change in the cinema of Dutch East Indies, which had been Chinese-oriented for several years; films began to make more effort at targeting local audiences.  Balink later found commercial success with Terang Boelan (1937). The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider considers Pareh and Terang Boelan the two most important cinematic works from the Dutch East Indies during the 1930s."

        "content": "During 1934 and early 1935, all feature films released in the Dutch East Indies had been produced by The Teng Chun, based on Chinese mythology or martial arts, and targeted at low-class audiences, generally ethnic Chinese. This situation was created by the Great Depression, which had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes, advertisers asking for more money, and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices; this ensured that there was a very low profit margin for local films. During this period cinemas in the country mainly showed Hollywood productions. Albert Balink, a Dutch journalist, began work on what was to become Pareh in 1934. Unlike The Teng Chun, the inexperienced Balink chose to target his film at Dutch audiences. He brought in two of the Wong brothers, Chinese filmmakers who had been inactive since making Zuster Theresia (Sister Theresa) in 1932. The Wongs donated their studio\u00a0\u2013 an old tapioca flour factory\u00a0\u2013 as well as filmmaking equipment. Meanwhile, much of the funding came from other backers. According to the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran, the money came from the cinema mogul Buse, while EYE Film Institute records indicate that the film was backed by the Centrale Commissie voor Emigratie en Kolonisatie van Inheemschen and meant to promote migration from Java to Sumatra. Balink and the Wongs spent most of two years compiling the necessary funds, with Balink in charge of general operations as the head of Java Pacific Film, a joint operation. Balink insisted on perfection and had a clear idea what kind of actor he wanted in the film. Unlike earlier filmmakers in the country, Balink invested time and money in searching for the best locations and actors possible, without considering whether a person was already a celebrity. Ultimately, most of those cast for Pareh had not acted before, including stars Mochtar and Soekarsih. The role of Mahmud was filled when Balink was out with coffee with Joshua and Othniel Wong and saw a young man, tall, strong, and handsome\u00a0\u2013 as he expected for the role\u00a0\u2013 driving by. Balink called the Wongs and they got into their car, then chased and caught the young man. The man, Mochtar, a Javanese of noble descent, was told to use the title Raden for the film, which he and his family had already abandoned. According to the Indonesian anthropologist Albertus Budi Susanto, the emphasis on Mochtar's title was meant as a way to draw a higher-class audience. Artistic direction and some of the screenwriting was handled by Mannus Franken, an avant-garde documentary filmmaker from the Netherlands, whom Balink had brought to the Indies. Franken insisted on including ethnographic shots to better present the local culture to international audiences. Franken took an interest in the documentary and ethnographic aspects of the film, directing the shots for these portions, while the Wongs handled the general shots. According to Biran, this was reflected in the camera angles used. Pareh, which had been recorded on 35 mm film using single-system devices, was brought to the Netherlands for editing. There the original voices of the cast were dubbed by actors in the Netherlands, resulting in stilted language use and heavy Dutch accents. Though initially the filmmakers had planned on using gamelan music, the poor quality of the recording equipment in the Indies led to the soundtrack being redone, using European-style music, in the Netherlands. From start to finish the production of Pareh cost 75,000 gulden (approximately US$ 51,000), 20\u00a0times as much as a regular local production. After editing there were 2,061 metres of film, equivalent to 92 minutes of runtime."

        "content": "Pareh was screened in the Netherlands as Pareh, een Rijstlied van Java (also noted as Het Lied van de Rijst) beginning on 20\u00a0November 1936. The film was also shown in the Indies. It was unable to recoup its costs and bankrupted the producers. The film was critically acclaimed in the Netherlands, partially owing to the emphasis of Franken's involvement. Although it was a commercial success amongst the intelligentsia in the Indies, Pareh was a failure with lower-class native audiences. Mochtar never viewed the film in full. Historical reception of Pareh has generally been positive. Writing in 1955, the Indonesian author and cultural critic Armijn Pane opined that Pareh was technically unparalleled in contemporary Indies cinema, with careful continuity and dynamic cuts. He was critical, however, of the film's tendency to see the Indies' native population through European eyes and depict them as \"primitive\". The American film historian John Lent, writing in 1990, described Pareh as a \"meticulously detailed and costly\" film which attempted to not only earn money, but show the local culture. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider considers Pareh one of the two most important cinematic works from the Dutch East Indies during the 1930s; Balink's later work Terang Boelan (Full Moon; 1937) was the other. Heider, John H. McGlynn, and Salim Said note that the film was of acceptable technical quality but is best remembered for changing the path of cinematic developments in the country."

        "content": "The release of Pareh was followed by a shift in genres popularised by the local cinema. The Teng Chun, who\u00a0\u2013 together with Balink\u00a0\u2013 continued to be the only active filmmaker in the country until 1937, began focusing on more modern stories and those which would be popular with native audiences. Biran suggests that this was influenced by Pareh. Other filmmakers in the late 1930s, partially inspired by Pareh, began to improve the quality of the audio in their films. Pane notes that, following Pareh, films produced domestically no longer centred around ethnic European casts. Mochtar and Soekarsih, who first met on the set of Pareh, married after appearing together in Terang Boelan. This later production included much of the same cast and was highly successful, leading to a renewed interest in filmmaking in the Indies. Terang Boelan proved to be the most successful local production until 1953's Krisis (Crisis), released after Indonesia had become independent."

Cameron has been shoplifting and kissing her friend Irene Klauson while her parents die in a car accident at Quake Lake, which they visited every year. Cameron's very religious Aunt Ruth moves in with Cameron and her grandmother. Cameron begins renting VHS movies and decorating her old dollhouse to cope with her grief, and stops spending time with Irene. Irene's family discovers a fossil on their property, which results in great success and wealth for them, and Irene goes away to a boarding school. At Aunt Ruth's request, Cameron begins attending a new church, Gates of Praise, and its youth group, Firepower. During the summer before starting high school, Cameron becomes close friends with Lindsey Lloyd, who joins the swim team with her while she stays with her father in Miles City for the summer. Lindsey is a lesbian and tells Cameron about her experiences with queer pride in Seattle, where she lives during the rest of the year with her mother. Cameron and Lindsey pursue a casual relationship, which mostly consists of kissing. They stay in touch after Lindsey returns to Seattle at the end of the summer. Aunt Ruth begins dating Ray, who sells frozen goods around the local area. Cameron becomes friends with Coley Taylor, who is in her biology class and starts driving her to Firepower meetings. Cameron develops a crush on Coley, despite the fact that Coley has a boyfriend, Brett. Coley convinces Cameron to join her and Brett at prom. Cameron invites her best friend Jamie to prom. On prom night, Jamie realizes that Cameron is attracted to Coley. He thinks Cameron is confused and kisses her. Cameron and Jamie begin dating after that, but Cameron is never interested in anything beyond kissing him. Cameron and Jamie argue and break up at Miles City's annual Bucking House Sale because Jamie hooked up with another girl. Cameron goes home with Coley and they kiss, leading Coley to feel very confused. Over the following summer, Cameron and Coley both get summer jobs and Brett goes away for soccer camp. Cameron and Coley begin going to the movies after work to kiss in the dark. Meanwhile, Ruth and Ray get engaged. Cameron learns that one of the lifeguards with whom she works has dated a girl before. Reverend Rick Roneous, the leader of a new full-time school that treats gay people called God's Promise, visits a Firepower meeting, which makes Cameron and Coley uncomfortable. Coley gets her own apartment in Miles City. Cameron brings a movie to watch with Coley alone in her apartment, which features lesbian vampires. Cameron and Coley drink alcohol and begin kissing during the movie, then have sex in Coley's bed. Coley's brother Ty and his friends interrupt them and Cameron quickly leaves. Cameron feels upset after work that day when Coley doesn't visit her and decides to make out with her coworker. When Cameron returns home, she learns that Ruth invited the pastor to the house and announces that Coley revealed what they had done together and as a result sends Cameron to God's Promise. At God's Promise, Cameron meets her new friends Jane Fonda, Lakota two spirit Adam and her roommate Erin. She has one-on-one meetings with Reverend Rick and Lydia March. Cameron grows closer to Jane and Adam and they sneak away together to smoke pot Jane has grown. Eventually, Rick feels that Cameron has earned the privilege to decorate her room and receive her mail. Cameron gets a letter from Coley that expresses her shame at what had happened between them, which upsets Cameron. Cameron returns home for Christmas. She attends Ruth and Ray's wedding, but refuses to be Ruth's maid of honor. She does not get to confront Coley before she leaves. Back at God's Promise, Mark Turner, a boy in Cameron's group sessions, has a breakdown during a session when speaking about how his father would not accept him. Overnight, Mark severely injures himself by using a razor to cut his genitals and pouring bleach over the wounds. Rick brings Mark to the hospital, but will not admit that this was a suicide attempt. This leads the authorities to investigate God's Promise. Cameron tells the officers who come to investigate that the camp's entire mission is to make the kids hate themselves, but God's Promise carries on. Cameron, Jane, and Adam plan to leave God's Promise. After finals, the three of them take a hiking trip but keep going until they reach Quake Lake, and Cameron finally finds closure with her parents' death."

After Srinivas narrated the script to Kalyan, he asked him who would play the role of his aunt and Srinivas replied it would be Nadhiya. Kalyan gave his approval for Srinivas's selection and Nadhiya was selected before she signed her comeback film in Telugu, Mirchi (2013). Srinivas narrated the script in a conversation with her over the telephone. After she accepted, he said that he would ask her dates after their schedules were planned. She later revealed that she was scared of being typecast but did the role only on Srinivas' insistence and added that the character's emotions were set quite well. Srinivas decided to cast Ileana D'Cruz as the female lead who worked with him on Jalsa and Julai. Samantha was confirmed as the female lead in late October 2012 which marked her first collaboration with Kalyan. The second female lead was yet to be selected. By the end of December 2012, most of the films which were in the pre-production phase were confirming their female leads. Because of this the production unit decided to begin the shoot without confirming the other heroine. Pranitha Subhash was selected as the second female lead in early January 2013 and was confirmed to play Samantha's sister. Pranitha called it a lifetime opportunity and said that she would be seen in a \"very sweet, girl-next-door character.\" Boman Irani made his debut in Telugu with Attarintiki Daredi; he played Raghunandan, the grandfather of Kalyan's character. Kota Srinivasa Rao played the role of Sidhappa Naidu for which he sported a realistic and rugged look. Navika Kotia was selected for the role of the younger sister of Samantha and Pranitha in April 2013. Srinivas did not cast his regular associate Sunil in the film. Since Sunil's success of Maryada Ramanna (2010) and Poola Rangadu (2012) as a lead actor, Srinivas felt that it would not be fair to make him play a comedian. Rao Ramesh, Mukesh Rishi, Brahmanandam, Ali, M. S. Narayana and Posani Krishna Murali were cast in supporting roles. Mumtaj and Hamsa Nandini were confirmed to make special appearances in the song \"Its Time To Party\" marking the former's comeback in Telugu cinema after 12 years after anchor Anasuya refused the offer."

        "content": "Attarintiki Daredi focuses on a young man's journey trying to convince his estranged paternal aunt to reconcile with the family. In its review, Sify felt that the film's story was a reversal of Nuvvu Naaku Nachav (2001) and Parugu (2008). Kalyan's character, Gautham, is shown watching a few films, where the protagonist is in disguise trying to win over people who matter to him. In the film, Brahmanandam's character spoofs the Ridley Scott film, Gladiator (2000) named Radiator and wins the Bascar awards found by himself after being inspired from the Academy Awards. The mythological tale of Indra seducing Ahalya after disguising as her husband Gautama and the curse cast by Gautama on them is parodied in the film with Brahmanandam playing a key role. Two songs were parodied: one of them being a devotional song \"Kaatama Rayuda\" written by the poet Etla Ramadasa and composed by Chittoor V. Nagaiah for the film Sumangali (1940), and the other an item number \"Kevvu Keka\" written by Sahithi and composed by Devi Sri Prasad for the film Gabbar Singh (2012). A scene from the film, popularly known as the \"badam tree\" episode, was based on a similar scene from the 2012 English film A Thousand Words."

        "content": "On the night of 22 September 2013, a 90-minute piece of footage was leaked online and was widely shared. B. V. S. N. Prasad filed a complaint the following day against the copyright violation, and sought cyber-protection for Attarintiki Daredi. Because of this incident, the film's release was delayed to 27 September 2013. The film's female lead, Samantha, as well as other celebrities such as Siddharth, Harish Shankar, S. S. Rajamouli, Ram Gopal Varma and Nithiin, condemned the unauthorised distribution act. However, police initially suspected that the incident might be a publicity stunt enacted by people who invested in the film. On being informed about the alleged sale of the movie in different electronic formats in the CD and mobile shops in Pedana town, Superintendent of Police J. Prabhakara Rao deployed a special team, led by Pedana Rural Circle Inspector A. Pallapu Raju, to investigate the issue. The police launched a hunt for unlicensed compact discs in the CD shops across the district. CDs and hard disks from video parlours and shops renting CDs in the Krishna district were seized, and some of the shop owners were taken into custody for questioning. Kalyan's fans went out into the streets, with signs containing slogans protesting the piracy. Subsequent to their investigation, the police arrested five people, in addition to production assistant Cheekati Arunkumar, and recovered several illegitimate copies of the film on 20 September 2013. Arunkumar had worked as a production assistant for the films Oosaravelli (2011) and Ongole Gittha (2013), both of which were produced by B. V. S. N. Prasad. Prabhakara Rao told the media that Arunkumar had given a copy of the DVD to his friend and Hyderabad-based APSP constable, Katta Ravi, who sent it to his friend, V. Sudheer Kumar, on 14 September 2013. Pedana-based videographer Poranki Suresh got the DVD from Sudheer Kumar, and later gave it to Kollipalli Anil Kumar, who owns the Devi Mobiles and Cell repair shop in Pedana. Anil Kumar had uploaded the two-part movie into his system, and sold the 60-minute part-one of the movie to his customers in different formats. Anil Kumar deleted the original file in his system after learning about the police raids. However, he confessed to the crime during the investigation. Based on the information given by Anil Kumar, a special team led by Machilipatnam DSP K.V. Srinivasa Rao, with the support of the Crime Investigation Department, Hyderabad, arrested the suspects in Hyderabad. The police filed charges on 24 September 2013, against the five suspects under clauses 63, 65 and 66 of the Copyright (Amendment Bill) 2010 and 429 IPC. Kalyan and Srinivas decided to return a significant portion of their remuneration to help Prasad overcome the financial crisis caused by the leak. Samantha returned her entire salary to the producers. Kalyan remained silent during the entire issue, but finally spoke at length about the episode at the \"Thank You Meet\" of the film on 14 October 2013. He said that this was a conspiracy and not piracy. He added that he was very well aware of the facts as to who was behind the leak of the film and will not spare anyone and will strike when the time is right."

It was released on 20 July 2013, in Japan, and was released by Touchstone Pictures in North America on 21 February 2014. The Wind Rises is a fictionalised biographical film of Jiro Horikoshi (1903\u20131982), designer of the Mitsubishi A5M fighter aircraft and its successor, the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, used by the Empire of Japan during World War II. The film is adapted from Miyazaki's manga of the same name, which was in turn loosely based on both the 1937 novel The Wind Has Risen by Tatsuo Hori and the life of Jiro Horikoshi. It was the final film directed by Miyazaki before his retirement in September 2013. However, in 2017, Miyazaki announced he had come out of retirement to direct How Do You Live?, which is expected to be released in 2023. The Wind Rises was the highest-grossing Japanese film in Japan in 2013. It received critical acclaim and was nominated for several awards, including nominations for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year."

        "content": "In 1918, a young Jiro Horikoshi longs to become a pilot, but his nearsightedness prevents it. One night, he dreams of his idol, the Italian aircraft designer Giovanni Battista Caproni, who tells him that he has never flown a plane in his life, and that building planes is better than flying them. Five years later, Jiro is traveling by train to study aeronautical engineering at Tokyo Imperial University and meets a young girl, Naoko Satomi, traveling with her maid. When the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 hits, Naoko's maid's leg is broken and Jiro carries her to Naoko's family, leaving without giving his name. In 1927, Jiro graduates with his friend Kiro Honjo and both are employed at aircraft manufacturer Mitsubishi, assigned to design a fighter plane, the Mitsubishi 1MF9, for the Imperial Army. During a test, it breaks apart mid-air and is thus rejected. Dispirited about the seeming backwardness of Japanese technology, Jiro and Honjo are sent to the Weimar Republic in 1929 to carry out technical research and obtain a production license for a Junkers G.38 aircraft. Jiro dreams again of Caproni, who tells him that the world is better for the beauty of planes, even if humankind might put them to terrible purposes. In early 1932, Jiro is promoted to chief designer for a fighter plane competition sponsored by the Imperial Navy, but his design, the Mitsubishi 1MF10, fails testing in 1933 and is rejected. Disappointed, Jiro goes to a summer resort in Karuizawa to rest, where he meets Naoko again. Castorp, a German visitor privately critical of the Nazi regime, tells Jiro, who intends to visit Dessau, that Hugo Junkers is in trouble for fighting Nazism, and that Germany will go to war again, thus must be stopped. Later, Jiro asks Naoko's father for his blessing to marry her, and the two are engaged. However, Naoko has tuberculosis and wants to wait until she recovers to marry. Castorp assists in the romance before fleeing arrest by the Japanese secret police. Wanted in connection with Castorp, Jiro hides at his supervisor's home while he works on a new navy project. Following a lung hemorrhage, Naoko recovers in a mountain sanatorium but cannot bear being apart from Jiro, and returns to marry him. Jiro's sister Kayo, a doctor, warns Jiro that his marriage to Naoko will end tragically as tuberculosis is incurable. Though Naoko's health deteriorates, she and Jiro enjoy their time together. Jiro leaves for the test flight of his new prototype aircraft, the Mitsubishi A5M. Knowing that she will die soon, Naoko returns to the sanatorium, leaving letters for Jiro, her family, and friends. At the test site, Jiro is distracted from his success by a gust of wind, suggesting Naoko's passing. In the summer of 1945, after Japan lost World War II, Jiro dreams of Caproni again, regretting that his aircraft was used for war. Caproni comforts him, saying that Jiro's dream of building beautiful aircraft was nonetheless realized. Naoko appears, encouraging her husband to live his life to the fullest."

        "content": "The Wind Rises was directed by Hayao Miyazaki, whose previous films include My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, and Spirited Away. It was the first film that Miyazaki solely directed since Ponyo in 2008. Miyazaki began to conceive a story to illustrate the life of Jiro Horikoshi in 2008. He published the story as a manga series in the monthly magazine  Model Graphix from April 2009 to January 2010, with the title borrowed from Tatsuo Hori's novel The Wind Has Risen (). The story in the manga follows the historical account of Horikoshi's aircraft development up to 1935 (the year of the Mitsubishi A5M maiden flight), and intertwines with fictional encounters with Caproni and Nahoko Satomi (). The scenes with Nahoko in the manga were adopted from the novel The Wind Has Risen, in which Tatsuo Hori wrote about his life experience with his fianc\u00e9e, Ayako Yano (), before she died from tuberculosis. The name Nahoko Satomi was borrowed from the female protagonist of another novel by Tatsuo Hori, Nahoko (). Characters frequently discuss Thomas Mann's novel The Magic Mountain, and, in a letter to Nahoko, Jiro names his fleeing German friend \"Mr. Castorp\" after its protagonist. The character himself is a caricature of Stephen Alpert, who was once the executive director of Ghibli's international division. He left the company in 2011 for personal reasons, but was instrumental in Ghibli's overseas expansion, and as a model for the character's appearance and a suitable voice, he was asked to come to Japan to appear in the film. After the release of Ponyo, Miyazaki wanted his next film to be a sequel, Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea II, but producer Toshio Suzuki proposed to adopt the manga The Wind Has Risen instead. At first, Miyazaki rejected the proposal because he created the manga as a hobby and considered its subjects not suitable for children, the traditional audience of the feature animations from Studio Ghibli. However, Miyazaki changed his mind and withdrew his objection after a staff member suggested that \"children should be allowed to be exposed to subjects they are not familiar with\". Miyazaki was inspired to make the film after reading a quote from Horikoshi: \"All I wanted to do was to make something beautiful\"."

It had its official North American premiere at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival, although a sneak preview of the film was presented earlier at the 2013 Telluride Film Festival (the film screened outside the official program). Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures distributed the film in North America through its Touchstone Pictures banner. The film's English dubbing was directed by Gary Rydstrom. Disney held a one-week release window in the Los Angeles theatrical circuit for the film beginning on 8 November 2013, so that it could qualify for Academy Awards consideration.

Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score, rated the film an 83/100 based on 41 reviews, citing \"universal acclaim\". Film critic David Ehrlich rated the film 9.7/10 and called it, \"Perhaps the greatest animated film ever made.\" Ehrlich further writes, \"While initially jarring, Miyazaki's unapologetic deviations from fact help The Wind Rises to transcend the linearity of its expected structure, the film eventually revealing itself to be less of a biopic than it is a devastatingly honest lament for the corruption of beauty, and how invariably pathetic the human response to that loss must be. Miyazaki\u2019s films are often preoccupied with absence, the value of things left behind and how the ghosts of beautiful things are traced onto our memories like the shadows of objects outlined by a nuclear flash. The Wind Rises looks back as only a culminating work can.\" The Japan Times gave the film a 3  stars out of 5, and states \"A visually sumptuous celebration of an unspoiled prewar Japan.\" In a review for The Asia-Pacific Journal, Matthew Penney wrote \"What Miyazaki offers is a layered look at how Horikoshi's passion for flight was captured by capital and militarism\", and \"(the film) is one of Miyazaki's most ambitious and thought-provoking visions as well as one of his most beautifully realized visual projects\"."

        "content": "is a 2013 Japanese anime drama film written, directed and edited by Makoto Shinkai, animated by CoMix Wave Films and distributed by Toho. It stars Miyu Irino and Kana Hanazawa, and features music by Daisuke Kashiwa instead of Tenmon, who had composed the music for many of Shinkai's previous films. The theme song, \"Rain\", was originally written and performed by Senri Oe in 1988, but was remade for the film and was sung by Motohiro Hata. The film was made into a manga, with illustrations by Midori Motohashi, and later novelized by Shinkai, both in the same year as the film. The film focuses on Takao Akizuki, an aspiring 15-year-old shoemaker, and Yukari Yukino, a mysterious 27-year-old woman he keeps meeting at Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden on rainy mornings. While Takao is skipping his morning class to design shoes, Yukari is avoiding work due to personal problems in her professional life. Yukari tells Takao nothing about herself, including her name, while Takao opens up to her, sharing his passion for shoes by offering to make a pair for her. When Takao learns Yukari's identity, emotions come to a head as both learn that they have been teaching each other \"how to walk\". Shinkai wrote the story as a tale of \"lonely sadness\", based on the meaning of the traditional Japanese word for \"love\", and uses shoes as a metaphor for life. The story's motifs include rain, Man'y\u014dsh\u016b poetry, and the Japanese garden. The age difference between the two main characters and their character traits demonstrate how awkwardly and disjointedly people mature, where even adults sometimes feel no more mature than teenagers, according to Shinkai. The Garden of Words premiered at the Gold Coast Film Festival in Australia on April 28, 2013 and had its general release on May 31, 2013 in Japan. For the Japanese premiere, the film was screened with an animated short called , also directed by Shinkai. The Garden of Words had an unusual release schedule since it was released digitally on iTunes the same day as the Japanese theatrical premier, and its DVD and Blu-ray were released while the film was still in theaters, on June 21. The film has been licensed by Sentai Filmworks in North America, Anime Limited in the UK, and Madman Entertainment in Australia. The film performed well in theaters for an extended period of time and was hosted at many local and international film events. It ranked highly on iTunes Store during 2013 and was selected as the Year's Best Animation in iTunes' Best of 2013. It won the 2013 Kobe Theatrical Film Award and awards at the Fantasia International Film Festival and the Stuttgart Festival of Animated Film. Online reviews were generally favorable with universal praise of the art, though opinions were mixed regarding the story's length, plot and emotional climax."

        "content": "The Garden of Words opens at the start of the rainy season in Tokyo with , a 15-year-old student and aspiring shoemaker, opting to skip his first class and sketch shoe designs in the garden at Shinjuku Gyoen. There, he encounters , a 27-year-old woman who is skipping work. Yukari bids him farewell with a tanka (a form of Japanese poetry), leaving Takao puzzled as to its origin and meaning. The two continue to encounter each other and socialize in the park on rainy mornings, but never formally introduce themselves. Takao decides to make a pair of shoes in her size. With the end of the rainy season, he stops visiting the park and focuses on his work. Following summer break, Takao returns to school and spots Yukari, discovering that she is a literature teacher and had been the target of gossip and bullying. To avoid further confrontation, Yukari opted to avoid work and retreat to the park, hoping she would learn to overcome her fears. However, she quits her job and leaves the school. That afternoon, Takao meets Yukari at the park and greets her by reciting the 2,514th poem from the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b Japanese poetry collection, the correct response to her tanka, which he found in a classic Japanese literature textbook. After getting soaked by a sudden thunderstorm, both head to Yukari's apartment and spend the afternoon together. When Takao confesses his love, Yukari is moved, but reminds him that she is a teacher and that she is moving back to her hometown on Shikoku. After Takao excuses himself, Yukari realizes her mistake and runs after him. Still upset, Takao angrily takes back what he had said and criticizes her for being so secretive and never opening up to him. Yukari embraces him and the two cry while she explains that their time together in the park had saved her. The credits show Takao barely passing his final exams, but still working towards his goals, while Yukari moves back to Shikoku and resumes her teaching career. In a post-credits scene, Takao revisits the park that winter, reads a letter from Yukari, places her finished shoes on the bench, then vows that he will find her after he has made progress with his career. Both the manga and serial novels share differences from the anime-film. In the manga illustrated by Midori Motohashi, scenes were either added or slightly modified from the anime version. For example, after the conclusion of the rainy season, Takao was unable to visit the park during the only rainy morning that summer because he had scheduled to visit the footwear college he wanted to attend, disappointing Yukari who had hoped to see him. At the conclusion of the story, Yukari is seen wearing the shoes Takao had made for her. In the novel, Takao prepared to study abroad in Italy for his cobbling, and had a party with his family. Before he was in Italy, he exchanged letters with Yukari every month or so, and ended up leaving his email address in one of them. Now with each others' email addresses, every message they sent avoided discussing personal issues such as if they were seeing anyone. In May 2018, he had some days off and decided to return to Tokyo, in which he reunited with Yukari at the garden and delivered his promised shoes."

The animated film was produced by Shinkai Creative, CoMix Wave Films, and the producer was Noritaka Kawaguchi. Kenichi Tsuchiya was the animation director and was responsible for character design, while Hiroshi Takiguchi was the art director. Planning for the film began in the spring of 2012 and was announced on December 24 of that year. The Japanese release was initially slated for the first half of 2013. Production took only six months, starting with location scouting by Shinkai around Shinjuku. Production officially started after he had created storyboards based on the photos he took. Shinkai was approached in early 2013 about adapting the material into a manga, which was then done by Midori Motohashi. In April, Shinkai stated that he was not contributing to the adaptation, leaving the work entirely to the manga artist. However, he did express interest in seeing the finished product."

        "title": "The Garden of Words_Inspirations, motifs, and metaphors",
        "content": "According to Shinkai's announcement of the film early during its production, The Garden of Words was his first attempt at making a love story using the traditional Japanese meaning of \"love\". During the era of the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b, the native Japanese words today known as  were starting to be written using kanji, and the word for \"love\", koi (today written \u604b) was written as \u5b64\u60b2, or \"lonely sadness\". As noted by Shinkai, a more modern concept of \"romance\", represented by , came about by Western influence. The Garden of Words emphasizes the original meaning of koi\u2014a \"longing for someone in solitude\"\u2014but in a modern setting. Loneliness is the central element of the film, according to Shinkai. In an interview, he said he created the film with the hope of cheering up people who feel lonely or incomplete in their social relations. However, he made a point that \"this movie doesn't treat loneliness as something that must be fixed.\" Although the story's central theme is loneliness, it uses shoes and rain as motifs, along with Man'y\u014dsh\u016b poetry and the Japanese garden in which it is set. Although rain is typically seen as sad and gloomy, in The Garden of Words it makes the world more vivid and protects the two main characters from the reality of their lives and the limitations imposed by society. Shinkai also noted a parallel between love and rain\u2014that neither can be controlled or stopped. According to Shinkai, shoes were a metaphor for life as Yukari learned to walk again, while Takao's shoe-making typified their relationship. Similarly, Yukari's choice of food and beverages\u2014initially beer and chocolate, due to a stress-induced taste disorder\u2014was a metaphor for her emotional health. In many of Shinkai's films, sad endings resulting from misunderstandings and unrequited feelings are common. According to Shinkai, his stories are intended to encourage teenagers as they learn to cope with these commonplace experiences. In an interview, he admitted that he had been accustomed to being turned down by women, and felt that his stories were encouraging because his characters continue to try, despite being unsuccessful at love. The Garden of Words also illustrated how people do not mature as linearly or elegantly as we often assume. Shinkai himself could relate with Yukari in not feeling as smart or mature at age 27, stating, \"We're all still just children at age 27,\" a point that voice actress Kana Hanazawa also agreed with. The original idea for The Garden of Words came from Shinkai's desire to capture the beauty of the daily scenery in modern Tokyo and showcase it in a film. Having lived for ten years in Shinjuku, he selected it as the location of the film and set about taking thousands of photos, upon which he created his storyboards. Wanting to share the peace and harmony of his favorite locations in Japan with the hope that it would encourage people to visit, Shinkai modeled the garden in the film to match Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden in Tokyo. Following the earthquake in March 2011, he was worried that it could be destroyed and wanted to preserve it in an animated film."

        "content": "Like other Japanese anime, The Garden of Words was created using a combination of hand-drawn animation, rotoscoping and computer animation (CGI), with the latter facilitating the realistic appearance of the film's rain sequences. Shinkai made half of the film's backgrounds by using his photographs as a base and then drawing over the top with Adobe Photoshop, while the other half were fictional settings created with traditional animation and computer graphics. As with his other films, the backgrounds are vivid and meticulously drawn scenery while the characters are drawn with less detail, though they are still convincing and realistic. For the rainy scenes at the park, the color palette was toned down, and pale green shading was used to match the gloomy, rainy weather, thereby increasing the detail and defining the characters. Matching the tones to the background and lighting helped highlight the characters' faces. According to Shinkai, a novel coloring method was chosen from other coloring methods following careful testing. The method involved integrating the coloring for each character with the background, a \"new innovation of sorts\" that mimics the refraction of light on the skin as seen in nature. This was accomplished by coloring the outline of the character, including the lines drawn for the separation of lit and shadowed surfaces, and then incorporating the background color onto the surface. Shinkai felt that this coloring method made the anime stand out from others."

        "content": "Shinkai originally envisioned Takao as a boy who wants to help people, but also felt that he should have a passion for making something, since creative work can be rewarding and fulfilling. On a list he made of potential crafts, he picked out the word \"shoes\". After testing it out with his initial plans for the story, he found that it worked out, and in hindsight, he realized that shoemakers also assist people with walking. When first presenting the original story to the rest of his team, the team learned that Yukari had unintentionally come across as selfish. To remedy this, he gave her character nervous traits and personality flaws, such as letting her emotions spill over during mildly upsetting events. Shinkai later realized that some of these personality quirks and temporary professional challenges seen in Yukari were present in a former girlfriend, for whom he had written his short film She and Her Cat. In addition to making Yukari's character more convincing, these character flaws also made it more difficult to plan since she had to be both flawed and attractive to a young boy. One aspect of her character that Shinkai focused on was her appearance. He felt that she had to be dressed in nice clothes, and particularly nice shoes. In order to balance realism with fashion, he researched shoemaking, worked with a clothing coordinator and stylist, and held weekly fashion meetings with his staff. One of the \"complicated realistic elements\" of Yukari's character was her sense of purity that only her voice could convey. Though it took days of listening to the audition tapes, Shinkai finally chose Kana Hanazawa, who had a very low natural voice, despite typically playing the roles of high-pitched younger girls. One of the things that impressed Shinkai about Hanazawa's voice was her ability to cover such a broad range of expression. It was the final scene of the film that made Shinkai glad he had cast Hanazawa. He knew that when Yukari cried, it had to be something impressive in order to emphasize an intense release of emotion. According to Shinkai, music alone could not produce the needed effect, and Hanazawa performed perfectly and without instruction. In an interview, he said, \"I believe that Ms. Hanazawa's acting on that crying scene alone completes the film.\" This final scene, which was recorded perfectly on the first take, played a pivotal role in the casting decision for Takao's character. Though many Japanese voice actors could portray a na\u00efve 15-year-old boy, Shinkai immediately recognized that only Miyu Irino could produce the intense emotion needed for the closing scene. Irino had also played Shun and Shin in Shinkai's Children Who Chase Lost Voices. In regards to the English dub, Shinkai did not feel that he could judge the quality of the voice acting since he could not speak English natively. He felt that it was good due to the feedback he had received and because he could feel the emotion in the characters' voices. However, he noted that the experience would be different for viewers and that the final judgment could only be made by English-speaking audiences."

Instead, he intended for people to casually view the film on tablets, computers, and in home theaters. A target length was never specified from the outset, instead the relationship between Takao and Yukari was emphasized, although it was known from early in the production that the film would be short. Shinkai acknowledged that it is difficult to sell 46-minute films in theaters; however, many individuals in the industry had requested to show the film in theaters and conventions.

Shinkai listened to these albums while writing the screenplay and then elected to base the film's music off of the songs from Kashiwa's album 88. In an interview, Shinkai said that the music was primarily responsible for making the movie seem \"unlike other anime\". The theme song, \"Rain\", was written and composed by Senri Oe, and was originally a popular Japanese song in 1988. Shinkai enjoyed listening to Oe's song regularly while attending university, and since one of the film's themes was rain, it was the first song that came to mind while he worked on the production. He particularly liked the song because its lyrics reflected daily life, much like the film. The song was remade for the film in 2013, and sung by Motohiro Hata. Shinkai met Hata on several occasions and noted a similarity between Hata's passion as an artisan and that of the character Takao. Shinkai also felt that Hata's voice was perfect because to him it carried an \"underlying loneliness\" and \"sounded a little like an anxious young man\"."

        "content": "Two common themes among Shinkai's films, including The Garden of Words, are subtle romances and lingering emotions. However, this film's focus on \"lonely sadness\" (koi) was interpreted in a couple of ways. According to Cynthia Webb of The Jakarta Post, the loneliness is seen at the end of the film, when Takao learns to cope with Yukari's move to Shikoku. Luke Carroll at Anime News Network felt the end of the rainy season and the resulting separation created the sense of koi. Kaze of Beneath The Tangles, however, disagreed with these interpretations of koi and the notion that the story was a \"bittersweet romance\" or \"another love story\", and instead felt that the theme was unrecognized. Focusing instead on the human need for companionship and understanding, Kaze noted that both Takao and Yukari lacked meaningful connections with their peers and friends, a view shared by reviewer Bradly Halestorm at Hardcore Gamer. Together through their conversations\u2014in their \"garden of words\"\u2014they found companionship: Takao finding someone he can share his passion with, and Yukari finding someone who treats her as a person. However, because of the age difference, this discovery varied between the characters. For Yukari, an older and more experienced individual, her hopeless feelings of lonely sadness disappeared when she learned she could connect with Takao, a revelation that she saw as her salvation. For Takao, a boy with an unsupportive family and friends who seemed more like acquaintances, he did not realize his lack of companionship until he discovered it with Yukari, a new feeling he mistook for romantic love but only realized its true nature after she had moved away. According to Kaze, \"romantic love could potentially bloom from such feelings, but that is not what the story is about\". Instead, the love they shared was more basic, making the age difference immaterial. At the end of film, both characters maintained their friendship through letters, but otherwise began growing as people by moving on with their lives and presumably finding new relationships with other people. The hope was that one day they could reunite and renew their companionship \"without needing to cling to each other\". However, neither could \"learn to walk again\" if they continued to isolate themselves from the rest of the world and take shelter with each other in the garden at Shinjuku Gyoen. Another one of the themes discussed by the film's reviewers was rain or water. According to Cynthia Webb, the rain represented \"unfulfilled longing\", while Bradly Halestorm saw water as a third main character to the story, acting to both bring Takao and Yukari together and to symbolize the renewal of life. Kaze felt that the rain symbolized their lonely states, though also acknowledging Shinkai's statement that the rain symbolized uncontrollable love. Following the reasoning that rain symbolized their lonely states, Kaze noted that the tanka had not only romantic intentions, but was also a \"simple plea\" by Yukari for someone to stay with her, even when she's no longer lonely, and not just out of pity."

Scheduled for the end of the festival at 4:00\u00a0PM on April\u00a028,\u00a02013, the film was part of the 'Cool Japan' Gold Coast lineup and included a guest appearance and discussion with Shinkai. The film's premiere was hosted in Australia as a way of showing appreciation to Australians for their support. According to the GCFF's director, the film sold out in advance and was relocated to a larger theater. Despite feeling nervous about the world premiere, Shinkai provided a discussion of the film and asked everyone to not share the plot and story until after the Japanese release the following month. Shinkai was scheduled for an hour-long movie poster signing, but ended up staying two and a half hours to accommodate the high turnout. Following the world premiere, but ahead of the Japanese premiere on May 31, the first five minutes of the film were previewed on TV Tokyo and NTV on May\u00a012. On May\u00a022, it was announced on Shinkai's official Twitter account that the film would play in Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan at the same time and that the film would be available on iTunes on the day of the release. Additionally, the Japanese premiere would include a screening of Shinkai's short film, Dareka no Manazashi, which was released earlier that same year. By October, it was reported that many theaters in Japan had extended screening of the film. The official English language premiere of The Garden of Words was next shown in the United States at the Los Angeles Convention Center on July 6 and 7 as part of Anime Expo 2013. Sentai Filmworks hosted the film, and Shinkai was the Special Guest of Honor for the expo. The Canadian premiere was held at Montreal's 2013 Fantasia International Film Festival, where the film was screened on July 22 and 25. The film then returned to Australia when it screened alongside Ghost in the Shell: Arise at Madman Entertainment's Reel Anime 2013.

He also attended the UK premiere, which took place during Scotland Loves Anime 2013 in mid-October, where it was played in conjunction with Shinkai's earlier work, The Place Promised in Our Early Days. By late February\u00a02014, the film had been shown in 11\u00a0countries. In 2014, it was showcased at Amsterdam's Imagine Film Festival in mid-April, at the Stuttgart Festival of Animated Film in late-April, with Dareka no Manazashi on May\u00a021 in Italian theaters as part of the Nexo Anime project, and at the Japan Film Festival of San Francisco (JFFSF) in late-July."

        "content": "At Anime News Network, Luke Carroll praised the film, calling it a \"visual treat\", but was disappointed in the short length and found Shinkai's new coloring method to be distracting. Jon Hayward was impressed by the \"almost photo realistic\" quality of the scenery, particularly in Shinjuku Gyoen. The Managing Editor, Bamboo Dong, described it as \"beautifully designed and tenderly animated, it is nature eye candy at its finest.\" She was impressed by the film's unrushed yet thorough story despite its short length and praised both the music and art. In particular, she noted the beauty of the light reflections, rain scenes, and camera angles. At UK Anime Network, Andy Hanley gave it a score of 10/10, calling it \"visually beautiful with a touching story to match\". He praised the natural progression of their relationship, despite the age gap, and enjoyed the emotional climax of the film. Hanley felt that The Garden of Words had a \"tighter focus\" than Children Who Chase Lost Voices and a better ending than 5 Centimeters Per Second, concluding it was Shinkai's best work yet. Dan Rhodes called the film \"a real return to form for Makoto Shinkai\" following Children Who Chase Lost Voices, which he felt had been an attempt by Shinkai to live up to the common expectation of being the \"next Hayao Miyazaki.\" He praised the film for its beauty, romance, pacing, and subtlety. Although he felt that the film's ending was an improvement over the ending to 5 Centimeters Per Second, he described it as rushed and overly emotional. However, he was very critical of the English dub, which he felt adversely affected both content and mood. Bradly Halestorm at Hardcore Gamer gave it a 4.5 out of 5, describing it as \"painfully intimate and touchingly sentimental\" and \"the single most beautiful animated film ever created\". Despite the film's length, Storm was impressed that Shinkai was able to connect his audience with his characters faster and more effectively than full-length films. He worried that some viewers might miss the subtle message of the film and view it as a \"by-the-books love story that can feel clich\u00e9 or even trite\". Curtis Stone of Geekenstein gave it a 5 out of 5 and rated it #1 in his top five list of anime for 2013. He praised not only the art and music, but especially the voice acting, which he felt was perfect for the final scene. Lindsay Nelson at Midnight Eye compared the film to Whisper of the Heart by Studio Ghibli for its poetic use of \"seemingly bland and uninteresting locations\". She was impressed with both the sound and art, and particularly the sweeping view of the Docomo tower with the sunset in the background. However, she criticized it for its \"tearfully over-the-top climax\", \"treacly\" pop theme song, and lack of reflective silence. Andrew Hamlin at Northwest Asian Weekly gave it a 3.5 out of 4 stars, applauding its poetic use of nature while criticizing the film's brevity. Trung Rwo at Twitch Film also praised the artwork and felt the film displayed \"honest and fresh emotions\". He described it as \"clean and cute, a little bit cheesy\" due to the highly emotional ending. Sam at Otaku's Study gave the film an A-, describing it as an \"immersive love story\" and complimenting the Japanese voice acting and music. Allen Moody of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews praised the artwork and claimed it overshadowed the film's flaws, which he felt were its short length and underdeveloped story. Chris Beveridge at The Fandom Post praised the artwork, but felt that the story was weak, noting the simplicity of the plot, the abrupt ending, and the awkwardness of the age difference between the two main characters. Amy Wong, the editor at Yam, called it \"a story of solitude and heartache that comes before love.\" She praised the animation as its best feature, but also enjoyed its pace, though she saw the climax as overblown. Akumetsu at Anime e Manga thought the film could have been a masterpiece, but felt the plot was too straightforward, the film was too short, and the conclusion came too dramatically. Chris Beveridge at The Fandom Post reviewed the Blu-ray release, noting that the dialogue was \"clean and clear\" throughout the entire playback and described the high definition video as something worth showing off. He also felt the disc included a fair number of extras given the quick release. Matt Hinrichs at DVD Talk felt the video made a clean transfer from digital to Blu-ray, the atmospheric sound effects were \"carefully crafted\", and that the dialog in the center channel was clear. Dan Rhodes at UK Anime Network gave the DVD by Anime Limited a 9 out of 10, calling it a \"barebones release\", though praising its reversible insert. Serdar Yegulalp, of About.com Reviews, stated: \"A gorgeous short film designed to tug on the emotions as much as it fills the eyes.\""

Beginning in the spring of 1962, just after the close of the Algerian War and the \u00c9vian Accords, Marker and his cinematographer Pierre Lhomme shot 55 hours of footage interviewing people on the streets of Paris. The questions, asked by the unseen Marker, range from their personal lives to social and political issues of the day. As he had with montages of landscapes and indigenous art, Marker created a film essay that contrasts and juxtaposes a variety of lives with his signature commentary (spoken by Marker's friends, singer-actor Yves Montand in the French version and Simone Signoret in the English version). The film has been compared to the cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 films of Jean Rouch, and criticized by its practitioners at the time. It was shown in competition at the 1963 Venice Film Festival, where it won the award for Best First Work. It also won the Golden Dove Award at the Leipzig DOK Festival. Le Joli Mai was Marker's first project after he made the 1962 science fiction short La Jetee, perhaps his most famous film.

Moments later, the Blackwater Gang \u2013 Baptiste, Darko, Ramos, Snake, and Washington \u2013 arrive led by Red's half-brother Guerrero De La Cruz. After slaughtering everyone and freeing Red, they retreat. The next morning, Red tells them about Edendale, Colorado, where gold ore is being  stored in a bank until a mineral dispute can be settled. Guerrero agrees to steal it, so long as they avoid unnecessary deaths. After the seven rob the bank, Red betrays Guerrero, as he had acquired the deed to the mine and desires to take over the town. He shoots Guerrero, and despite Guerrero's orders, Red convinces the rest of the gang to turn on him; they all shoot Guerrero to death. Finding himself in Hell, Guerrero meets Lucifer, whom he had seen recently in his dreams. Guerrero bargains with him, to allow him to return to Earth and to kill his former gang, so that the fires of Hell can grow hotter than he alone can stoke with his flesh. Intrigued by this, Lucifer grants Guerrero 24 hours to slay all six of his betrayers or his soul will remain damned to Hell; Satan tells him that only Guerrero can kill the six, dissuading him from asking for help. Guerrero wakens one year to the day of his death and makes his way back to town now called \"Tombstone\" in his memory. Ramos, shaken by an omen earlier, returns to his home and witnesses two of his farmhands killed before confronting Guerrero, whom he could not immediately recognize. After Guerrero puts together his guns, a feat only  Red and he could accomplish, Ramos recognizes him, and he is shot to death. Taking his clothes, Guerrero has the local pastor set up six pine boxes as coffins and stations Ramos in one of them. The following morning, Baptiste and Darko discover Ramos and invade a nearby slaughterhouse. After a stand-off with Baptiste and his men, Guerrero kills Baptiste, but realizes that he still bleeds like a mortal. Darko tells Red about the stranger killing them off, and he sends Washington to the mine to insure that the man protecting them from the law is paid off in full. The gang goes to the saloon, where Guerrero is, and a firefight ensues. After defeating them, Guerrero sees the former sheriff's widow, Calathea, about to kill Red, and stops her, but he is trampled by Red's horse as he flees town. Waking sometime later, he explains to Father Paul and her about his situation. Showing him Darko's dead body, whom he had killed during the saloon brawl, Calathea agrees to help him, and the two make their way to the mine. In the mine,  Judah Clark, a marshal, is revealed to be aiding Red and protecting him for access to the gold. They leave Washington and Snake to finish off Guerrero, but he turns the tables and kills Washington as  Calathea and he escape back to town with his body. After an intense chase, they return to town. In a stand-off, Guerrero kills Snake with a gunshot to the eye, but he is quickly shot down and Calathea is captured. Lucifer, still intrigued by Guerrero's tenacity, returns him to life with one hour remaining on his deadline. After a mob tries to kill Red, he takes Calathea captive and confronts his brother, who convinces him to a fair duel. Lucifer cheats with seconds remaining on the clock, and Red and Guerrero instead battle by hand. Guerrero gains the upper hand and kills Red, but two minutes after his time is up. Entering the church, Lucifer informs Guerrero of his failure, but does not want to condemn him to Hell. Instead, he forces Guerrero to kill outlaws to pay off his debt. Now, with Edendale out of danger, Guerrero rides off into the countryside, looking for his next bounty to collect for Hell."

        "content": "Balaraju, the head of his village, lives with his wife Baby, their two sons; Chandrasekhar Rao and Bangari, and two daughters. He has Chandrasekhar become a doctor and builds a local hospital. On the day it is set to open, Chandrasekhar comes back home with his girlfriend Kausalya, also a doctor. Both express their wish to marry, which Balaraju agrees to. But, they also wish to settle in London, which upsets Balaraju, leading to the separation of the father and elder son. 25 years later, Chandrasekhar, a successful doctor in London, tells the story to his son Abhiram and daughter Indu. Abhiram decides to go home to Balaraju and attempt a reconciliation. He meets his friend, Bunny, at the airport and goes to his bike shop. Abhiram decides to stay for the night and leave the next day. At night, Bunny takes Abhiram to a pub, where they see a dancer and Abhi takes her photos. Abhi goes to the village on Bunny's bike the next day. On the way, he witnesses a cockfight organised by Bangari and Baachi; he gets the help of Balaraju to pardon Bangari and get Baachi arrested. Abhiram then introduces himself as a student from London who came here to learn agricultural practices and martial arts. He particularly impresses Balaraju's family when he saves a child's life and so is allowed to stay with them. Balaraju's granddaughter Satya comes back from Hyderabad. Abhiram is surprised to see Satya's cultured behaviour and traditional attire, as Bunny and Abhiram previously met her in a pub in Hyderabad. She is equally surprised to see him. Abhiram blackmails Satya with the photos, but she then asks Bangari to get Abhiram's cell phone by telling him that Abhiram is blackmailing her. Their collective efforts fail, and Baachi is also dragged into the affair. A fight happens between Abhiram and Baachi, deepening their rivalry. To get rid of Bangari, Balaraju arranges Chitra's marriage. Satya tells Bangari about this who then kidnaps Chitra. Abhiram chases him, saves Chitra and gets Bangari arrested. Satya finds Abhiram's phone and finds out his true identity. Abhiram offers to help Balaraju renovate the hospital he built with his father's assistance; Balaraju accepts the offer. Abhiram finds out that Satya has his phone when he goes to call his father. She deletes the photos of her. After learning that she knows the truth, Abhiram makes a deal with her. They fall in love with each other. Later, Chitra, now Abhiram's friend at the house, tells him why Bangari was expelled from the house. Bangari and Chitra love one another and Balaraju does not approve of it, as Bangari is rather spoilt and drinks too much. Frustrated and intoxicated, Bangari enters Chitra's room and tells her of his attempt to rape her so as to marry her. However, Balaraju expels him from the house after catching him. Balaraju's brother-in-law and his son, Rajendra, who plan to set up a Special economic zone manufacturing beer, release Bangari from jail. Abhiram's father sends the advanced equipment to Hyderabad, which Bunny and Bangari receive. Bangari attacks Bunny and seizes the equipment. Abhiram stops Bangari and his men and reveals his identity. Bangari realises what he has done and reconciles with Balaraju. The equipment is unloaded at the hospital. Indu too visits Balaraju's house. Satya gets engaged to an American NRI doctor. However, she tells Abhiram that she would die if she doesn't marry him. He decides to break up with her and upon hearing this, Bangari objects to the engagement and reveals Abhiram and Indu's identity to the family. When Baby is about to keep their true identities a secret among the rest of the family, Balaraju notices this, who orders Abhiram and Indu to leave the house. Later, Abhiram gets a phone call from his father who plans to come back to the village. Suddenly, Baachi kidnaps Indu. An injured Abhiram manages to save her, but gets shot by Baachi. Bangari arrives and Abhiram prevents Baachi from being harmed by saying that Baachi too is a family member. Chandrasekhar comes to the hospital and operates on Abhiram. When Abhiram regains consciousness, Balaraju welcomes him, Indu and then finally Chandrasekhar back into the family after he apologises. The film ends with Abhiram marrying Satya and Bangari to Chitra, also coinciding with Balaraju and Baby's anniversary."

        "content": "In September 2010, Chiranjeevi invited Krishna Vamsi to discuss making a movie with Ram Charan as the lead. After a story-narration session, they agreed to move ahead. In August 2013, after a three-year gap, it was announced that Ram Charan, Daggubati Venkatesh and Krishna would act in a film directed by Vamsi and produced by Bandla Ganesh under the banner Parameswara Art Productions banner. At that point, however, the script was not yet complete and so the project was still put on hold. In December 2013, Bandla Ganesh tweeted a photo featuring himself, Krishna Vamsi and Director of Photography Sameer Reddy at the Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple in Antarvedi with the finished script. The film was initially titled Vijetha after the 1985 Telugu film which featured Chiranjeevi and Bhanupriya in the lead roles. In March 2014, the supposed story of the film was leaked onto the internet. The story was that Ram Charan played the role of an NRI who visits his joint family to bridge a gap between his father and his father's younger brother. On 27 March 2014, when the film poster was released, the title was confirmed as Govindudu Andarivadele. In mid April 2014, Yuvan Shankar Raja was signed up as the film's composer after S. Thaman opted out because of conflicting projects. Sources reported that talks were also held with G. V. Prakash Kumar. It was the first time that Krishna Vamsi had collaborated with Yuvan Shankar Raja, with the director later informing that he had waited five years to work with the composer. Reports regarding Rajkiran being replaced by Prakash Raj because of Chiranjeevi and the altering of the original script, and that Prakash Raj was included to strengthen the Telugu cultural identity of the film were dismissed as rumours. The film's shoot was put on hold due to the climate at the shooting spot being unsuitable for children acting in the film rather than because of Chiranjeevi. Ram Charan, in an interview with The Hindu, said that Rajkiran was replaced with Prakash Raj as the sections involving the former ended up looking more like a Tamil film."

        "content": "Vamsi wanted to cast a popular actor as the protagonist to widen the film's appeal, and approached Ram Charan because of his relationship with him since Charan's childhood. Venkatesh and Krishna were initially set to play the lead roles along with Charan, with Venkatesh playing the role of Charan's paternal uncle. In September 2013, Kajal Aggarwal was signed to play opposite Charan. Actor Jagapati Babu turned down the role of Charan's father as he wanted to concentrate on antagonistic character roles. In November 2013, Tamil actor Rajkiran was chosen to play the role of Charan's grandfather, previously earmarked for Krishna. The producers also began searching for a new actress in the lead role. In December 2013, Venkatesh left the project and was subsequently replaced by Telugu actor Srikanth, saying that the role did not suit his image rather than any other dissatisfaction. Chandini Chowdary was rumoured to have been signed up as the female lead, but this proved not to be the case. Tamannaah was approached as well, but she had prior commitments in Aagadu and Baahubali. Kajal was finalised by the end of 2013 as Charan's heroine in this film, marking her return to Telugu Cinema after a brief hiatus. Kamalini Mukherjee was chosen by Krishna Vamsi in late January 2014 by Krishna Vamsi, mainly because of her appearance and her acting talent. A song from rock band \"The Tapes\" took seven to nine hours to film for a sequence in the film featuring Charan and Kajal. This was the band's first onscreen appearance. Vennela Kishore confirmed his presence in the film twice through his Twitter account. In the end of May 2014, Prakash Raj replaced Rajkiran as Ram Charan's grandfather. Vamsi said \"Raj Kiran was cast initially and I had doubts about this casting. After shooting a few scenes, I went to Chiranjeevi and he suggested, 'You can think of taking someone who can carry Telugu nativity.' He just made that suggestion, but that was when I replaced Raj Kiran with Prakash Raj\". He added that Chiranjeevi did not interfere in this decision. However, Chiranjeevi helped Vamsi and Raj reconcile their differences. Jayasudha and Rahman were signed for key roles. M. S. Narayana was selected to play a supporting role. Adarsh Balakrishna was selected to portray the film's antagonist, recommended by Srikanth to Vamsi."

He was depicted as the star player of a professional rugby league footballer at Hemel Hempstead. Charan grew a ponytail and appeared in traditional Telugu costume, wearing a dhoti for some scenes in the film, contrasting with the modern clothes he wore in previous films. He also learnt stick fighting skills for the film. Vamsi showed Charan a lot of family dramas, drove him to villages to help him understand the atmosphere and mindset of the people. According to Vamsi, Charan \"comes across as a shy and reserved guy but has a fun and family loving side to him\", which he tried to show onscreen. Srikanth played the role of Charan's younger paternal uncle and wore his hair long for the role. His costume was rustic in appearance. A still of him in costume was shown in the end of July 2014. His \"crucial role\" in the film was aggressive and rebellious. Kajal Aggarwal revealed one of her outfits in the film on 27 July 2014 would be a black half-sari. Jayasudha was selected to play the role of Prakash Raj's wife in the film while Rahman was signed in to play the role of Ram Charan's father. Kamalini Mukherjee's character was named Chitra, a rural girl quite unlike the urbane roles she had played in the past. Adarsh Balakrishna, cast as a flashy M. P.'s son living in the same village, wore jewellery with Indian costume, again with long hair."

Kajal joined the sets of the film in Hyderabad on 9 February 2014 and some scenes between herself and Charan were shot there. They also participated in the film's shoot at Nagercoil near Kanyakumari in mid February 2014 after the completion of the schedule at Rameswaram. A fight sequence with Charan, Srikanth and others was filmed at Kanyakumari before shifting to Pollachi. A few action sequences focusing Charan were shot at Pollachi in late March 2014. He also worked on some key action sequences for the film under the supervision of Ram Lakshman in mid May 2014, for which a special set was built. Some song sequences were shot in Malaysia from 2 June 2014. The film's shoot continued in Hyderabad from 5 June 2014 and the team planned to go to London after filming some family scenes at the special house set constructed earlier in Ramanaidu Cine Village in Hyderabad. 30 scenes and 2 songs were shot in that house set in Hyderabad over a period of 45 days. Prakash Raj allotted bulk dates and the reshoot took 8 days only and not 20 days as earlier reported. After completing the shoot of few scenes and a montage song, the first part of the film's Hyderabad schedule ended on 18 June 2014. The next part commenced on 21 June 2014. At the end of June 2014, another song was shot on a special set featuring mirrors, in which the lead pair participated. Due to incessant rain at Pollachi, the shooting continued at Hyderabad, delaying the planned schedule. The Pollachi schedule therefore began on 23 July 2014, lasting for 5 days. A fresh schedule began in Karaikudi on whose completion, filming continued in Hyderabad from 4 August 2014. The film's shoot was temporarily halted on 19 August 2014 because of the statewide survey in Telangana. The next schedule began in London on 22 August 2014. A romantic song was shot on Charan and Kajal in early September 2014 in Jordan. After its completion, a song was shot with the lead pair in London. The production unit returned to Hyderabad on 14 September 2014. A quarter of the film was shot in London. Charan's introduction scene was shot at the Pennine Way Stadium, and a rugby match was shot at the Rugby League club in Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire in south-eastern England. To add some authenticity, the local club captain B. J. Swindells was brought on board. Two songs sequences were shot simultaneously in Hyderabad. The principal photography ended on 22 September 2014 on completion of the songs shoot. However, it was officially announced later that the film would be released without a song which would be shot on 2 and 3 October and then be added to the film."

In an interview with the Deccan Chronicle, Chiranjeevi mentioned that Charan also participated in the production and editing of the film's trailer and took extra care of the trailer's release and had asked him to check if everything was right. While shooting two songs at Hyderabad, the post production works were completed. A copy of the film was sent to Central Board of Film Certification on 26 September 2014. The same day, the film was awarded an 'U/A' certificate instead of a clean 'U' due to some sections and scenes between the lead actors. The Board asked the makers to obtain a No Objection Certificate from Animal Welfare Board of India to retain scenes featuring animals. They muted a few dialogues as well as \"backless\" views of the heroine. They also insisted on obscuring the brands on alcoholic drinks as well as the display of mandatory warnings \"when Srikanth is smoking\"."

Haricharan Pudipeddi, writing for IANS, gave a mixed review saying, \"Govindudu Andarivadele displays Telugu filmmakers' reluctance to dig deep within a genre. There's enough material readily available from our own lives for an engaging family tale, but rarely do we come across anything realistic.\" and gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5."

Noni is happy to win second place for her performance of Nina Simone's \"Blackbird\", but her mother refuses to accept anything but first place and forces Noni to smash her trophy on the ground. In the present, Noni Jean is a hot new artist who has just won a Billboard Music Award for her collaboration with her boyfriend Kid Culprit and is primed for superstardom. However, the pressures of success cause her to nearly end her life by falling off a hotel balcony. She is saved by a young police officer, Kaz Nicol. Noni's team, including her mother, tells the media in a press conference that she fell by accident. Kaz, who has political ambitions, is not happy to be forced to lie to the media, and is initially cold to Noni. However, he later apologizes to her. Gradually, they connect and begin to fall in love, despite her mother's disapproval. Noni tells Kaz about the songs she has secretly written, and he is supportive of her creative ambitions. Noni decides to end the romantic relationship with Kid Culprit that her team has encouraged. In spite of her team's attempt to cover it up, rumors persist that Noni attempted suicide, and her label tells Macy (who is also Noni's manager) that her record contract is conditional on a successful upcoming performance. However, during the performance, Kid Culprit suddenly humiliates her and lies about their relationship, and Kaz punches him on stage in defense of Noni. Following this, Noni loses her record contract and is at a low point emotionally, so Kaz takes her on a trip to Mexico away from the spotlight where they enjoy each other's company. Noni gets rid of her old hairstyle in favor of her natural hair, and a trip to a local karaoke bar leads to Noni giving an emotional performance of \"Blackbird.\" The performance is uploaded to the internet and goes viral, causing Noni's mother and the paparazzi to find her. Macy tells Noni that the viral success of her performance has caused her record label to reconsider, and Noni agrees to return home. Kaz tells Noni he is not convinced that anything will be different than it was before, and their relationship is put on pause. Noni wants to add a song she has written to her upcoming album, but Macy refuses. The two fight about their relationship and Noni tells her mother that even after her suicide attempt, Macy continued to focus only on her career to the detriment of her happiness and mental health. Noni fires Macy as her manager. Meanwhile, Kaz has begun a political campaign and reflects on whether his career should take precedence over his personal happiness. Inspired by Kaz's honesty, Noni gives a television interview where she admits to having attempted suicide and says she is getting help. Noni prepares for her first live performance in London, and shortly before going onstage suddenly encounters Kaz, who has taken a flight there and expresses his love for her. Noni performs a song she has written to an enthusiastic audience. She brings Kaz onstage, tells him that she loves him too, and they embrace."

She stated that she accepted to be a part of the film only due to her good relationship with Bellamkonda Suresh when he helped her during the time when she was suffering with serious skin ailments. She said \"Bellamkonda Suresh has stood by me during the toughest phase in my life and I am doing this film for him.\" A photo shoot was conducted later on Samantha and Sai Sreenivas in the same month.

She too confirmed the news that she is sharing the screen along with a debutante hero. But since the previous two scripts were not accepted by Vinayak himself and after penning a fresh script, Tamannaah was no more a part of the film as the new one required a single heroine only. In the end of January 2014, Prakash Raj reacted in his Twitter about the speculations that he would play a double role in Mahesh Babu's Aagadu that he is not playing a dual role in that film but he is playing a dual role in this film which he called an \"interesting\" one. In the end of March 2014, it was reported that Tamannaah would do a special song in the film. It was said that she would participate in the shoot for this song in the end of April 2014 or early May 2014. It was also said that the song would be the introduction song of the hero in the film. But by the time the reports emerged into the media, Tamannaah wrapped up the shoot of the song in the film on 31 March and V. V. Vinayak thanked her for accepting the offer in his Facebook page. The song, a romantic one, was shot in Hyderabad in a vineyard set for five days. In an interaction to Chennai Times, Tamannaah's father said \"The primary reason why she agreed to do this song was because it is the most important song in the film. It is not an item song but a romantic number and the director narrated how he intends to shoot it. It is true that a year ago, when the script was first written, Tamannaah had chosen to be a part of this film. However, when the script was changed, we mutually agreed to part ways. But despite that, both Tamannaah and Vinayak have mutual respect for each other and that is why, when Vinayak requested Tamannaah to do this one song for him, she agreed.\" About his character, Brahmanandam spoke \"I played Dimple in this film and it is a very different character from my previous films. Prakash Raj played a dual role in this film and I played an assistant to one of his characters. But I get confused with both of them and talk about one with the other.

Turner travels, paints, stays with the country aristocracy, visits a brothel, is a popular if anarchic member of the Royal Academy of Arts, has himself strapped to the mast of a ship so that he can paint a snowstorm, and is both celebrated and reviled by the public and by royalty. The story recreates the memorable occasion during the Royal Academy salon of 1832 when Turner's seascape Helvoetsluys was placed next to Constable's The Opening of Waterloo Bridge seen from Whitehall. Seeing how the muted tones of his own painting paled next to Constable's vibrant work, in a quick stroke Turner adds a smear of red paint representing a buoy.

        "content": "Mr. Turner received wide praise from critics. Spall's performance was lauded, along with Yershon's score and Pope's cinematography. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a \"Certified Fresh\" rating of 97%, based on 193 reviews, with an average score of 8.40/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Led by a masterful performance from Timothy Spall and brilliantly directed by Mike Leigh, Mr. Turner is a superior Hollywood biopic.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 94 out of 100 based on 44 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Critic Katie Kilkenny of The Atlantic called it \"a gorgeous, important film\". Observer critic Mark Kermode described the film as a \"portrait of a man wrestling light with his hands as if it were a physical element: tangible, malleable, corporeal\". Slate reviewer Dana Stevens wrote, \"Writing about Mr. Turner a few weeks after seeing it, I feel a craving to be again immersed in its world, which is rich with colors, textures, and, it sometimes almost seems, smells\". The consonance between the film and its subject was addressed by Sir Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate Galleries in England: \u201cMike Leigh and Timothy Spall\u2019s great achievement is showing us how the artist approached the physical business of painting. But they also convey the spirit of a man whose reputation as a curmudgeon is unwarranted, given his passionate interest in people and the world around him. There is a great humanitarian streak in Turner and Mike Leigh has found a way of capturing this on film, as he has done so often before.\u201d Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film three and a half out of four stars, writing that like Leigh's 1999 film Topsy-Turvy, about the creation of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Mikado, \"[Mr. Turner] understands creative people on every conceivable level, and translates that understanding with a deftness rarely seen outside of astute documentaries about creative people. To watch it is to feel as though you're a part of its world... experiencing tiny fluctuations in received wisdom and sudden changes of artistic direction that can only be sensed by professionals who are plugged into their art form, and completely in command of their talents.\""

        "content": "The Solaiyur Dam, which is the lifeline of the village Solaiyur, is under assessment for structural integrity. The dam inspector is ordered to report that the dam is unfit to remain, by the corrupt local MP Nagabhushan, who wants the dam demolished for his own benefit. When the former refuses, Nagabhushan stabs him to death. The dying man throws a pen drive (disguised as a rudraksha) containing the details certifying the dam's integrity, into an abandoned Shiva temple near the dam and warns the village head Karunakaran, who arrives upon hearing his cries, that the temple has to be opened as soon as possible, before dying. Karunakaran firmly believes that the temple can only be opened by the descendant of Raja Lingeshwaran, an erstwhile king who built the dam as well as the temple. Lakshmi, the granddaughter of Karunakaran and a journalist, embarks on a search to find the descendant. She soon discovers the person - Lingeswaran aka Lingaa. Lingaa, the grandson of Raja Lingeshwaran, is a witty thief, living in poverty. He bears a grudge against his grandfather, firmly believing his \"squandering nature\" as the root cause of his poverty. Consequently, he refuses to accompany Lakshmi to Solaiyur. Undeterred, Lakshmi follows Lingaa and records his gang's act of stealing a priceless necklace and implicates them, thus forcing him to accompany her to Solaiyur. At Solaiyur, Lingaa receives a warm welcome from the villagers. Later, Karunakaran privately tells Lingaa that the Lingam installed at the Shiva temple is made of Maragatham stone, an extremely valuable artifact. At midnight, he infiltrates the Shiva temple with the intention to steal the Lingam. Unfortunately, he is noticed by one of the dam's security guards, who immediately alerts the villagers. Aware of their presence, Lingaa quickly and wittingly changes his act to an appearance of performing a pooja, thus fooling the villagers.  A relieved Karunakaran then narrates the true story of Lingaa's heritage. Raja Lingeshwaran, the ruler of the erstwhile princely state of Kodiyur, is shown to be a civil services officer and the collector of Madurai district. Upon surveying the village of Solaiyur, he receives complaints from the local villagers, stating that they have no water for nine months per year, while facing raging floods for the other three months - which has led to recurring and devastaing famines. Determined to help, he petitions to construct a dam, for the benefit of Solaiyur. However, his plan is rejected at the annual collectors' meeting and he is instead forced to approve another infrastructure project. He refuses to do so and is blackmailed of being dismissed for his non-compliance. In defiance, Lingeshwaran resigns from his position. Later, several members of the Indian royalty and British officers congregate to celebrate Lingeshwaran's birthday. Among them is Collector Lawrence Hunter, the officer who had opposed Raja Lingeshwaran's plan. He is shocked to discover Lingeshwaran's real identity. Over dinner, Lingeshwaran notifies the British Governor of his resignation and expresses his wish to construct a dam at Solaiyur, with his own capital. He requests an approval from the British Government, which is granted. The Collector challenges Raja Lingeshwaran that he will never finish building the dam. Though Lingeshwaran faces multiple difficulties and a near stoppage of work due to caste issues (which were ignited by Sambandam, a local resident shown to be working as a spy), the dam is constructed with the help of the villagers, who turn out to be very co-operative with Lingeshwaran. Bharathi, the daughter of a senior villager falls in love with Raja Lingeshwaran. Finally, the dam is almost complete, except for the shaft doors. The doors are found to be held in the collector's possession. With the floods soon to occur, Lingeshwaran negotiates with the collector and tries to persuade him to give in. As a dirty trick, the latter proposes that if the shaft doors are to be handed over, Lingeshwaran must hand over the villagers' land as bribe and the credit for constructing the dam, to which he reluctantly agrees. Sambandam discreetly brings the villagers to the collector's residence at the same time and tricks them into believing that Lingeshwaran is a puppet of the British, thus manipulating them. After the dam's completion, the infuriated villagers reprimands Lingeshwaran for his \"malicious actions\" and banishes him from Solaiyur, despite Bharati's protests. Fully knowing the double-play behind him, Lingeshwaran leaves and is later accompanied by Bharati. The collector's wife, Jenny, disgusted at her husband's behaviour, angrily reveals to the villagers that they have been double-crossed and reveals the real terms that Lingeshwaran had agreed to. The villagers, upon realizing their double play, pursue Sambandam, who commits suicide out of guilt. Jenny decides to leave with her daughter, but is stopped by her husband, having realized his folly. Upon her insistence, he publicly declares that the dam was constructed by  Lingeshwaran. After a long search, the villagers find him and Bharathi, now his wife, living in poverty. After unsuccessfully trying to convince him to return to Solaiyur, the villagers resolve to keep the Shiva temple (which he had built), closed until the Raja or his descendants return to the village. Lingaa, on hearing his grandfather's story, changes his opinion about his grandfather and decides to mend his ways. In the present, Karunakaran reveals that his invitation to Lingaa was merely a ruse, as he believes that danger is afoot; recalling the fate of the dam inspector. At a function, Nagabhushan reveals to an accomplice that he plans to drill small holes into the dam, which would be filled with explosives; when triggered, would destroy the dam. Lakshmi secretly records Nagabhushan this conversation (with the help of a spy camera) and plays it before the entire town, exposing Nagabhushan. Lingaa then reveals that he had already discovered the pen drive and had the dam's certificate approved, copied and spread throughout the Internet; ultimately culminating into Nagabhushan being ousted from his position. Enraged, he kidnaps Lakshmi and escapes in a hot air balloon. Having a bomb with him, he plans to detonate it over the dam, in order to spite Lingaa. Lingaa pursues him on a bike and drives it over a ledge at the exact time Nagabhushan's balloon appears on it, landing on top of it; he manages to climb into the carriage. After an ensuing fight, he kicks Nagabhushan out, who plunges to his death in the water below and kicks the bomb into the reservoir, which explodes moments later, thus saving the dam. With his work done, Lingaa plans to leave. However, the police finally catch up to him, demanding that he testify for an inquiry (about his recent jewel heist). Just before leaving, they are joined by Lakshmi, having fallen in love with Lingaa."

The muhurat shot of the movie was filmed in May 2014 at the Chamundeshwari Temple in Mysuru. Cinematographer R. Rathnavelu revealed that filming would be done using a Red Dragon 6K camera. In addition to this, the Phantom Flex 4K camera was used for filming action sequences. The film crew shot in various locations in Karnataka like Melukote, Manuvana, Pandavapura, Chamundi Hills and inside the residential portion of Mysore Palace. On 10 May 2014, Sonakshi had completed her portions for the first schedule of the film's shooting. On 18 May 2014, Rajinikanth and Sonakshi Sinha shot some scenes dating back to the British era in front of the illuminated residential portion of the palace. Horses were used for the shot. Over 50 policemen and 30 bouncers had been deployed to prevent people from getting near the shooting area in Mysore. The team then moved to Ramoji Film City, Hyderabad for a two-month schedule, where sequences featuring the entire cast were shot for 50 days. A song sequence featuring Rajinikanth and Anushka was shot at Annapurna Studios, wherein the production team had designed a huge set for the song. On 13 July 2014, actress Sonakshi Sinha completed her filming schedule in Hyderabad. The Hyderabad schedule ended on 30 July 2014. During the Hyderabad schedule of the film, news circulated that Rajinikanth fainted on the sets while filming a heavy action sequence but Ravikumar denied this, citing that the actor was healthy. In early August 2014, the team shot some scenes near the Radisson Hotel in Chennai, with Anushka Shetty in the frame. In mid-August 2014, the production unit confirmed that 80% of the filming was completed. Filming then moved to Thirthahalli and the Jog Falls, where some important scenes were canned for twenty-five days. For the film's climax, a big statue of Lord Shiva and dam both as set were constructed next to the Jog water-falls. Shooting also took place at the Linganamakki Dam. The film's climax requirements accounted for . In September 2014, the climax portion's filming was allotted ten days, confirming the shoot in Karnataka. On 22 September 2014, Whittaker confirmed that the climax portions of the film were completed with a stunt sequence choreographed by him. The film's shooting was wrapped up by 23 September 2014 except filming of two song sequences that were reported to be canned in Chennai and Scotland. Ravikumar stated that the climax scene, which involved a hot air balloon, was inspired by a sequence Armour of God (1986). During the Hyderabad schedule of the film, some villagers of Anajpur village in Rangareddy district in Telangana had tried to halt the shooting of Lingaa, stating that some chemicals were mixed in the nearby lake during shoots, polluting local water. But the crew members stated that they had sought the permission of the irrigation department and the village Panchayat for shooting. The crew members also dismissed allegations of chemicals in the lake. During the shooting of the climax portions near the Linganamakki Dam, environmental organisations opposed the permission granted to the production unit for shooting, suggesting a threat to the location as public entry to the dam was prohibited. The organisations also had sent a petition to both the Deputy Collector's office and the Deputy Commissioner's office, who in turn, sent the petition to the Chief Minister of Karnataka, Siddaramaiah, for scrutinity. Regarding the same issue, officials of the Karnataka State Police Board also sent a letter to the Chief Minister asking him to end the shooting of the portions of the film there, citing that the bio-diversity and life in and around the dam would be affected. The elephants featured in the film were constructed through CGI, and a disclaimer was issued for this at the beginning of the film."

Tarantino announced the film in November 2013. He conceived it as a novel and sequel to his 2012 film Django Unchained before deciding to make it a standalone film. After the script leaked in January 2014, he canceled the film and instead directed a live reading at the United Artists Theater in Los Angeles, before reconsidering and resuming progress on the project. Filming began on December 8, 2014, near Telluride, Colorado. Italian composer Ennio Morricone composed the original score, his first complete Western score in thirty-four years (and the last before his death in 2020), his first for a high-profile Hollywood production since Brian De Palma's Mission to Mars, and the first and only original score for a Tarantino film. Distributed by The Weinstein Company in the United States, The Hateful Eight was released on December 25, 2015, in a limited roadshow release on 70 mm film, before expanding wide theatrically on December 30, 2015. It received polarized reviews from critics, particularly for the performances of the cast and Morricone's score, though the depiction of race relations and the violent treatment of Leigh's character divided opinions. It has grossed over $156 million. For his work on the score, Morricone won his first and only Academy Award for Best Original Score, as well as the Golden Globe. The film also earned Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Leigh) and Best Cinematography (Robert Richardson). On April 25, 2019, the film was released as a re-edited four-episode miniseries on Netflix with the subtitle Extended Version. The Hateful Eight is Tarantino's final collaboration with The Weinstein Company following allegations of sexual abuse against Harvey Weinstein in October 2017."

        "content": "In 1877, bounty hunter and Civil War veteran Major Marquis Warren is heading to Red Rock, Wyoming, with three bounty corpses. His horse gives out, and faced with an incoming blizzard, Warren hitches a ride on a stagecoach driven by O.B. The other passengers are bounty hunter John Ruth, handcuffed to fugitive Daisy Domergue, who he is taking to Red Rock to be hanged. Despite his suspicions of Warren, Ruth is swayed by Warren's personal letter from Abraham Lincoln. They come across Lost-Causer Chris Mannix, who identifies himself as Red Rock's new sheriff. Confident that a racist former Confederate militiaman such as Mannix and an African-American Union veteran such as Warren would never conspire to take his bounty, Ruth strikes a mutual protection deal with Warren and allows Mannix aboard. During the trip, Ruth learns from Mannix, Domergue, and Warren about the hefty Confederate bounty placed on Warren for breaking out of and setting fire to a prisoner-of-war camp in West Virginia. The travellers seek refuge from the blizzard at Minnie's Haberdashery lodge. Greeting them is Bob, a Mexican who says Minnie is away and left him in charge. Other lodgers are Red Rock's hangman, Oswaldo Mobray; cowboy Joe Gage; and Confederate general Sanford Smithers, traveling to erect a cenotaph for his disappeared son. Suspicious, Ruth disarms all but Warren. Mannix surmises, and Warren concedes, that the Lincoln letter is false. Warren responds to Ruth's disappointment by saying his forged letter buys him leeway with whites. Warren leaves a gun next to Smithers and provokes him by claiming that years earlier he had ambushed, raped, and murdered Smithers' son, who had come to Wyoming to claim the Confederate bounty on Warren. When Smithers reaches for the gun, Warren shoots him dead in revenge for executing black prisoners of war at the battle of Baton Rouge. At the same time, Daisy witnesses someone poisoning the coffee. Ruth and O.B. drink it and die, but Ruth lives long enough to attack Daisy, who then shoots him with his own gun. Warren disarms Domergue, leaving her shackled to Ruth, and holds the others at gunpoint. He is joined by Mannix, whom Warren trusts because he nearly drank the poisoned coffee. Examining the evidence, and revealing Minnie's hatred of Mexicans, Warren deduces that Bob had been lying and thus had a part in the owners' deaths, and promptly executes him. When Warren threatens to kill Daisy, Gage admits he poisoned the coffee. An unknown man hiding under the floorboards shoots through them, hitting Warren in the groin. Mobray draws a hidden gun and shoots Mannix, who returns fire, wounding Mobray. A flashback shows Bob, Mobray, Gage, and Daisy's brother Jody arriving at the lodge hours earlier. They murder Minnie and five others, leaving only Smithers. Gang leader Jody tells Smithers they plan to rescue Domergue, and will spare him if he keeps quiet. They dispose of the bodies and hide the evidence. As Ruth's stagecoach arrives, Jody hides in the cellar. In the present, Mannix and Warren, both seriously wounded, hold Daisy, Gage, and Mobray at gunpoint. When they threaten to kill Daisy, Jody surrenders. Much to her horror, he is executed by Warren in retribution for the groin shot. The gang's true identities are revealed, and they offer Mannix a deal. They claim fifteen of Jody's men are waiting in Red Rock in case the rescue at Minnie's fails. If Mannix kills Warren, they will spare him and allow him to collect the bounty on the mortally-wounded Mobray. Warren shoots and kills Mobray. Gage draws a revolver, but is shot dead by both Mannix and Warren. Warren tries to shoot Daisy, but is out of bullets. He asks Mannix for his gun, but Mannix refuses, giving Daisy more time to elaborate on her deal. She does, but her pitch fails to convince Mannix, who does not believe her claims and threats. While berating Daisy for trying to outsmart him, Mannix faints from blood loss. While Warren watches helplessly, Daisy frees herself by hacking off Ruth's arm. When she goes for a gun Mannix regains consciousness and shoots her. As Mannix aims for the killing shot, Warren persuades him to hang her in honor of Ruth, who was known as \"The Hangman\" for always bringing his bounties in alive to the gallows. The two wounded men succeed in stringing Daisy from the rafters. Afterwards, as they lie dying, Mannix reads aloud Warren's Lincoln letter, complimenting his attention to detail."

He initially attempted the story as a novel, a sequel to his film Django Unchained titled Django in White Hell, but realized that the Django character did not fit the story. On January 12, 2014, the title was announced as The Hateful Eight. The film was inspired by the 1960s Western TV series Bonanza, The Virginian, and The High Chaparral. Tarantino said: Production would most likely have begun in mid-2014, but after the script leaked online in January 2014, Tarantino considered publishing it as a novel instead. He said he had given the script to a few trusted colleagues, including Reginald Hudlin, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern, and Tim Roth. This version of the script featured a different ending in which Warren and Mannix attempt to kill Gage in revenge by forcing him to drink the poisoned coffee, sparking a firefight in which every character is killed. Tarantino described his vision for the character of Daisy Domergue as a \"Susan Atkins of the Wild West\". Madsen based Joe Gage on Peter Breck's performance in The Big Valley. On April 19, 2014, Tarantino directed a live reading of the leaked script at the United Artists Theater in the Ace Hotel Los Angeles. The event was organized by the Film Independent at Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) as part of the Live Read series and was introduced by Elvis Mitchell. Tarantino explained that they would read the first draft of the script, and he added that he was writing two new drafts with a different ending. The actors who joined Tarantino included Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Amber Tamblyn, James Parks, Walton Goggins, Zo\u00eb Bell, James Remar, Dana Gourrier, Dern, Roth, and Madsen."

In the earlier public reading of the first script, the role of Daisy Domergue had been read by Amber Tamblyn, and the role of Bob, a Frenchman rather than a Mexican, was read by Denis M\u00e9nochet; at the reading, the role of Jody was read by James Remar. Regarding the cast, Tarantino has said, \"This is a movie where [bigger movie stars] wouldn't work. It needs to be an ensemble where nobody is more important than anybody else.\""

The film was transferred to 70\u00a0mm film for projection using Ultra Panavision 70 and Kodak Vision 3 film stocks: 5219, 5207, 5213 and 5203. Until the release of Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk two years later, it was the widest release in 70\u00a0mm film since Ron Howard's Far and Away in 1992. The film uses Panavision anamorphic lenses with an aspect ratio of 2.76:1, a very widescreen image that was used on some films in the 1950s and 1960s. The filmmakers also avoided any use of a digital intermediate in the 70mm roadshow release, which was color-timed photochemically by FotoKem, and the dailies were screened in 70mm. The wide digital release and a handful of 35mm prints were struck from a digital intermediate, done by Yvan Lucas at Shed/Santa Monica."

Tarantino had previously used Morricone's music in Kill Bill, Death Proof, Inglourious Basterds, and Django Unchained, and Morricone also wrote an original song, \"Ancora Qui\", for the latter. Morricone had previously made statements that he would \"never work\" with Tarantino after Django Unchained, but ultimately changed his mind and agreed to score The Hateful Eight. According to Variety, Morricone composed the score without even seeing the film. The soundtrack was announced on November 19, 2015, for a December 18 release from Decca Records. Ennio Morricone composed 50 minutes of original music for The Hateful Eight. In addition to Morricone's original score, the soundtrack includes dialogue excerpts from the film, \"Apple Blossom\" by The White Stripes from their De Stijl album, \"Now You're All Alone\" by David Hess from The Last House on the Left and \"There Won't Be Many Coming Home\" by Roy Orbison from The Fastest Guitar Alive. Tarantino confirmed that the film would use three unused tracks from Morricone's original soundtrack for the 1982 John Carpenter film The Thing\u2014\"Eternity\", \"Bestiality\", and \"Despair\"\u2014as Morricone was pressed for time while creating the score. The final film also uses Morricone's \"Regan's Theme\" from the 1977 John Boorman film Exorcist II: The Heretic. Morricone's score won several awards, including a special award from New York Film Critics Circle. The score won a Golden Globe for Best Original Score. It also took the 2016 Academy Award for Best Motion Picture Score, Morricone's first after several career nominations. The acoustic song played by Leigh's character Domergue on a Martin guitar is the traditional Australian folk ballad \"Jim Jones at Botany Bay\", which dates from the early 19th century and was first published by Charles McAlister in 1907. The rendition in the film includes lines which were not in MacAlister's version. The film's trailer used Welshly Arms' cover of \"Hold On, I'm Coming\", although this is not used in the film itself."

TWC would sell the film worldwide, but Tarantino asked to personally approve the global distributors for the film. In preparation for its release, Tarantino arranged for approximately 100 theaters worldwide to be retrofitted with anamorphic equipped 70 mm film projectors, in order to display the film as he intended. The film was released on December 25, 2015, as a roadshow presentation in 70\u00a0mm film format theaters. The film was initially scheduled to be released in digital theaters on January 8, 2016. On December 14, The Hollywood Reporter announced that the film would see wide release on December 31, 2015, while still screening the 70\u00a0mm version. The release date was moved to December 30, 2015, to meet demand. On July 11, 2015, Tarantino and the cast of the film appeared at San Diego Comic-Con to promote the film. In the UK, where the film was distributed by Entertainment Film Distributors, the sole 70mm print in the country opened at the Odeon Leicester Square on January 8 in a roadshow presentation, with the digital general release version opening the same day at other cinemas, except Cineworld, who refused to book the film after failing to reach an agreement to show the 70mm print. On March 15, 2016, The Hateful Eight was released in the United States on Digital HD, and on Blu-ray and DVD on March 29, 2016. On December 20, 2015, screener copies of The Hateful Eight and numerous other Oscar contenders, including Carol, The Revenant, Brooklyn, Creed, and Straight Outta Compton, were uploaded to many websites. The FBI linked the case to co-CEO Andrew Kosove of Alcon Entertainment. Kosove responded that he had \"never seen this DVD\", and that \"it never touched his hands.\" In April 2019, the streaming service Netflix released an extended miniseries version of the film, split into four episodes."

Its critical consensus reads, \"The Hateful Eight offers another well-aimed round from Quentin Tarantino's signature blend of action, humor, and over-the-top violence \u2013 all while demonstrating an even stronger grip on his filmmaking craft.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned The Hateful Eight a score of 68 out of 100 based on 51 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported audiences gave it a 42% \"definite recommend\". James Berardinelli wrote that The Hateful Eight \"is a high-wire thriller, full of masterfully executed twists, captivating dialogue, and a wildly entertaining narrative that gallops along at a pace to make three hours evaporate in an instant. Best film of the year? Yes.\" Telegraph critic Robbie Collin wrote: \"The Hateful Eight is a parlour-room epic, an entire nation in a single room, a film steeped in its own filminess but at the same time vital, riveting and real. Only Tarantino can do this, and he\u2019s done it again.\" The Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw gave the film five out of five, and wrote that it was \"intimate yet somehow weirdly colossal, once again releasing [Tarantino's] own kind of unwholesome crazy-funny-violent nitrous oxide into the cinema auditorium for us all to inhale ... \"Thriller\" is a generic label which has lost its force. But The Hateful Eight thrills.\" A.V. Club critic Ignatiy Vishnevetsky gave the film a grade of A- and wrote that \"with a script that could easily be a stage play, The Hateful Eight is about as close as this pastiche artist is likely to get to the classical tradition.\" In contrast, Owen Gleiberman of the BBC said, \"I'm not alone in thinking that it's Tarantino's worst film \u2013 a sluggish, unimaginative dud, brimming with venom but not much cleverness.\" Donald Clarke, writing in The Irish Times, wrote, \"What a shame the piece is so lacking in character and narrative coherence. What a shame so much of it is so gosh-darn boring.\" A. O. Scott in The New York Times said, \"Some of the film's ugliness...seems dumb and ill-considered, as if Mr. Tarantino's intellectual ambition and his storytelling discipline had failed him at the same time.\" Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film's production design, idiosyncratic dialogue, and \"lip-smackingly delicious\" performances, but felt the film was overlong and that Morricone's score was put to too limited use. Scholars Florian Zitzelsberger and Sarah E. Beyvers observe that the film follows Aristotle's unities: \"Tarantino's film meticulously adheres to the classical unities of a tragedy, which had been seen as a necessity for the audience's immersion for a long time: 'The Hateful Eight' follows only one plot (unity of action), it is limited to a time period of 24 hours (unity of time).\" Hollis Robbins argues that The Hateful Eight is a panoramic Western chamber drama: \"Tarantino's eighth film demands to be seen not as a revisionist but a newly visioned western, using the mythmaker's tools to offer a panoramic vision of racial sovereignty undone by random violence.\""

A. O. Scott felt the film \"mutates from an exploration of racial animus into an orgy of elaborately justified misogyny\". Laura Bogart regarded the treatment of Daisy Domergue as a \"betrayal\" of the positive female characters in previous Tarantino films, such as Kill Bill. Juliette Peers wrote that \"compared to the stunning twists and inversions of norms that Tarantino's other works offer when presenting female characters, The Hateful Eight'''s sexual politics seem bleakly conservative. Daisy is feisty and highly intelligent, yet the plotline is arbitrarily stacked against her.\" Conversely, Courtney Bissonette of Bust praised Tarantino's history of female characters and wrote of Domergue's treatment: \"This is equality, man, and it's more feminist to think that a criminal is getting treated the same despite her sex. They don't treat her like a fairy princess because she is a woman, they treat her like a killer because she is a killer.\" Sophie Besl of Bitch Flicks argued that Domergue received no special treatment as a woman, is never sexually objectified, and has agency over her own actions (including killing her captor). She defended the hanging scene as in the filmic tradition of villains \"getting what's coming to [them]\", and that equivalent scenes with male villains in previous Tarantino films raised no objections. However, Matthew Stogdon felt that as Domergue's crimes are not explained, her status as a criminal deserving execution is not established, breaking the narrative rule of \"show, don't tell\". Walton Goggins described the two survivors cooperating in the hanging as symbolic of a positive step to erase racism: \"I see it as very uplifting, as very hopeful, and as a big step in the right direction, as a celebration, as a changing of one heart and one mind.\" However, Sasha Stone, writing for Awards Daily, felt it was implausible for Domergue to \"represent, somehow, all of the evil of the South, all of the racism, all of the injustice. She's a tiny thing. There is no point in the film, or maybe one just barely, when Daisy inflicts any violence upon anyone \u2013 and by then it could be argued that she is only desperately trying to defend herself. She is handcuffed to Kurt Russell, needing his permission to speak and eat, and then punched brutally in the face whenever she says anything.\" Tarantino intended the violence against Domergue to be shocking and wanted the audience's allegiances to shift during the story. He said: \"Violence is hanging over every one of those characters like a cloak of night. So I'm not going to go, 'OK, that's the case for seven of the characters, but because one is a woman, I have to treat her differently.' I'm not going to do that.\""

Canuto, written by Canuto and Xu Xiaoxi, and starring Kylan James, Kjord Davis, Diana Grivas, Alexander Aguila, and Alexandra Smothers. The film was screened at over thirty international film festivals, mainly those with a LGBT theme, winning awards including best film. It is considered a cult film in many circles,  becoming a classic in underground Gay Cinema after many screenings around the world. Toto Forever is a fable in which feelings and emotions are always fully exposed, with a very poetic and symbolic narrative, and an aesthetic strongly influenced by the Yaoi (\"Boys Love\") Japanese anime. The film tells the love story of Toto, a hopeful young postman who dreams of starting a new life, and Mark, a gangster, who is in deep trouble with a mafia group. The film premiered at the 2010 Kashish Mumbai International Film Festival, the first LGBT festival in India organised after a Delhi High Court ruling decriminalised homosexual intercourse between consenting adults. Toto Forever was at the opening ceremony, and was the first film screened at the event. Canuto was also invited to screen the film at the opening ceremonies in Panama at the 3rd LesGayCinePTY, the most important gay film event in the country, where it won the best film award. At the South Asian premiere, at Indonesia's Q! Film Festival in Jakarta, there were serious incidents at some of the screenings when radical Muslim demonstrators from the Islamic Defenders Front, and groups of extremists from the Indonesian University, attended the venue with weapons and threatened to set fire to the theatre if the film was screened. Toto Forever was screened in many other venues around the world, receiving other accolades like the nomination for best cinematography at the 2009 Kodak Scholarship awards in the United States."

Canuto, shot the film as a graduation project at the New York Film Academy (NYFA) at  Universal Studios in Hollywood, but he finished the post-production work after graduation, including adding music by Andrea Centazzo. The film was the first collaboration between the director and the composer, one which was repeated in their next films together - Desire Street and Ni Jing: Thou Shalt Not Steal. Due to limitations in the production process, various scenes in the script were shortened. Of the film's length, the director commented: \"Of course, the whole story need to be tell with more depth and time (sic), but we reserve the full development of the plot for the feature script. Here we concentrate on feelings and emotion. For that reason I wanted to develop a plot that displayed a wide range of emotions in a short period of time.\" Regarding this, the critic Michael D. Klemm notes: \"A short film can be like a sketch for a painting and this one begins, appropriately, with rough drawings of the two leads. The emphasis here, undoubtedly, is what the young postman would remember from his abrupt adventure. The main idea behind the characters is based on cartoon figures from the Japanese yaoi. In the opening and closing credits the film uses sketches that represent the characters of Toto and Mark, bringing an added dimension to the story. Susan Opperman, a South African artist with an MFA in fine arts, created the images, following her own vision of the story. The film was shot in 16mm Kodak film and the principal photography took place in the summer of 2008 in California. Some of the locations were Mulholland Drive, Burbank, California, as well as some isolated roads outside Los Angeles. The post-production was completed in 2010. Xu Xiaoxi, Roberto F. Canuto's collaborator in the directing (Desire Street and Ni Jing: Thou Shalt Not Steal), was director of photography on Toto Forever. The kissing scene between the characters is a key element of the film. According to the Canuto: \"I wanted to create a montage for the kissing scene. In order to do so, we decided to break standard time and space in order to create a special tempo that surprises the viewer and suspends the reality of the experience. The kissing scene was difficult to film due to the position of movement in such a tight space. This was key to delivering the right feel and emotion.  Kylan and Kjord deliver a moving and touching scene that is also the zenith of the whole story.\" The main theme of Toto Forever is hope. According to the director, he wanted to: \"recreate the moment when the human spirit recovers after a deep tragedy and rediscovers a new faith about life. Emily Dickinson's poem \"Hope\" was an inspiration for this film. While she faced the tragedy, it was with this painful moments when she has to allowed herself to find \"hope\" and move on. As of July 2014, Toto Forever was still being screened at international festivals."

As of July 2014 the film has been screened at over thirty international film festivals. The press reactions were positive and the comments highlight the values of the film. Some of the reactions include: \"Regardless of its brevity, Toto Forever effectively invokes an idyllic mood with an undercurrent of danger. The moments that Toto and Mark get to share are very romantic and sensual...Canuto has a nice eye for the image and effectively exploits the language of close-ups. The lovers' faces fill the screen as they kiss; sometimes the camera lingers only on their lips...Toto Forever is sexy and suspenseful. Despite not being developed into a fully fleshed out movie, Canuto's short contains many pleasures.\" from Michael D. Klemm at Cinemaqueer.com, 2009 (United States). \"...Every detail has significance as they subliminally add substance to an otherwise naive narrative. This collaboration is like a marriage of interpretation between the script and the art of cinema: combining the construct of the director with the skill of the cinematographer... The angle of photography requires of us to re-examine and not view things is a conventional way. Backward glances are shown through rear view mirror techniques and distorted reflections off a champagne bowl question the reason and nature of what might be obvious. Just as the crystal is multifaceted and reflects and refracts, we are encouraged to examine, kaleidoscopically and appreciate how brilliantly colourful this \u2018gem\u2019 is!\" from Dickie King at Movies-TOO-Gay, 2011 (South Africa). \"... this international hit film promises to become one of the new Gay classic movies and we look forward to seeing the new film by director Roberto Canuto\". from Cultura Pride, 2011 (Panama)."

        "content": "Amidst the hills of Sultanpur, a picturesque village in Pakistan, lives Shahida Aziz, named after Pakistani Cricketer, Shahid Afridi, a mute six-year-old girl, with her parents. After an accident in which she is unable to call for help because she is mute, her mother, Razia Aziz (Meher Vij), with able support from her husband Rauf Aziz (Mir Sarwar), decides to take her to the shrine of Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya in Delhi, India via the Samjhauta Express, hoping it will restore her speech. On its way back to Pakistan, the train stops for repairs and Shahida gets off to save a lamb while Razia is asleep. The train leaves before Shahida can re-board. Panicked, she boards a freight train, assuming it to be headed in the same direction, but instead goes reverse-path and winds up in Kurukshetra. During a celebration there, she meets Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi (Salman Khan), who is affectionately called \"Bajrangi\" by the locals. He is a devout Hindu Brahmin and an ardent devotee of Lord Hanuman. Pawan resides at the home of his father's friend, Dayanand Pandey (Sharat Saxena), where he is engaged to Dayanand's daughter, Rasika (Kareena Kapoor). He tries in vain to find out where Shahida lives. He starts calling her \"Munni\" and brings her home. Dayanand lets her stay, thinking she must be Brahmin. However, the family eventually learns that Munni is a Pakistani Muslim. An enraged Dayanand orders Pawan to have her sent to Pakistan through the Pakistani High Commission, but offices are closed due to protests. A local travel agent promises to take Munni to Pakistan without a passport but instead tries to sell her to a brothel, causing Pawan to become enraged. After rescuing her, he vows to take Munni home on his own despite not having a passport and visa. Pawan and Munni are able to enter Pakistan under the border's fences, but shortly later, they are arrested under suspicions of Pawan being an Indian spy. During interrogation, he escapes with Munni and meets Chand Nawab (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), a journalist who works for a Pakistani television channel. Nawab has been following Pawan's situation, thinking he is indeed an Indian spy, but discovers that Pawan is a victim of circumstances who is on a noble mission to reunite the mute Munni with her parents. Moved by his story, Nawab joins him in his journey to find Munni's parents. They encounter an Islamic religious scholar, Asad, who helps them avoid capture by police and directs the group to Azad Kashmir, after Munni recognises an area similar to her hometown in a calendar photo. Meanwhile, Nawab's cameraman, Kamil Yusuf, is arrested by Inspector Aamir Qureshi and Senior Pakistani Police Officer Hamid Khan (Rajesh Sharma) when his efforts to escape fail miserably, and they bait him into tracing Nawab's location. Nawab documents their journey on video, but his boss refuses to air it, thinking it's a useless story. Nawab uploads the video on YouTube, discovering in the process that Kamil is being scapegoated by the police to capture Pawan alive when he notices the team at a shrine. While reviewing the footage, Munni recognises Razia getting off a bus in the background. The trio goes to the bus station and finally identify Sultanpur as Munni's hometown. They board a bus but find that the local officers have put up barricades to identify and catch \"the Indian spy\". Devising a plan to divert police attention, Pawan gets off the bus and runs toward the jungle in full view while Nawab and Munni escape on the other side. Pawan is captured, shot in the arm, and later brutally tortured. Meanwhile, Nawab and Munni reach Sultanpur, where Munni is finally reunited with her parents. The videos uploaded by Nawab go viral throughout India and Pakistan, emotionally moving many. A compassionate Hamid realises that Pawan is innocent after his story is verified, and has him released, defying his boss's order to keep him in jail. Nawab calls for support at Hamid's behest and thousands of Pakistanis and Indians congregate at Narowal Check Post, where Pawan is to return to India. As Pawan crosses the border, Nawab reveals that Munni's real name is Shahida, who, also present in the crowd, runs toward the fence and after some effort, cries out her first word (Pawan's name) to get his attention. Pawan hears her voice, and the two run toward each other as they have a reunion with Pawan tossing Shahida high in the air."

Vijayendra Prasad stated that the idea of the film was inspired by the 1987 Telugu film Pasivadi Pranam, which itself is a remake of the  Malayalam film Poovinu Puthiya Poonthennal (1986). Prasad also took inspiration from a story he heard about a Pakistani couple coming to India for their daughter's heart surgery. Kabir Khan noted that his script for Bajrangi Bhaijaan was influenced by some of his own experiences. He noted the influence of the Hindu epic Ramayana, which he used to watch Ramlila plays of as a child, and particularly the Hindu deity Bajrangi (Hanuman), who left a strong impression on him as a child. He felt that Bajrangi was a character who was loved by people all religious communities in India, including Hindus and Muslims in India, due to how Bajrangi brought joy and fun to many Indian children. Khan began writing Bajrangi Bhaijaan partly in response to the rise of religious sectarianism in India since the 1980s and particularly in response to the Bajrang Dal, a Hindu fundamentalist organisation that appropriated Bajrangi for violent sectarian motives and played a central role in the deadly 2002 Gujarat riots, leading to the name Bajrangi having communal connotations. He began writing Bajrangi Bhaijaan in 2013 as a way of reclaiming Bajrangi for all communities, and as a way of bringing Hindus and Muslims together."

The film received similarly positive reviews from Chinese critics. Several critics in China, where it was released as Little Lolita's Monkey Uncle, noted narrative parallels to the 16th century Chinese epic Journey to the West and its monkey-king hero Sun Wukong (which in turn have similarities to the Hindu epic Ramayana, which was composed between the 7th and 4th centuries BCE, and its monkey-god hero Hanuman), making the film relatable to Chinese audiences. In January 2019, upon release in Japan, it was the week's highest-rated film on the Filmarks audience satisfaction survey. Raja Sen of Rediff.com gave a 3.5 out of 5 star rating explaining that \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan is an overearnest, oversimplified, preposterously sweet and frequently schlocky film, which shouldn't work because of how predictable and soppy it is. Yet, because of a finely picked supporting cast, some sharp lines of dialogue and, most crucially, because of its overall heart, it works, and works well.\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave 3 stars out of 5, commenting \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan is way too long at 2 hours and 35 minutes, and could have done with some serious pruning, especially in its first half. Nevertheless, it's more engaging than such typical Salman Khan blockbusters as Bodyguard and Ready, if only because it has a sliver of a story, and its heart in the right place.\" Anupama Chopra of Hindustan Times said \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan is simplistic, occasionally silly, and tiringly over-stretched. It's also unashamedly manipulative. But it works. Director and co-writer Kabir Khan preserves the larger-than-life Salman image but also allows it to evolve so that the star is not just a slick superman.\" Comparisons were drawn between Bajrangi Bhaijaan and the 2006 Kannada film Kallarali Hoovagi in terms of the core plot and characters."

        "content": "The Kokoda Front Line! is an iconic and Academy Award-winning newsreel shot by Damien Parer which has some of the most iconic pictures of Australian troops.  The Oscar, according to David O. Selznick in 1943, was won for 'effectiveness in depicting simply yet forcefully the scene of war in New Guinea and for its moving presentation of the bravery and fortitude of our Australian comrades in arms'.  In the documentary film, Australian troops from the 39th Battalion are shown along the Kokoda Track walking through a mountainous terrain and across a river. The film through the utilisation of voice actor Peter Bathurst exemplifies the cruel conditions, the bravery of the troops, and the support and care displayed by the Papuans. Footage of The Salvation Army includes a shot of Father Albert Moore lighting a cigarette of an injured soldier. The last series of shots in the film were captured from heightened positions along the track of the Papuan carrying wounded troops climbing through steep terrains in harsh conditions. Parer's sheer fearlessness and devotion to his job played a crucial role in the production of Kokoda Front Line. The combat cameraman being made fully aware of the risk, Parer continued to film the campaign and routinely went to the frontline at Kokoda in order to fulfill his goal to present the true account of events as he saw them.  The nature of the mountainous terrain significantly negatively impacted Parer\u2019s ability to shoot long sequences that didn\u2019t include close-ups of the soldiers standing or trudging through the thick mud along the track. This therefore led to the film being extremely difficult to film, and ultimately led to the death of Damien Parer."

        "content": "In the Kokoda Track campaign, as shown in the film, the main impacts were disease and supply shortages.  Parer through the use of close-ups and long shots captures the wounded and sick soldiers being carried on stretcher bearers and cared for by the Papuans. Prior to this, it was found Australian soldiers suffered more from illness than Japanese soldiers. The Japanese had previous exposure to this in November 1943 and came to the war prepared to combat disease in contrast to Australians. It was evident that in a study conducted by Australians that the Imperial Japanese Army were the 'most inoculated army in the world'.  The advantage of inoculation played a pivotal role in the initial success of the Japanese in the war prevented diseases such as\u00a0malaria and scrub typhus. \u00a0This directly led to the evacuation of 1752 sick Australian soldiers in contrast to 343 sick Japanese soldiers. The decisive moment in the war as depicted in the film was when Japanese casualties were higher than the Australian numbers. This can be directly attributed to supply problems. This is evident through the aerial footage of the thick jungle and vast green plains where supplies are being dropped off. The Australians found in prior operations in the Owen Stanley Range their supply system was inefficient. By trucking all supplies to the front line, 19 tons of supplies required for each 1000 Australian fighting men could be delivered daily. This led to aircraft shortages, and the daily requirement changed to 12 tons of supplies. This was the decisive point in the Kokoda Track campaign as the Japanese, mainly used a poor road system, budgeted six tons of supplies per thousand men per day. The advantage went to the Japanese as they focused on capturing enemy supplies and utilised simple items in food rations in contrast to the Australians, providing them a great advantage as the Australians were too dependent on the food rations."

        "content": "The environmental impact of the Kokoda Track played a pivotal role in the campaign and the number of casualties. Through the lugging of 35\u00a0mm camera and film stock, Parer would spend days perched in a tree in order to accurately capture the narrowness and steep inclines of the track. The aerial footage in the film glanced over the thick jungle over a mountainous terrain, characterised with deep slopes of green plains. The environment is not a healthy environment as soldiers travelled along the track, their health began to decline. Studies at the time concluded that three months in New Guinea directly led to an identifiable decrease in the effectiveness of a unit regardless of being in a battle or not. This can be attributed to the cruel conditions of the environment as the length of the track is  and the climate is characterised by year-round humid days with intense cold nights, torrential rainfall and an increase risk of tropical diseases such as malaria, this makes the track difficult as it is physically demanding. As evident in Parer's footage of the flying aircraft and the Japanese troops along the road the effect of the environment directly impacted the supply line as neither side could maintain a supply line over its distance. The environment also provided problems for soldiers fighting in the jungles as the mountainous terrain, steep slopes and thick jungle interrupted communication. The visibility in the jungle as seen in the film is poor and gradually gets worse when there is fog and rain. This environment directly benefited the Japanese as shown in the film they used tactics of war as gun groups that usually had one group firing towards the enemy and another sweeping the enemy yet in the condition of the Kokoda Track unless the attacker had been fired on by the hidden enemy it was very hard to be aware of enemy presence. The narrator in the film referred to the Japanese as 'masters of camouflage'; the camouflage and deception displayed by the Japanese played a pivotal role in the early advancements of the Japanese as the treacherous terrain and rainfall significantly impacted the visibility."

        "content": "Kokoda Front Line! through Parer's cinematography of wounded soldiers and mountainous setting was able to emotionally capture the Australian audience. Parer's bravery through his determination to record the Australian troops heading towards battle played a pivotal role in portraying the emotional climax and the iconic moving images of Australians during the Second World War. As seen in the documentary there is a scene were a wounded soldier appears like a hero figure \u2013 with a damaged shirt and with his arms spread apart. Salvation Army officer Albert Moore offers him a cigarette. Cigarettes were used in the army as an antidepressant due to the traumatic events that soldiers experience during the war. The Salvation Army's refreshment centre was established on 6 September 1942 and chaplain Major Albert Moore, the centre was the main provider of beverages by producing an average of  of coffee or hot tea. The film had soldiers captured in a cross-like figure which can be attributed to Parer\u2019s Catholic background which could have directly led to this imagery. The film did this in order to reassure their audience that God was protecting them as at the time Australia had a high Catholic background. In the news reel the troops are portrayed to be bold and courageous soldiers battling a ghost of an enemy. In the newsreel there is also a distinct absence of the Japanese soldiers in the images and this is evident throughout the newsreel. This can be attributed to the tactical warfare established by the Japanese throughout the war. The narrator makes constant reference to the invisibility of the Japanese troops and this is due to the intelligence and deception levels. As the film was produced from an Australian perspective there is limited footage of Japanese soldiers, as in the film the only evidence of Japanese is masked behind the tropical terrain. Parer despite not utilising much footage of the Japanese troops managed to evoke an emotional drama that lies heavily on the depiction of the cruel conditions that the Australian troops had to overcome and the cunning narration. A key part of the film was the role of Papua and New Guinea territories in its assistance to the Australian troops in succeeding in the war. In the newsreel the Papuan carriers are shown as kind and quiet people and contribute significantly to the footage in the film. In the narration Bathurst through colloquial language that at the time was acceptable states that, the Papuan carriers in their aid to the Australian troops are 'black skinned boys that are white'.  This type of language will be recognised now as racist and discriminatory at the time was used to display the gratitude and respect they played in helping wounded Australian soldiers and educating the troops about the mountainous terrain and diseases."

        "content": "Parer's footage of the Kokoda Track campaign accompanied with the commentary built the emotional drama to Australians the true realities of the war in the Pacific; in later trying to capture the cruel conditions of the war Parer died filming footage of the Australian troops at war on the island of Peleliu.  Kokoda Front Line! was able to win the Oscar for the Best Documentary category in 1943 largely to Parer's film style as his ability to capture the everyday lives of troops anticipated the cinema-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style of the documentary. Jenifer Coombes, a film curator at the National Film and Sound Archive, said 'He liked the idea of introducing a dramatic element into the documentary by putting Damien into the role of narrator'. Years after the film's release despite the Oscar been in a vault, the role of the Kokoda Front Line! on the Australian psyche remains. The film has been a constant reminder to Australians particularly on Anzac Day of the courage it took the soldiers to overcome the mountainous terrain and is often used as a reference point to remember the soldiers that have lost their lives. The high casualty rates of approximately 625 Australians and over 1600 wounded severely impacted many Australian troop family members. The war also had everlasting psychological effects were soldiers suffered from PTSD due to prolonged exposure to enemy fire. The rhetorical style of the narration played a pivotal role in enhancing the Australian audience sense that Australia was in danger and through the capturing of the tropical landscape were able to come to the realisation that the soldiers at any moment could have been killed. The narration also provides a strong indicator that propaganda films can still be very emotionally scaring.  The final image is emotionally moving and memorable. The film by capturing the soldiers with their ankles deep in mud portrays the 39th Battalion representing every Australian soldier playing the role for their country. The determination and talent portrayed by Parer through his shots composed with light on the soldiers face. There was a dispute between Ken Hall and Parer on who should narrate the film they held a briefing and decided Parer should speak on the film. The Kokoda Front Line! also played a pivotal role in fostering positive relationships with today's Papua New Guinea, as Australia already had a relationship with the inhabitants. However, the kind acts of the Papuans and knowledge spread by them reassured Australians that in the event of jeopardy they would be there to help. The film through the use of Parer's footage enhanced editing by Cinesound Review and the production used to produce the film."

It is in his execution that he falters. For a thriller clocking in at under two hours, Gethu moves at a pace that is as sleepy as the hill station where the action happens. The director's choice of slow motion shots as a device to make the action stylish and prolong the tension in the plot works against the film.\" Sudhir Srinivasan of The Hindu stated, \"The whole movie bears the flavour of a short-story adaptation, and at a little over two hours, there isn\u2019t too much duration in which to flood the story with masala elements and thoroughly destroy it, although, to its discredit, Gethu certainly does try.\" The entertainment tax exemption request for the film was denied on the basis that the filmmakers misspelled the English title as \"Gethu\" instead of \"Kethu\", the latter being the correct transliteration of a Tamil word. Government officials argued that since films released using Tamil words are entitled to an entertainment tax, and that \"Gethu\" is not a Tamil word, the film would not be entitled to an exemption.

While they are waiting in the party office for the leader to come in, they witness an accidental murder of a rebel in the party, by their own revered leader due to caste-related comments by the rebel on him. When the leader asks Sengalvarayan to take the blame by saying that he killed the man due to rage about the rebel's comments, Pazhani volunteers to take the blame and is willing to go to jail, citing the leniency of juvenile laws in exchange for an MLA seat for his father in the upcoming by-elections.

After the completion of his training, Mithran is awarded medals for specializing in dealing with organized crime during training and also for being the best probationer of the batch, and is posted as the ASP of the Organized Crime Unit. Mithran discovers that Siddharth is Sengalvarayan's son Pazhani. After his release from prison, Pazhani had his name changed and left India to complete his education abroad. After his graduation, he returned to India and is now a well-established scientist. Siddarth uses the medical field for the wrong reasons and for his own profit. Sengalvarayan is now the incumbent health and welfare minister in the minority government headed by the party leader. At that time, Angelina, a Swiss pharmaceutical company owner and activist, tries to make generic medicines for life-threatening diseases available in India at low cost affordable by poor people. Siddharth's assassin kills Angelina before she can sign the agreement document with the government and shoots Mithran at the same time. While he is recovering from the gunshot wound in the hospital, an electronic bug (GPS + audio transmitter) is implanted during surgery. Through the bug, Siddharth listens to all of Mithran's plans and continuously monitors his whereabouts and whatever he talks via an audio transmission. Then comes evidence against Siddharth in the form of Manimekalai. Dr.Manimekalai was a scientist at Siddharth's research lab, where a seaweed that can cure diabetes is found abundantly in the oceans. Siddharth tries to sell the technology and rights to extract medicine from the seaweed to multinational pharmaceutical companies but is opposed by Manimekalai. So Siddharth arranges goons, and the goons killed her. But before being killed, she records a video and stores it in an SD card so that someone will find it. But before Mithran can find the card, Siddharth finds out and assigns Vicky, Perumal Swamy's brother, to recover the card, but Mithran tells Jana to get the card. He successfully gets the card after a fight with Vicky, but through the bug, Siddharth knows this and kills Jana. Mithran comes back to his special house where he finds a pin that has been changed in a picture which turns out to be the picture of Ananya, who was Miss World 2011 and a close acquaintance of Siddharth whose girlfriend Shilpa was also part of that event. Mithran doubts whether Siddharth himself would have come to his house. Mahima checks the fingerprints on the pin keeping the gun case Mithran received from Siddharth in his posting ceremony, and the fingerprints match. A flashback reveals that Siddharth killed Shilpa's father so that she would not participate in the competition, and as she will not have a ticket to go to her father's funeral, he offers to take her in his chartered flight and wins her over. Mithran frantically searches for the bug, which he eventually finds and removes. Mithran captures Vicky and records all the information from him. He drugs Vicky and manipulates Siddharth into killing him. At the same time, Siddharth's father reads the changed medical report, which contains very good medical contracts for public welfare and multiple accusations against the CM. When Siddharth learns about this, he asks Sengalvarayan to pretend to have chest pains and move outside to the hospital. The ruling party forces Sengalvarayan either to resign within 24 hours or he will be dismissed. Mithran appeals to the CM that he has evidence and wants to arrest Siddharth, and he is granted permission to do so. Hence Siddarth kills his father using his goons in an accident and forces the CM to stop actions against him, or he will lie that the CM killed his father for personal vengeance. But the next day, at his father's state funeral, Mithran arrests him on the CM's orders. When Siddharth is arrested, Mithran tells him that the medicine was patented in Manimekalai's name (despite Siddarth being the inventor) and will be made as generic medicine instead of a patent-protected one. It is also revealed that Sengalvarayan is still alive, saved by Mithran and his gang and the public funeral held was for Jana. Mithran makes a deal that he would save Siddharth's life for information and evidence on all of his criminal associates and activities and gives him a bulletproof vest to fake his death during his transport to the court. They also plan to take down the setup planned by various VIPs to kill Siddharth when one of them gets close to Siddharth, Mithran notices and pushes Siddharth back. To Mithran's surprise, Siddharth does not wear the vest and is fatally shot by Shilpa. Before dying, he tells Mithran that he hid all the evidence in an SD card in the bulletproof vest, adding that he had not done it for the nation but because Mithran had asked for it. The film then happily ends with the arrest of all of Siddharth's accomplices and Mithran marrying Mahima. The last narration was by Mithran on how he became a successful police officer in his life, after solving the case (about a boy going to prison for a crime he did not commit), he read for the first time on the newspaper."

As before approaching Ravi for an original script, he turned down directing the Ramana remake with Akshay Kumar and denied the news working in the Ek Tha Tiger remake with Vijay as he earlier stated that Vijay was the reason for him to do the movie and believed him that he could pull off an original script as he had Vijay in mind for the script, but Vijay wanted Ravi to do the role to give Ravi the breakthrough.

The flavour may seem out of place initially because you aren\u2019t used to it. But if you try it with an open mind, you\u2019d probably savour it.\" Idlebrain.com gave it 3.75/5 and wrote, \"The underlying emotion of father-son gets fused in the complex screenplay and the mind games between hero and villain. It\u2019s a great effort by Sukumar in terms of screenplay and logic. On a whole, Nannaku Prematho is a commendable and extraordinary concept thriller made on grand scale.\" Business Standard stated that NTR, particularly, needs to be lauded for not playing to the gallery and choosing to work with a director who isn't afraid to go against the tide. This is precisely why you want to appreciate Sukumar, who, by all means, could have safely made a regular commercial potboiler. But he didn't, and that's what differentiates him from other filmmakers as he made this film an action thriller with memorable twists. \"Nannaku Prematho\", on the whole, isn't a bad film as it was made even more sensibly."

They ask Shiva's friend DSP Chandrashekar's help, but he is helpless as there is no proper evidence against them given that they have an influential background. Then Janatha Garage becomes a self-appointed group of citizens led by Sathyam who undertake law enforcement by killing the goons and making it look like an accident. Chandrasekhar becomes aware of this and warns them against taking law into their hands as he is worried about the consequences. Janatha Garage becomes popular among the local people as they believe that they'll get justice from them. Shiva marries a Mumbai-based man Suresh's sister, and they have a son Anand. One day Mukesh, a powerful entrepreneur with lot of criminal dealings and who was also the brother of a goon who was killed by Sathyam, visits and warns him. A few days later, Shiva and his wife get ambushed by Mukesh's men, and both are killed. Sathyam, fearing for Anand's safety, asks Suresh to take him away from his family and Janatha Garage. As the years pass, Anand grows up as an environmental science graduate and activist in Mumbai, who is against any activity which can harm the environment. Suresh's daughter Bujji and Anand are in love with each other, and her parents are happy with that. Anand also befriends a girl Anu, whom he scolds for using firecrackers during Diwali. Anand gets into a fight with a powerful local MLA. Fearing for his safety, Suresh sends him away to Hyderabad under the pretext of a university exchange program. Meanwhile Raghava, Sathyam's son, marries Mukesh's daughter without his family's approval. Sathyam meets with an accident planned by Mukesh, but recovers. Janatha Garage is now inactive solving the problems of the common men as Sathyam was asked not to take any stress. Anand fights off Raghava's thugs regarding an illegal mining field. Sathyam meets with Anand, and both develop a mutual respect for each other, without knowing they are uncle and nephew. Sathyam asks Anand to take over Janatha Garage. Anand quickly becomes a family member of the house. They save a strict government officer Vikas from some of Mukesh's men. Janatha Garage becomes popular among the public once again. Chandrashekar, now the Commissioner of Police, finds out about Anand and brings Suresh and his family. Sathyam and others are shocked to know that Anand is his late brother's son. Suresh, who is bothered about Bujji's safety, asks Anand to choose either his daughter or Janatha Garage. Anand, with a heavy heart, chooses to stay with his father's family, and he and Bujji say goodbye tearfully. She marries a boy of her parents' choice. Meanwhile, Raghava and his wife leave Sathyam's house because of their uncultured lifestyle, creating a ruckus with Anand and the family. In order to overthrow the government, Mukesh and Raghava plan and execute a bomb blast in Hyderabad. Bose, one of Sathyam's closest allies, loses his loved one in the blast. The next day, Bose's body is found in the railway track, with reports citing he committed suicide. The police chief asks Chandrasekhar to close the case. Chandrasekhar comes to Janatha Garage for help. Anand finds out that Bose was killed by Raghava as Bose had found that it was Raghava who planned the blasts. Sathyam decides that even though Raghava is his son, he doesn't deserve to live. Anand and others from Janatha Garage beat up Mukesh's men in their hideout. Anand kills Mukesh, and Raghava pleads for mercy. Sathyam arrives and kills Raghava without remorse.

One day, Kombaiah is stabbed in his neck by someone, and the news comes as a shock to the entire town. Now, Kidaari sets stage to find the culprit behind the assault and lists out all the suspects.

Finally, Kidaari finds out that Kombaiah\u2019s brother in-law and close aide, Pulikutthi Pandian (O. A. K. Sundar), was responsible for the assault. Pulikutthi admits that Kombaiah was stabbed accidentally when Pulikutthi tried to safeguard him from Kombaiah. A flashback is shown detailing the rivalry between Kombaiah and his own son Nambi (Vasumithra). Pulikutthi\u2019s only daughter was married to Kombaiah\u2019s son Nambi. Trouble erupts between Nambi and his father Kombaiah, which leads to Kombaiah killing his own son. This worries Pulikutthi as his daughter has become a widow because of Kombaiah.

The pilot Varun Chakrapani ejects from the hit aircraft and lands in enemy territory. The Pakistani Army promptly surrounds him. They imprison him in the Rawalpindi as a Prisoner of War (PoW) and subject him to torture. While being held captive, he reminisces about his romance with Leela. Leela comes to Srinagar to work as a doctor. Meanwhile, Varun has an accident while on a joy ride. He is brought in a critical condition to the hospital. With the duty doctor not available, Leela takes charge, treats Varun, and nurses him back to health. But, with little regard to her feelings, he leaves the hospital without her knowledge.  Dr. Illyas Hussain, an army doctor, helps him with this. When Leela learns about it, she and Nidhi, her colleague confront Illyas about it. Ilyas then arranges for Leela and Nidhi to come to an Airforce meeting the following week and there they meet Varun. Varun impresses her with his excellent dance moves at the Ball.  He tells her she should meet him at the Flying Club the next Saturday at 5 pm if she likes him back. Leela accepts and Varun takes her for a joy ride in his private aircraft to apologize for running away from the hospital. Varun gets to know that Leela is his course pilot Ravi Abraham's sister, who died in a flight that Varun was supposed to fly in. Both develop feelings for each other. Later, Leela doesn't meet Varun for two months and questions Illyas about his whereabouts. He reveals that Varun has orders to be in a camp at Leh Military base for 3 months. Leela and Nidhi go to meet him. When Varun asks whether Leela came to meet him, she says yes. But also that she wanted to see the place where her brother Ravi died. He takes her to the spot. Slowly she realizes that Varun has a dark side to his personality, which is very different from what she has seen. Back to the present, Varun and two other Indian prisoners plan to escape from the Rawalpindi prison. Back to the past, Leela leaves and he tells her that she'll get couriers from him. He's true to his word. One day, the officers are discussing their attack and she airs her opinion on the subject.  Varun angrily tells her that God made men and women for different purposes and she can't talk about this. But, she retaliates by saying that both genders are equal and women are not made just to manage the house and give birth to children. Varun tells Leela to shut up, but she refuses. So, he orders her to do what he tells her. She gets angry and moves out. He goes to her home and tries to make up with her by expressing his love for her. He says he's not like her. Hers is a nobler job than him as he kills and she saves lives. So, Varun takes Leela to a local Registrar office and tells her that they should marry. As she is not ready for marriage, he asks her to think about it and come the next day at 4.00 pm. In a sad turn of events, he leaves for Delhi forgetting about what happened at the Registrar office. This upsets Leela very much. She feels that sometimes he treats her like a Queen whereas at other times like a doormat. Leela reveals that she's pregnant. Varun gets hesitant about it and Leela says that she'll take care of her baby by herself. The following day, Leela's grandfather dies. VC goes to her house and finds that Leela's father hates him. That night he goes and tries to convince them, but he doesn't get even a single word from them. Before Varun departs for the Kargil war, Leela tells him that she's resigning and leaving Srinagar. He pleads for one more chance and goes away to war. While fighting, he gets captured by the enemy and taken a prisoner. Somehow, Varun and the two other prisoners escape and reach India. Varun starts searching for Leela. He finds her after 3 years. He tells her that he's a different person now. He says that he regrets his meeting her and loving her only to end up hurting her. VC is surprised to learn that Leela has a daughter. When he sees her daughter, Leela asks him whether she (the small girl) looks like her father or mother. VC's happiness knows no bounds. He tells his daughter that he crossed 7 seas and 7 mountains to meet her. VC asks Leela why she didn't try to contact him, to which she says that she was afraid he wouldn't like her or their daughter. They hug each other and Leela says that Rohini (VC's daughter) is his responsibility from thereon."

        "content": "After shelving a multi-cast project featuring Karthi and Dulquer Salmaan in the lead roles during December 2015, it was reported in the media that Mani Ratnam would instead work on a new film retaining Karthi as the lead actor and A. R. Rahman as the music composer and Ravi Varman as cinematographer. In February 2016, Karthi confirmed that he had signed on to play the lead role and would collaborate with the director twelve years after having worked with him as an assistant during the making of Aayutha Ezhuthu (2004). Mani Ratnam requested Karthi to lose weight through the CrossFit program and learn the basics of flying to portray the lead character of a pilot. He prepared for the role by understanding more about fighter pilots through a wing commander friend including Varthaman and analysed their typical fitness routine their body language. Karthi also was asked to sport a clean-shaven look like a part of his role and did so for the first time in his acting career. The start of the film was delayed as the team wanted to wait for a better climate, before beginning the shoot in Kashmir, while the team also chose to wait for Karthi to finish his commitments for the production of Kaashmora (2016). Sai Pallavi successfully auditioned for the leading female role of a doctor in the project and was signed on to make her debut as a lead actress in the Tamil film industry through the project. However, in April 2016, Mani Ratnam felt that the character had to be older and opted to leave Sai Pallavi out of the project, later replacing her with Aditi Rao Hydari. Hydari participated in Tamil lessons prior to the film's shoot, in order to improve her understanding of the script. She also worked in a hospital for a few days in order to get a better understanding of her role as a doctor. Mani Ratnam and his team began location hunting in April 2016 to seek out replacements to resemble Kashmir and scouted areas including Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Kodaikanal, Ooty and Coonoor. Meanwhile, Mani Ratnam also worked closely with music composer A. R. Rahman and lyricist Vairamuthu in finalizing seven songs for the film during the pre-production period. The rights to Faith Johnson's book Four Miles to Freedom was also bought by the team, as they looked to draw inspiration from the real-life incidents of Dilip Parulkar's escape from a Pakistani jail in 1971. Actors RJ Balaji and Delhi Ganesh joined the cast of the film in July 2016, while actress Shraddha Srinath revealed that she would feature in a small role as a brigadier's daughter. Kannada actor Harish Raj and Hindi actor Vipin Sharma also joined the first schedule of the film, making their debuts in the Tamil film industry. Likewise, actresses Lalitha and Rukmini Vijayakumar were signed up for roles during the film's initial schedule. The film's first look poster was revealed in early July 2016, with the title of Kaatru Veliyidai, inspired by a poem by Subramania Bharati, officially announced."

The location was chosen to show Kashmir on screen, as the latter's climate had made conducting shooting there difficult. Art director Amaran and production designer Sharmishta Roy worked together on designing the set during the first schedule, choosing to enhance existing backgrounds rather than to create lavish sets. The team regularly shot scenes from sunrise onwards, in order to ensure that the film progressed quickly. A second schedule for the film took place in Hyderabad during October 2016, lasting a period of ten days. The team then moved to Leh and the surrounding areas of Ladakh for a third schedule lasting fifteen days, with action sequences choreographed by Sham Kaushal being filmed. In late November 2016, the team moved to shoot scenes in, Siberia and the surrounding snow-capped mountainous regions after they were denied permission to shoot action sequences involving aircraft in North India. During the ten-day schedule, the team also shot a romantic song in the snowy backdrop choreographed by Brindha. The shoot was concluded in mid-January 2017, with the team announcing that the post-production phase would take a couple of months."

        "content": "Upon release, Kaatru Veliyidai received mixed reviews; though critics predominantly praised the performance of Hydari along with Rahman's music and Ravi Varman's cinematography, they criticised Mani Ratnam's screenplay. Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion gave the film a high score of 3.5 out of 5 stars, writing \"as a movie, Kaatru Veliyidai leaves you wanting, but as cinema, very little can come close to it\". Rangan added \"like some of Mani Ratnam\u2019s recent films, Kaatru Veliyidai feels abstracted\" and that the \"director is in his mature phase\" with \"a little less obvious, little more complicated version of storytelling\". Anupama Subramaniam of the Deccan Chronicle wrote \"Mani Ratnam, known for his romantic tales with a different note, surprises you with a fresh angle again\", noting that it was \"a poetic romance that is worth experiencing\", while drawing particular praise for the performances of Karthi and Aditi Rao Hydari. A critic from DNA India noted that the film \"does not disappoint\" and that \"to say that Mani portrays the lovers\u2019 intense passion with a painter's bold and indelible strokes would be no exaggeration\", while similarly Rediff.com's Divya Nair called the film a \"beautiful romance\". Malini Mannath of The New Indian Express wrote that \"Kaatru Veliyidai is visual treat where roses overpower guns\" and that despite a few glitches, it is a \"love poem on celluloid\". Kaveree Bamzai wrote for dailyo that \"Few directors understand women as well as Mani Ratnam. He understands they are complicated, vulnerable, strong, powerful, independent and submissive at the same time. But it is in his writing of Varun that Mani Ratnam shows real spunk. Kaatru Veliyidai may not be Mani Ratnam's best, but it beats Bollywood.\" Tanul Thakur of thewire.in wrote in his analysis that \"Kaatru Veliyidai's portrayal of toxic masculinity through the lens of a successful love story is much more intelligent and unsettling than it lets on.\" Sify's reviewer also praised the film stating \"it is an experience you must enjoy\", stating \"if you like beautiful, intimate, playful, passionate love story in typical Mani Ratnam style then Kaatru Veliyidai is bang on\". Vishal Menon of The Hindu wrote \"there are reasons why Kaatru Veliyidai is certainly no classic\", \"but when you leave the theatre with a lump in your throat, you remember how your love for this director doesn\u2019t arise merely because he makes you smile\u00a0\u2014 he does so much more than that\". Giving the film their highest score of 2017, Top10Cinema.com wrote \"it\u2019s a custom made film for Maniratnam buffs, who are very well etched up with his trademark pattern of storytelling\" and that \"he film has brilliant flash point of visual and musical poetry with some nuance performances too\". In their review, Behindwoods.com wrote the film \"is a classical poetic love story\" and that \"it is not a film to watch but something to experience, but an experience that not everyone would accept\". In contrast, Karthik Kumar of The Hindustan Times called the film \"an underwhelming love saga\", adding \"visually, Kaatru Veliyidai is beautiful, beyond anyone\u2019s imagination\" but the film \"does not move you emotionally\". Suganth of the Times of India noted \"the leads have charm, and try their best to make us care, but we are never as emotionally invested in the fate of VC and Leela as we should be\", though wrote \"the film is saved to an extent by the technical proficiency on display\u00a0\u2014 right from Ravi Varman\u2019s lush visuals to Rahman\u2019s peppy score and Sharmishta Roy\u2019s realistic sets, the film is a treat technically\". The Bangalore Mirror's critic wrote \"Kaatru Veliyidai eventually is one of Mani Ratnam\u2019s weaker films and that\u2019s disappointing, thankfully it is not a disaster like Kadal\". Likewise, a critic from The Indian Express wrote \"Kaatru Veliyidai flunks the test\" and \"what we are left with is a few moments in which Hydari impresses, the spectacular scenery, shot by Ravi Varman, and a couple of rousing song-and-dance numbers, powered by A R Rahman\u2019s score\"."

Until they get their jobs, they go around places putting off fires and saving lives by themselves. Their actions are praised by everyone, including the zonal fire officer Narayanamoorthy, who promises them that they will get their jobs if they write and pass the exam that is needed for them to join the fire service. The night before the exam, an injured Dhana meets his friends. He tells them that while he was coming back home after seeing his sister, he was stopped by a man named Sadha and his friend Soori. Sadha repeatedly assaults Dhana and tells Soori that he is a don and is unstoppable. When Sadha slaps Dhana, Dhana pushes him away and escapes. The friends later go to the place where the incident happened in order to teach Sadha a lesson. To their shock, they see Sadha dead. It is revealed that when Dhana pushed Sadha, Sadha fell down, hit a rock, and succumbed to his injury. It is also revealed that he was the right hand of \"Puliyanthoppu\" Ravi, the city's most feared don. The friends seek help from MLA Kabali, the area counsellor and a well-wisher of Guru. Kabali tells them that Ravi will definitely come to them to avenge Sadha's death and that he cannot help them as Ravi is too powerful for him. Guru suggests that the friends finish off Ravi before he finds them, so the friends decide to kidnap him. The friends later visit Sadha's burial place, where all the dons from Chennai have assembled. Guru tells his friends that once Ravi goes away, they will kidnap him. At the site, Ravi asks Soori, who was drinking when the incident happened, only for him to not remember anything as he was drunk. Ravi then kills Soori in a fit of rage, and Guru is relieved since the only evidence against the friends is the dead Soori. However, Guru then gets a call from two of his friends, who were hiding in another place. They tell him that they have kidnapped Ravi. Guru is very upset and explains to his friends what happened, telling them that they are back in trouble. As they discuss what to do next, Ravi manages to escape, and asks the friends for help. Apparently, Ravi actually does not know who kidnapped him as he met with an accident and became unconscious, so the friends release him. However, Ravi is, in fact, keen on finding the man who kidnapped him and killed Sadha. He then catches Kabali, who tells him everything. The friends are tracked down by Ravi. Guru later engages in a fight with Ravi and his henchmen, where he manages to defeat them but decides to spare Ravi. Guru tells Ravi that Sadha's death was an accident, but Ravi still has vengeance and threatens to kill Guru's loved ones. Some days later, Guru's father, Manikkam, is killed. Guru suspects that it was Ravi and decides to take revenge. However, he finds him and his henchmen dead. Commissioner Ramkumar reveals to Guru that Ravi was killed before Manikkam. Suddenly, Guru gets a call saying that his friends and girlfriend Vasumathi (Narayanamoorthy's daughter) have been kidnapped, and he must come to a location if he wants to see them alive. There, it is revealed that the person behind the murders is Annam, Sadha's transgender wife who has been trying to avenge his death. She approaches Ravi, but he refuses to help her, saying that Sadha's death was an accident and he will not kill Guru or his friends. Annam is angered by this and kills Ravi, his henchmen, and then Manikkam. Annam tells Guru that Sadha had loved her despite her being a transgender and, thinking that Guru shattered her life, decides to kill Vasumathi. However, Dhana escapes and manages to push Annam into a pyre, which was burning. Guru saves Vasumathi, his friends, and also Annam, stating that he will never let someone get killed by fire. He also apologizes to Annam, saying that Sadha's death was an accident. Annam gets moved by his gesture and forgives him. Guru then leaves the place with his friends and girlfriend. Later, the five friends write the exam, succeed in passing it, join the fire service, and rush to a spot to save some people."

Aryan Singha, a chief strategist, and his team volunteer to find AK. AK lives happily with his wife Yazhini, who owns and manages an Indian restaurant. Their life is interrupted by a mission to trace a hacker, Natasha from Bulgaria, who is responsible for cracking the security codes of the plutonium weapons. There have already been three man-made seismic activities caused by the explosion of plutonium bombs. She is wanted by the Interpol, CIA, and terrorist groups around the world for her hacking skills. AK's mission is to secure Natasha, thereby preventing the two future seismic quakes targeted in India. AK goes back to Serbia in search of Natasha, where he is guided by APS (Arumai Prakasm), a local translator. He interrogates the hospital doctors in the city and finds that Natasha has undergone plastic facial alteration surgery. Meanwhile, an Albanian gang has hijacked Natasha's boyfriend and tortured him to death. With the help of the pacemaker found in her boyfriend's body, AK traces Natasha and moves her to a safe house. Natasha is unaware that the code she decrypted was that of a nuclear weapon. She feels guilty and proposes to defuse the remaining weapons from a neutrino site. On their way to the site, Natasha is killed by a group of terrorists. Aryan and his team ambush AK and open fire at him. AK survives the ambush and kills two of his ex-teammates. Aryan hires an assassin to kill Yazhini. AK neutralizes the assassins and saves his wife. Later, AK learns that Aryan and his teammates belong to the shadow government which controls the economy of the world by war manipulation. Aryan, as a counter-terrorist officer and shadow government agent, forces AK and his pregnant wife into hiding by blaming AK as the most wanted terrorist. AK releases a video challenging Aryan and his group to save Aryan from being assassinated. AK tries to stop the nuclear weapon from blasting by turning off all the satellites by powerhub. To stop AK from continuing his job, Aryan kidnaps AK's wife and keeps her in a secret place. He asks AK whether he will save his wife or stop the bomb. AK seeks proof for her kidnapping as Yazhini provides him with her location using Morse code. Aryan shows AK that he has Yazhini on a video call, and Yazhini gives her location by blinking in a pattern consistent with Morse code. AK beats up Aryan and prevents the plutonium weapon from exploding. The movie ends with AK, Yazhini, and their child going for a long drive, when suddenly, a mission comes for AK."

Performed by Malaysian rapper Yogi B, the song has lyrics about survival. With a tagline \"Believe in yourself\", this new track is believed to be along similar lines of never giving up and surviving. The second song \"Thalai Viduthalai\" is in the death metal rock genre. It is based on a punchline \u2013 'Never, ever GIVE UP!' that became a rage after fans saw Ajith saying in a high-pitched tone in the teaser earlier. Thalai Viduthalai is written by director Siva and is a highly motivating song to wake up in the morning and start your day with a new passion. The philosophy of the song is, irrespective of the number of times you have been knocked down, as long as you are willing to stand up again and fight back, you are not a failure. The heavy metal track and adrenaline pumping lyrics match the larger than life onscreen and off-screen image of Ajith. Besides composing tunes, Anirudh Ravichander has also lent his voice to the song along with Harish Swaminathan. Anirudh quoted that, this song is a tribute and dedication to 'Thala' Ajith Kumar for his 25 years of grit, determination and hardwork in his cinema career\" The third song \"Kaadhalada\" is a classic number. In one of the recent interviews with a leading daily, Kabilan Vairamuthu, who has penned the lyrics for Kadhalaada song revealed how he got this opportunity. He said, I was initially called in to work on the script; I ve co-written the screenplay. That was my first job in Vivegam, and during a discussion, this opportunity to write the lyrics for a song came up. The lyricist did not reveal much about the song before its release but opened up about the film. He further added, Vivegam has come out in a very stylish manner. I m sure it will be enjoyed by people of all ages.\" Kabilan is working with Ajith Kumar for the first time.

Behindwoods rated the film 2.25 out of 5, stating, \"Vivegam \u2013 High on production value and action. Heavily dependent on Ajith's persona, engagement factor takes a beating\". Mirchi9 gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, saying \" Overall, Vivekam is for the fans and fans alone for whom just watching the star on screen is enough. There is ample style and punch dialogues with a healthy dose of action. For everyone else, it is an utterly boring film\". Nowrunning rated the film 1.5/5 and said \"Director Siva had collected a bunch of Spy movies from Hollywood and made a mashup of them. He picked up all the action blocks and combined it with loud background score which will only irk the audience. Even the action is also missing in the second half and there is no logic at all. The climax is stretched further which disappoints the audience\". Srinivasa Ramanujan of The Hindu wrote, \"Vivegam is a misfire on many levels. It's an attempt to make an \u201cinternational\u201d thriller, with the assumption that a star with a huge fan base would be able to pull it off. Ajith's effort is sincere, but Vivegam just doesn't come together.\""

        "content": "Kattula Katamarayudu is a brave person living in a village called Oddaanchatram. He lives with his four brothers. The elder brother loves the younger ones to the core and sacrifices his happiness for their good. They are often caught in fights and are proud of it. Advocate Bail Lingam bails them out whenever legal issues arise because of their brawls. Katamarayudu hates the idea of marriage as he feels that his wife might create disharmony among brothers. Though the four younger brothers say that they do not want to either fall in love or get married, when Kattula Katamarayudu is not around, they all have their secret lovers. Now, in order to get the green light for their love stories, they learn through his brother's childhood friend Collector that Kattula Katamarayudu, in school, was in love with a girl named Avantika, and his brothers hatch a plan to find her and reintroduce her to Kattula Katamarayudu so that he can fall for her all over again. However, she is married now and has kids, so the brothers conspire to do the most logical thing, which is to find another woman named Avantika because Kattula Katamarayudu was not in love with that girl so much as her name, and when he meets another (completely random) girl with that name, he is sure to lose his heart to her just because she bears that name. Though initially reluctant, later Kattula Katamarayudu himself falls in love with her. He clashes with a businessman called Radia to take care of the market in the village. Radia tries to kill Kattula Katamarayudu's brothers, while Kattula Katamarayudu kidnaps Radia's son Juttu Ranga. After clashing, Kattula Katamarayudu orders Radia to leave the village. While travelling in the train to Avantika's village, Avantika narrates her family background to Kattula Katamarayudu. Avanthika's father Bhupathi is a respected man in the village who hates violence, while his son is the exact opposite who kills people, but when he is killed, Bhupathi refuses to bury his body and decides to make his village with peace and harmony. A few goons enter into the train, but Kattula Katamarayudu bashes all the rowdies. Avantika is shocked to see Kattula Katamarayudu, who she thought was a nonviolent person. Kattula Katamarayudu and his brothers arrive at Avantika's village with clean shaven looks. He says that he has changed and would never harbor violence, and he and his brothers are welcomed and respected by her family. Bhupathi is touched and impressed by their love, affection, and hospitality. Kattula Katamarayudu learns that an illegal goon named Yelasari Bhanu wants to kill Bhupathi and his family. The reason is revealed through a flashback that Yelasari Bhanu's father is responsible for the blast of a matchstick factory. Bhupathi complains against Yelasari Bhanu's father and is arrested, and the father commits suicide by getting hit by a lorry. Yelasari Bhanu swears revenge against Bhupathi. Kattula Katamarayudu finishes all the goons and solves all their problems without the knowledge of Bhupathi and the family. When Bhupathi's granddaughter finds a sickle under Kattula Katamarayudu's jeep, Bhupathi orders Kattula Katamarayudu to go out of town. Yelasari Bhanu, who escapes from the death sentence, arrives to kill Bhupathi, but Kattula Katamarayudu keeps him and his family in a safe place. Yelasari Bhanu informs Kattula Katamarayudu that he had kidnapped one of his brothers, Sivarayudu. Kattula Katamarayudu arrives at the nick of time and saves his brother but instead gets attacked by Yelasari Bhanu. Bhupathi and his family, who arrive at the place, come to know about the risk taken by Kattula Katamarayudu to save him from the mess. Attacked Kattula Katamarayudu rises steadily and brutally kills Yelasari Bhanu and his henchmen. Bhupathi, who is impressed with Kattula Katamarayudu's valour, decided to give his hand to his daughter Avantika. The film ends with the marriage of Kattula Katamarayudu and his brothers."

        "content": "Bad Times at the El Royale is a 2018 American neo-noir thriller film written, directed, and produced by Drew Goddard. It stars an ensemble cast consisting of Jeff Bridges, Cynthia Erivo, Dakota Johnson, Jon Hamm, Cailee Spaeny, Lewis Pullman, and Chris Hemsworth. The plot centers on six strangers and an employee at the El Royale, a hotel located along the California\u2013Nevada border, who arrive with dark personal secrets that eventually intersect on a fateful night in the late 1960s. The film explores themes on morality, faith, and redemption, with the state border and other visualizations representing the concept of right and wrong. Goddard began writing the spec script for the film in November 2016, and compiled a list of songs into his screenplay. After telling major studios to avoid buying the script if they could not buy the licenses for each piece of music, he sold it to 20th Century Fox in March 2017. Principal photography started in January 2018 with cinematographer Seamus McGarvey and took place until April, mostly on a large studio set in Burnaby. The El Royale hotel was built entirely on set under the supervision of production designer Martin Whist, who had envisioned designing a perfectly symmetrical hotel. Additional filming took place in the United States. During post-production, editing was completed by Lisa Lassek and the musical score was composed by Michael Giacchino. Bad Times at the El Royale marketing efforts include posters, trailers, and television advertisements, stylized to evoke nostalgia of the noir genre and to make the film stand out against other films in theaters. The film premiered in Los Angeles on September 22, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 12. The film underperformed at the box office, grossing $31.9\u00a0million against a $32\u00a0million budget, in part due to its competition and \"R-rating\" from the Motion Picture Association. Critics praised the film for its ensemble cast, soundtrack, and cinematography, but criticized its lengthy runtime of 141 minutes. It received various awards and nominations, most notably at the 45th Saturn Awards, for its writing, acting, cinematography, and music."

        "content": "The El Royale, once popular with the wealthy until losing its gambling license, is a hotel that straddles the California\u2013Nevada border. In 1959, Felix O'Kelly hides a money bag under the floorboards of his room. A man he recognizes arrives and shoots him dead. Ten years later, Catholic priest Daniel Flynn, singer Darlene Sweet, salesman Laramie Seymour Sullivan, and hippie Emily Summerspring arrive at the hotel, now run solely by heroin addict Miles Miller, and book separate rooms. Upon checking into the honeymoon suite, Laramie begins removing wiretaps but unexpectedly finds a second set as well. After stealing the hotel's master key, he discovers a secret corridor from which every room can be observed through one-way mirrors and filmed with a camera. Laramie sees Darlene singing, Daniel removing the floorboards of his room, and Emily holding a young woman captive. In the parking lot, Laramie calls into the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), revealing himself to be Special Agent Dwight Broadbeck. He is instructed by J. Edgar Hoover to focus on his mission of collecting the surveillance materials the FBI had planted and ignore the kidnapping. Believing the mission has been compromised, Dwight is also told to prevent the guests from leaving. To do so, Dwight disables all the cars. Daniel invites Darlene to join him for dinner in the hotel lounge. There, Darlene says she is practicing for a performance in Reno and Daniel reveals that his memory is deteriorating. While Daniel is getting drinks, Darlene sees him spiking her beverage and she knocks him unconscious with a bottle. Miles later finds and revives Daniel and tells him that he wants to undertake a confession but Daniel refuses. Miles, looking for the missing master key, leads Daniel to the secret corridor, explaining that he used to regularly film intimate encounters that he had to send to his superiors. Miles also admits to having withheld one incriminating film of a deceased public figure who had been kind to him. When Daniel leaves to evaluate said film, Miles witnesses through the one-way mirror Dwight attempting to rescue Emily's hostage, who is revealed to be her younger sister, Rose. Emily kills Dwight with a shotgun, which also shoots out the mirror, revealing the corridor and injuring Miles. Before these events, Emily had forcibly removed her sister from a dangerous cult. In the present, Rose secretly calls its leader, Billy Lee, to tell him where she is. A witness to Dwight's murder, Darlene tries to escape but fails due to his tampering with her vehicle. Daniel arrives and reveals to her that he is Dock O'Kelly, imprisoned since a bank robbery in 1959. Recently paroled, he arrived in disguise to retrieve the money hidden by his brother Felix. Due to Dock's failing memory, he picked the wrong room and tried to drug Darlene to gain access to hers. To gain her trust, Dock offers to split the cash with Darlene. After retrieving the money, Billy and his cult arrive and take the pair, Emily, and Miles hostage. In a flashback, Billy tells his cult the dangers of following the rules set by society. As a demonstration, he gets Rose to fight another girl for the chance to sleep with him as a saddened Emily watches nearby. In the present, a compliant Rose watches as Billy interrogates the group and finds the film, which he realizes is more valuable than the money. Beginning to terrorize the group, Billy kills Emily in a life-or-death game of roulette between her and Miles. Before Billy completes another round of roulette, Dock attacks him, a melee ensues, and a fire begins to spread. When Darlene implores Miles to pick up a gun and help, it is revealed that he served in the Vietnam War as a sniper and killed 123 people. A defiant Miles kills Billy and his followers but a distraught Rose stabs Miles in the stomach before being shot by Dock. Darlene tells \"Father Flynn\" to absolve Miles of the guilt over his wartime actions before he dies. After Dock complies, the pair toss the film into the fire before leaving the El Royale with the money. Sometime later in Reno, Dock attends Darlene's soul performance at a nightclub."

        "content": "As examined by Kyle Kizu from The Hollywood Reporter, the filmography of writer and director Drew Goddard has tackled several times the deconstruction of a specific genre. When focusing on the 2018 film, he said that it was the filmmaker's \"most controlled and fruitful piece of deconstruction\" as it was able to present its thesis, of \"what looks plain and ordinary hides something beneath\", with its opening scene through a literal metaphor of a man deconstructing a room. While The A.V. Clubs Katie Rife noted that the film attempted to deconstruct its neo-noir genre, but that it was instead \"a structurally ambitious example of same\", Matthew Razak of Flixist wrote that the film purposely avoided deconstructing its main genre as it \"mashes together a whole wealth of genres and delivers an utterly unique, unpredictable, and unexpected movie that never stays still long enough to be anything but itself\". In a negative light, Andrew Paredes from ABS-CBNnews.com said that the film's runtime made it difficult to analyze, and that the film could have been \"both a deconstruction and a commentary\" or neither, and that only Goddard could say. When asked if he had focused on deconstructing the genres in his film like he previously did with the horror-comedy The Cabin in the Woods in 2011, Goddard said \"It's funny because in both cases that was not conscious either way. I just sort of go with what feels right for the story. Cabin was very aggressive in its approach. Whereas, in this case, [...] it just sort of came out inherently. I didn't want to make it about the genre.\""

        "content": "A major aspect of the film was its visualization of each character's morality. One of its main cues to this was the presence of the California-Nevada border dividing the hotel. In one of the opening scenes, Darlene Sweet takes her time walking across the state line and crosses it only with the help of Father Daniel Flynn, never actually stepping on the line itself. However, characters such as cult leader Billy Lee calmly walk in between the line without a second thought. To further illustrate this idea, cinematographer Seamus McGarvey used color to give each character a \"photographic signature\". With this process, he assigned Billy to the color red for the significance of \"impending doom, blood, and death\", black and white to Daniel to tell his distinctions between the truth and deception, and bright colors to Darlene for her character's hopefulness and purity. Goddard said he placed the story in 1969 due to the circumstances and tensions during the decade while drawing inspiration on morality from the techniques used by the Coen brothers."

        "content": "From Vox, film critic Alissa Wilkinson listed the themes of Bad Times at the El Royale as tackling \"religion, salvation, and who we really are\", while writing that the film was about \"humanity's drive to find redemption\". Believing that the state line served as the \"existential crossroads\" each character was facing, she came to the conclusion that the hotel was a \"stand-in for purgatory\". Overall, she noted that the main point of the use of religion in the film was the idea that confessing would help the characters \"[speak] freely about their past misdeeds in time for someone else to see them for who they really are\". Tracy Palmer, from Signal Horizon, similarly evaluated the story and arrived at the assumption that Daniel was, in fact, God testing six people in purgatory, and as \"Darlene never commits any sin beyond hating herself and aiding a criminal find his money [...] she is rewarded for her charity, and acceptance of self by singing for an audience what she wants, how she wants to look for eternity.\" Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, Ciara Wardlow said the film \"has a lot to say about faith\". She began her analysis with the mention that the reveal of Daniel not being a priest but bank robber Dock O'Kelly as being similar to \"other invocations of religion\" turning out to be misleading. She explained the decision of Dwight Broadbeck to violate his orders to potentially rescue a kidnapping victim, as his attempt to do what is right after reciting to his daughter a revised version of the prayer \"Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep\". After concluding that all the characters in the film were having their faith tested, such as Miles Miller seeking forgiveness for his sins and Billy playing God as a cult leader, Wardlow cited Pascal's wager to summarize the major theme of the project: \"Bad Times repeatedly asks what is 'goodness' even, or forgiveness? And who is qualified to give it, for that matter?\" Furthermore, a journalist named Jasmine from SSZee Media studied the film and wrote that it was \"a study of religion\" as every character was having a \"crisis of faith\". Focusing on the introduction of Billy Lee and how he uses religion to take advantage of his followers and to pose as a God himself, \"walking the line between good and evil\", Jasmine noted the similarity of his followers to the \"disciples following Jesus\". Also analyzing a scene in which a shot was framed to make Billy appear to have a halo on his head, she interpreted that his character was created to focus more on threatening appearances through his movements and words, calling it \"the performance of Chris Hemsworth's career\"."

        "content": "A film reel containing a recently deceased person in an intimate act is destroyed in the film's finale. The choice to never tell the audience the identity of the person on the film was examined by both critics and filmgoers. Screen Rant Zak Wojnar said the scene would lead the audience to question \"if it should actually matter\". He said it was possible the person on the film was John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, or Martin Luther King Jr., major political figures who were all assassinated in the 1960s. In his conclusion, Wojnar said the \"key takeaway of the film is that great men aren't perfect. Good people can do bad things, bad people can do good things, and there's more to human beings than the binary poles of righteous and wicked.\" Lia Beck from Bustle, on the other hand, closely examined the possibility of JFK being the person on the tape, as he had been rumored to have had an affair with Marilyn Monroe in the 1960s, who appears in the film through a photograph. They also pointed out that the hotel the El Royale is based on, the Cal Neva Lodge & Casino, was frequently visited by the Kennedy family. Goddard said his choice to leave the person on the tape ambiguous was to move the focus on Darlene, her rant towards Billy, and her character as a whole."

        "content": "Goddard began writing the spec script to Bad Times at the El Royale in November 2016. To prepare for the film financially, he pitched the project with a budget and a selection of songs he wanted to be included. On March 8, 2017, 20th Century Fox bought the screenplay, accepted Goddard's terms, and set the budget at $32\u00a0million. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the script was only given to top studio executives, with potential buyers having to read it off a tablet before returning it to a courier. Goddard was also attached to direct for TSG Entertainment and Goddard Textiles, producing alongside Jeremy Latcham. Mary McLaglen was an executive producer. The film's location was influenced by the Cal Neva Lodge & Casino, a hotel located in between the California\u2013Nevada border. Goddard said he wanted to work with an ensemble cast after finishing The Martian with lead actor Matt Damon because he \"wanted to play around with a large cast so that you don't know who the protagonist is.\" On further inspirations, Goddard said his cast and crew watched several films throughout the film's production, including Casablanca (1942), Out of the Past (1947), Chinatown (1974), and Barton Fink (1991), along with reading several novels from Jim Thompson, Agatha Christie, Dashiell Hammett, James Ellroy, and Flannery O'Connor. He also compared the film to The Good Place, a television comedy series he executive produced, and said they were \"two sides of the same coin. They're both about characters struggling to be better people and trying to figure out what it means to be a better person. One is a very broad comedy, the other is a dark noir. But at the core, they are about characters.\""

        "content": "Goddard chose to spend more time developing his characters than looking for actors who would best fit the roles. Jeff Bridges was the first person to receive the script, and on August 23, 2017, it was announced he had been in negotiations to star alongside Chris Hemsworth, who had previously worked with the director on The Cabin in the Woods. Actors who were also being considered for lead roles included Beyonc\u00e9, Tom Holland, and newcomer Cailee Spaeny; the latter was officially cast on August 24. Cynthia Erivo was first considered for a lead role while working on Widows. She submitted two auditions tapes to casting director Carmen Cuba, and was cast on August 29, 2017. When asked about Erivo's audition process, Goddard said he \"felt the hair stand up on the back of my neck. It was pretty exciting the day she walked in, that's for sure.\" Erivo would go on to help Goddard write a scene in the climax of the film in which her character gives a speech towards the primary antagonist portrayed by Hemsworth, explaining that as the only lead character who is a woman of color, that if her character \"doesn't have a moment where she can just speak, it will seem as though we don't want her to\". In January 2018, Dakota Johnson joined the film; Russell Crowe signed on to star but dropped out shortly before filming began. To quickly find his replacement, Jon Hamm was contacted while attending the 2017 Sundance Film Festival and was given a day to read the screenplay and another to decide whether he wanted to star. After accepting, he had less than a week to remember fourteen pages of dialogue before filming began. Hamm noted a major reason he accepted to star was to work with Bridges and said, \"I've wanted to work with [Bridges] since I was in college or even younger. So to get that opportunity, you gotta jump with both feet\". In February, Nick Offerman and Mark O'Brien were spotted on set. Lewis Pullman was confirmed to star in May 2018."

Glicker said his job was to create \"real tension\" in each character \"between their outward appearance and who they really are\". To create the design for Hamm's character, a salesman, Glicker and his production crew researched different types of salespeople and used the documentary Salesman (1969) as inspiration, before deciding that his attire, described as being \"very American\", would change as the temperature in the film changed as well. On the other hand, the clothing of Erivo's character, lounge singer Darlene Sweet, was purposely created to look imperfect to reflect her declining career. Glicker said he had to screen test each piece of clothing due to conditions presented in the film, such as the weather, environment, and lighting, and that he spent time at the library researching different types of clothing from the 1960s. Summarizing his work, Glicker felt that actors wearing his created costumes were \"infused with truthful information [...] to experience that character's life without inhibition\"."

        "content": "Principal photography took place between January 29 and April 6, 2018, in areas around Vancouver, British Columbia, where an incentive was given in the form of a 28% refundable tax credit. The film was shot under the working title Purple Harvest and filmed in chronological order to improve continuity. After working on The Greatest Showman (2017), Seamus McGarvey was hired to bring out the \"1960s look\" and \"beautiful colors\" of each set. Shot with Kodak 35mm film with a Panaflex XL camera on a 2.39:1 aspect ratio, McGarvey used Panavision C Series and E series anamorphic lenses to capture the film. Several actors took pay cuts to complete the project and allow the production to \"take big creative bets\". For the first few days of the shoot, filming for the main bank robbery sequence took place in Pioneer Avenue in Agassiz, British Columbia. The following week, cast members were moved to Mammoth Studios, a  sound stage in Burnaby featuring a  set of the El Royale. Early in the production, the film crew realized they could not find a real place with perfect symmetry to film, and Goddard also wanted the weather to be controllable, thus the decision to build the set in Burnaby. The set was created under the supervision of production designer Martin Whist, who had previously worked with Goddard on Cloverfield (2008) and The Cabin in the Woods. Each hotel room of the set was designed to be unique to each character, particularly through their wallpaper, with Darlene's room being the most vibrant. It took eight months to plan a tracking shot in which Hamm's character discovers the secret corridor of the El Royale and watches the hotel guests through one-way mirrors. Rehearsals of the scene began in November 2017, with the cast working with a model of the hotel and small figurines to research how to perfect the timing. Due to the complexity of the scene, in which Erivo was singing live for the five-minute continuous shot, cast and crew members had to move silently in unison while wearing \"padded shoes and quiet clothes\". Using \"30% reflective glass\" for the one-way mirrors, the scene took an entire day between twenty-seven takes to accomplish. An additional scene in which Erivo's character sings to cover up noises caused by Bridges's character took twenty takes to complete. Furthermore, the set of a scene involving Billy Lee and his cult talking around a bonfire was built outside of the parking lot of the hotel set. The scene showing the first interaction between Daniel and Darlene was one of the last scenes shot for the film as it was built on location to have the scene occur during the day; every other scene taking place inside the hotel was shot on the set at Mammoth Studios. The film's climax scene in which the hotel burns down was planned using fire retardant materials by Whist's brother Joel, a special effects coordinator. The last scenes that were shot for the film involved flashbacks; the Vietnam War scene, originally going to be shot in Thailand, was filmed at the Polsa Rosa Movie Ranch in Acton, Ontario, while the FBI scene, doctor's office scene, and jail scene were shot in an armory from the Canadian Army. Additional filming in Los Angeles and north of Malibu, California, took place for three days where scenes involving a flower walk and a beach were shot. McGarvey said he used a wide aspect ratio to shine focus on the ensemble cast."

As a result, Lassek was permitted to edit the project as filming took place while in a workspace above the set. Due to the delay, the footage shown in the film on television monitors was shot first so the original film stock could be projected on said monitors weeks later. After post-production concluded near the start of October 2018, the finished product reached an Avid DNxHD 115 resolution.

He described the film as \"a love letter to music\" and served as a music supervisor. Goddard had Erivo sing her songs live on set with the belief that without it, \"the movie would not work\". With Entertainment Weekly, Goddard said that the music was \"almost like the eighth character in the movie. It serves the function of a chorus in a Shakespearean play. It actually is a key part of the emotional fabric of the film.\" As a result, the production crew had each song playing during filming on loudspeakers; Pullman and Bridges said they had originally read the script while listening to the songs in the background as a \"great way to set the tone\". In introducing the character of cult leader Billy Lee with \"Twelve Thirty\", Goddard said he wanted to provide a metaphorical connection with the character, as the song is \"very bright and seductive, but when you really listen to what the words are saying, there's an incredible darkness\". The film score was composed by Michael Giacchino, who had met Goddard while working on television series Alias and Lost. Both the score and its accompanying soundtrack album were released on digital download by Milan Records and Republic Records, on October 12, 2018. The original tracklist for the soundtrack featured eleven prerecorded songs, while a digital re-release on November 30, 2018, included two additional songs; \"This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)\" and \"Hold On, I'm Comin'\", performed by Erivo in the film. Following its re-release, the soundtrack received positive reviews from critics. Writing for Polygon, Karen Han called it \"one of the year's best\". Angelica Florio from Bustle said that \"between the music [...] and Darlene's show-stopping performances, you definitely get the sense that the song selection was key for Goddard\"."

A teaser for the film was publicized on June 7, 2018, with Entertainment Weekly calling it a \"tense first look\" and IndieWire comparing its premise to Clue (1985) and the television series Room 104. On August 28, an official trailer was released, which Collider described as \"fantastic\" as it was \"more delightful for the fact that it reveals pretty much nothing beyond the basic setup and the idea that none of these strangers is who they at first appear to be\". In a trailer breakdown with Empire, who described it as an \"instant blast of glossy genre intrigue\", Goddard revealed the names of each character and said, \"If it was really up to me, I'd say the less you know the better. I take very great care in giving the audience something they've never seen before and surprising the audience, and taking them to places that they do not expect to go.\" Promotional and theatrical posters for the film were released extensively to broadcast the ensemble cast. On June 26, 2018, eight character posters were unveiled by the studio, with Ben Pearson from /Film noting the \"progression of the setting sun\" and \"how the amount of light in each poster seems to mirror what we know about the characters so far\". On August 13, seven additional character posters along with an official theatrical poster were released featuring \"closeups of the brooding main characters lit by the title's neon glow\". On August 28, a second theatrical poster was publicized to coincide with the release of the official trailer. Television spots began airing on September 4, 2018. In the week starting September 17, seven commercials made 223.4 million impressions across 28 networks, particularly on NBC and FOX. In the final week of September, Bad Times at the El Royale had eleven versions of similar advertisements aired 773 times nationwide, gaining an attention score of 93.42 (as well as an attention index of 109). In the first week of October, eighteen commercials made over 378 million impressions. With its following week from October 8 to October 14 being its last time as one of the top five projects with the highest commercial spending, twenty-two commercials aired a total of 1,331 times on 34 networks, specifically on Adult Swim and NBC, bringing the film's overall television advertisement spending to $24.46\u00a0million. On December 21, 2018, a 10-minute \"extended preview\" scene of the film was released, with Collider questioning the studio's decision, writing that it was \"something they should have done back in October, but it is what it is\". The Hollywood Reporter Chris Thilk analyzed the marketing techniques of Bad Times at the El Royale, summarizing the fact that the studio was \"[betting] on noir nostalgia\" to attract audiences. In what he believed was \"established neon-heavy branding\", Thilk said each of the released posters was \"hinting in some way toward the nature or arc\" of each character. On the trailers, he wrote that viewers were not able to \"describe what's going\" and were left \"raising lots of questions\". After discussing the initial footage being released at CinemaCon and San Diego Comic-Con, where filmgoers were also allowed to enter a lottery for the chance of seeing an exclusive screening of the film, Thilk tackled the various clips, featurettes, and television spots produced to advertise the film. In his summary, he wrote that the marketing campaign \"promoted a strong cast and a wicked sense of humor\", and that 20th Century Fox \"has embraced that to sell it to those looking for something a bit different at the theater\"."

The film's runtime of 141 minutes was chosen after negative scores appeared during test screenings where audiences were given a viewing of the film with a shorter runtime. Though the film was originally scheduled to be released on October 5, 2018, 20th Century Fox postponed the film's release by a week to October 12 to avoid competition with the October 5 releases of Venom and A Star Is Born. After it opened in theaters, the film was chosen to introduce the 13th Rome Film Festival, serving as its Italian premiere. At the ceremony, Goddard said his film contained \"parallels to the #MeToo movement\" on the topic of abusing power. 20th Century Studios Home Entertainment released the film on Digital HD via digital distribution on December 18, 2018, before giving it a physical release on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on January 1, 2019.

The film was criticized for its runtime, character beats, and pacing. Additionally, Goddard's screenplay for the film received mixed reviews, with some praising it for its dialogue and use of violence, others comparing it to Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction (1994) and Stanley Kubrick's The Killing (1956), and several critics finding its third act failed to deliver the ending it was building towards. From NPR, Simon Abrams noted Goddard's directorial style, and how he was able to keep his \"hyper-compartmentalized plot moving forward so swiftly\" despite its moments of tension and significant plot points. On the other hand, Glenn Kenny from RogerEbert.com did not enjoy the film's finale, writing that it was \"an unfortunately apt demonstration of what can befall a clever filmmaker who gets too clever\". Smaller aspects of the film, such as its soundtrack and cinematography, received praise. Critics agreed that Seamus McGarvey's cinematography made the film visually appealing because of its composition and color palette. The film's performances, especially those from Erivo and Bridges, also received praise and were mostly well-received. While The A.V.

Collider Adam Chitwood said Erivo's acting made Bad Times at the El Royale \"one of the best films of the year\". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Leah Greenblatt gave praise to Erivo for her \"steely charisma and gorgeous powerhouse of a voice\". Abrams also gave positive feedback to the film for its ability to give each member of the ensemble cast enough time to act out their \"best\", with Manohla Dargis from The New York Times writing that \"the performances and the visual style keep you easily engaged [...] Goddard keeps everything smoothly, ebbing and flowing as the characters separate and join together, but at some point [...] you want something more substantial\"."

Earlier Peter is a care-free brat who neither has any interest in his father's Mrudangam making business nor in his own career. He started wooing a nurse called Saara while she kept him some distance due to his approach. Then one day, on his father's insistence he went to deliver mrudangam to Vembu Iyer's concert where he was allowed to watch his program. After observing Iyer's concert, Peter started admiring him and decided to join as a student to learn mrudangam from him. After observing Peter, Iyer had understood that he has talent but rejected him due to lack of discipline and consistency. To prove Iyer wrong, Peter tried hard to change himself which constoned by his mother and worried about his future. Finally Iyer allowed Peter as his student. Later Peter was mistreated by Iyer's Assistant Mani because of his lower caste. It was noticed by Iyer, who warns him to be good with his students. Mani confesses his dissatisfaction over him saying he did not support his career as mrudangam player and used him. This angered Iyer, who sacked him from the job in front of Peter, so Mani swears revenge on Iyer and Peter for his humiliation. Later Peter became good friend with Nandagopal 'Nandu' a NRI and a Harvard University PhD dropout who came to learn Mrudangam from Iyer. Meanwhile, Mani joined as a Judge in a classical music instrument reality show called 'Sangeetha Samrat' with the help of his younger sister Anjana who is a crooked socialite and works as a VJ. Peter was very passionate about the beats of Mrudangam and became one of the favorite students of Iyer. Meanwhile, Saara realized her love for Peter and they start dating. Anjana sets a trap to humiliate Iyer. She invited Nandu to perform on her reality show and makes him believe that it was telecasted only in the USA. Nandu came along with Peter, who consistently warns him to not perform without their teacher's permission. After knowing that it was a trap to humiliate them Nandu leaves the place without any warning to Peter. Without knowing the facts, Peter enters the studio to find Nandu, but he was focused on \"live\". Then with no option left, Peter gets ready to play mrudangam which gets severely humiliated by Mani and Anjana, making him seem useless and directly criticize Iyer. After knowing the issue, Iyer questions Peter on why he went to perform on the stage. Peter takes the blame on himself to save Nandu. The angered Iyer bangs Peter out saying it is a real humiliation for his musical knowledge for believing in such a useless student. Later at Nandu's home, Nandu blames Peter for his mistakes and Peter challenges Nandu he will be overpowered by him one day.

Titled Sarvam Thaala Mayam, G. V. Prakash Kumar was signed on to play the lead role of a percussionist in the film, while A. R. Rahman was selected to compose the film's music. Pre-production work took place in mid-2016, and the team finalised Sai Pallavi to play the female lead role. Other actors including Nedumudi Venu and Cheenu Mohan were also approached to play key roles in the film, but production failed to take off in November 2016 as planned and the project was delayed. In March 2017, Menon denied that the film was dropped and noted that a promotional photo shoot with Prakash Kumar was imminent. Prakash Kumar revealed that the story was set in two states and was inspired by incidents from the lives of real musicians. During the period, Prakash Kumar also took professional mridangam lessons from percussionist Umayalpuram Sivaraman to equip himself for the character. After further brief delays, the film was officially launched on 29 November 2017 and the shoot began thereafter. Sai Pallavi's unavailability meant that the team replaced her with Aparna Balamurali, after Menon was impressed with her performance in the Malayalam film, Maheshinte Prathikaaram (2016), and called her for a successful audition. An ensemble cast of Nedumudi Venu, Santha Dhananjayan, Vineeth, Kumaravel, Sumesh and Athira was also announced with the launch, while Ravi Yadav and Anthony were confirmed as the film's cinematographer and editor respectively. Actress Dhivyadharshini also later joined the film during the first schedule, which carried on until the end of 2017."

It stars Helena Howard in the titular role, alongside Molly Parker as her teacher and Miranda July as her mother. Howard plays a teenage actor, Madeline, who is encouraged by her theater director Evangeline (Parker) to blur the lines between the character she is playing and her actual identity. The film is known for its experimental visuals and the improvisational process Decker used to create the story, not unlike the characters themselves. The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2018. It was released on August 10, 2018, by Oscilloscope Laboratories. The film received critical acclaim, particularly for Howard's performance, which was hailed by IndieWire as one of the 50 best performances of the 2010s decade."

        "content": "Madeline is a lonely teenager who is part of a professional acting ensemble creating an experimental theater performance about The Three Little Pigs using improvisation. She enjoys the company of the other actors and their director Evangeline, and dreads having to go home to her mother Regina who doesn't understand Madeline and often starts arguments. One day at rehearsal, Madeline confesses to Evangeline that she had a dream in which she placed a hot iron on her mother. Struck by this dream, Evangeline decides to have the performers recreate it in an improv exercise. Madeline gets overwhelmed at how her life is conflating with her art and wanders out of the theater alone while Regina looks for her. After she finds Madeline, Regina discovers that Madeline's prescription for an unspecified mental illness has run out, and she struggles to get it quickly refilled. Evangeline gradually makes Madeline's life the central focus of the theater performance they are devising. During a promotional photoshoot, Evangeline asks Regina to pose in the photo with Madeline. One rehearsal ends early, so Madeline goes to Evangeline's house for a birthday party, where she shows off her acting skills to the uncomfortable guests and hits on Evangeline's husband. After speaking with Evangeline about their mutual feelings of self-consciousness and vulnerability, Madeline reveals that she wants to leave the group and Evangeline agrees that Madeline should take a break from acting for a bit. Madeline is relieved at her new found creative freedom but is dismayed when Evangeline stops by Madeline's house. She and Regina end up bonding over a couple glasses of wine, and Evangeline convinces Regina that she would be an excellent actor if she tried it. She tells Regina to stop by rehearsal the next day. All three women show up to the rehearsal, and Evangeline has them do an exercise where everyone pretends to be Regina, but Madeline's version of her mother is too real and it hits a nerve: Regina leaves the rehearsal crying. Evangeline loves how real the emotions are, and asks the performers to recreate that scene again while she takes an important phone call outside. The performers are disgusted by the way Evangeline has been exploiting Madeline's emotions and identity, and they lock the door. They quickly devise a performance for Evangeline: a confrontational journey through the winding rehearsal building. At first Evangeline objects to being shoved around by everyone, but eventually despite struggling, she is used as part of the performance. The troupe ends up outside in the street, all dancing together in the sunlight as Madeline walks in the opposite direction."

        "content": "Josephine Decker directed the film and wrote its screenplay. Camera work was handled by Ashley Connor, and music was composed by Caroline Shaw. The film's producers were Krista Parris and Elizabeth Rao. Decker and Howard first met in 2014 at a teen arts festival that the director was judging. 15-year-old Howard performed a monologue from Blackbird by David Harrower, and Decker was so moved by the performance that she began to cry, which caused Howard to cry, too. Decker told her that it was the best performance she'd ever seen, and that she'd like them to work together on a film. The film's story began as a fictionalized telling of Howard's own life, but Decker also wanted to explore her own anxieties as an artist. In her previous work Bi the Way and Flames, she had experiences where artists told others' stories in ways that she felt were exploitative, and she wanted to explore whether it would be possible to tell someone else's story faithfully. In 2014, she began a series of workshops to devise the story, based on techniques she had learned at the Pig Iron Theatre Company in Philadelphia and the School of Making Thinking. Decker, Howard, and eleven other actors met about nine different times over the course of seven months. They used improvisation to create a variety of different scenes, many of which never ended up in the final film, and explored each performer's personal experiences, such as with mental illness. Cinematographer Ashley Connor also participated in some of the workshops because Decker wanted the camera to also be treated as a character. After all the workshops, Decker sat down and wrote a script that incorporated the best scenes they had created. In one draft of the script, she included a real-life event that had happened between her and Howard, and when she realized that it had crossed a line between the character Madeline and the actual Helena Howard, she decided to take the script in a more fictional direction. Decker realized from that experience that the character Evangeline would have enjoyed crossing boundaries like that, so she started incorporating that desire into her character. Decker continued this collaborative style during production. At the beginning of each day of shooting, the cast and crew met for a short meditation and a chance for anyone to voice concerns they had with the production process. Many of the scenes were improvised, so Connor and gaffer David April lit the sets in such a way that the actors and camera could freely move anywhere without a light being in the shot. The visual style of the film incorporated camera techniques that Connor and Decker had discovered working on previous films together. Connor created a custom camera rig that allowed her to manipulate the focus in new ways, which Chris O'Falt of Indiewire described as \"an almost liquid-like aspect to the focus, and the image if often slightly doubled or warped, while out-of-focus translucent objects come into the edges of frame to cause pockets of soft, sometimes colorful blurring.\" Harrison Atkins was the editor for the first four months of post production and made over a hundred different cuts of the movie exploring various ways the story could be told, but when he had to leave to work on a different show, Decker took on the editing herself. Six months went by and she still wasn't satisfied with the film, so she brought on producer Liz Rao to help with editing for five weeks. With only two weeks left until the deadline for submitting to the Sundance Film Festival, Decker realized there was still a major problem with the ending, so she brought on David Barker for some last-minute changes. Spike Jonze and Mike Mills also offered advice during post-production."

Writing in The Village Voice, Bilge Ebiri called Madeline's Madeline \"the best thing I saw at Sundance this year\". IndieWire reviewer David Ehrlich described the film as \"one of the boldest and most invigorating American films of the 21st century\". The New York Times called it a \"seductive, disturbing, exasperating movie,\" noting it blurs the line between \"fantasy and reality, certainly, but also between authenticity and artifice, theater and therapy, art and life.\" The film was well-received by Entertainment Weekly, which praised the \"nuanced\" portrayal of the protagonist and her growth as a \"self-possessed\" character dealing with dominating authority figures. WBUR in Boston named it one of the best films of 2018, describing the plot as \"three women perform an intricate psychological dance, with two locked in a vicious tug-of-war for a third's affections.\" The Boston Globe gave it 4/5 stars and called it \"stunning.\" It received a mixed review from Variety, with the review praising how it addressed multiple issues such as identity and a \"form of penance by its director, Josephine Decker, for appropriating the lives of her collaborators.\" However, it \"mistakes intimacy for honesty, and it mis-assumes that audiences care nearly as much about the creative process as actors and directors do.\" In 2019, Howard's performance was hailed by IndieWire as one of the 50 best performances of the 2010s decade."
