Common additions include cabbage, meat, and seafood, and toppings include okonomiyaki sauce (made with Worcestershire sauce), aonori (dried seaweed flakes), katsuobushi (bonito flakes), Japanese mayonnaise, and pickled ginger. Okonomiyaki is mainly associated with two distinct variants from Hiroshima or the Kansai region of Japan, but is widely available throughout the country, with toppings and batters varying by area. The name is derived from the word , meaning \"how you like\" or \"what you like\", and , meaning \"cooked\". It is an example of  ( in the Kansai dialect), or flour-based Japanese cuisine. A liquid based okonomiyaki, popular in Kyoto, is called monjayaki. Outside of Japan, it can also be found served in Manila, Taipei, Bangkok, and Jakarta by street vendors."

        "content": "A thin cr\u00eape-like confection called  may be an early precursor to okonomiyaki. Records of the word  appear as far back as the 16th century, as written about by tea master Sen no Riky\u016b, and though the dish's ingredients are unclear, it may have included fu (wheat gluten). By the late Edo period (1603\u20131867), funoyaki referred to a thin cr\u00eape baked on a cooking pot, with miso basted on one side. This confection is the ancestor of the modern confections , which is also called  in Kyoto and Osaka, and taiko-yaki (also known as imagawayaki), which both use , a sweet bean paste. In the Meiji era (1868\u20131912), , a related confection, was popular with children at , shops selling cheap sweets. This was made by drawing letters (monji) or pictures with flour batter on a teppan (iron griddle) and adding ingredients of choice. The confectionary was also called , from the onomatopoeia of the stall sellers beating drums to attract customers. The first appearance of the word \"okonomiyaki\" was at a shop in Osaka in the 1930s. After the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake when people lacked amenities, it became a pastime to cook these cr\u00eapes, and after World War II (when there was a short supply of rice) okonomiyaki emerged as an inexpensive and filling dish for all ages, often with savory toppings, such as meat, seafood, and vegetables. This \"okonomiyaki boom\" saw household equipment and ingredients for the dish become commercially available. Monjiyaki also developed into the related modern dish , which has a more runny batter due to more added water, resulting in a different cooked consistency. The  (cheap Western-style cuisine) of Kyoto, which developed in the Taish\u014d period (1912\u20131926), may have produced an early form of modern savory okonomiyaki in the form of a pancake with Worcestershire sauce and chopped scallion."

The batter is made of flour, grated nagaimo (a long type of yam), dashi or water, eggs, shredded cabbage, and usually contains other ingredients such as green onion, meat (usually thinly sliced pork belly or American bacon), octopus, squid, shrimp, vegetables, konjac, mochi, or cheese. It is sometimes compared to an omelette or a pancake and is sometimes referred to as a \"Japanese pizza\" or \"Osaka soul food\". The dish can be prepared in advance, allowing customers to use a teppan or special hotplates to fry after mixing the ingredients. They may also have a diner-style counter where the cook prepares the dish in front of the customers. It is prepared much like a pancake. The batter and other ingredients are pan-fried on both sides on a teppan using metal spatulas that are later used to cut the dish when it has finished cooking. Cooked okonomiyaki is topped with ingredients that include okonomiyaki sauce (made with Worcestershire sauce), aonori (seaweed flakes), katsuobushi (bonito flakes), Japanese mayonnaise, and pickled ginger (beni sh\u014dga). When served with a layer of fried noodles (either yakisoba or udon), the resulting dish is called , the name of which may be derived from the English word \"modern\" or as a contraction of , meaning \"a lot\" or \"piled high\" signifying the volume of food from having both noodles and okonomiyaki.  is a thinner variation of okonomiyaki made with a great deal of scallions, comparable to Korean pajeon and Chinese green onion pancakes. A variation called kashimin-yaki is made of chicken and tallow instead of pork in Kishiwada, Osaka. In Hamamatsu, takuan (pickled daikon) is mixed in okonomiyaki. Stewed sweet kintoki-mame is mixed in okonomiyaki in Tokushima Prefecture."

Optional items such as squid, octopus, dried bonito flakes, and other seafood, as well as nori flakes or powder, mung bean sprouts, egg, chicken, cheese, and other ingredients, depending on the preferences of the cook and the customer. Noodles (yakisoba, udon) are also used as a topping with fried egg and a generous amount of okonomiyaki sauce. The amount of cabbage used is usually three to four times the amount used in the Osaka style. It starts out piled very high and is pushed down as the cabbage cooks. The order of the layers may vary slightly depending on the chef's style and preference, and ingredients vary depending on the preference of the customer. This style is also called Hiroshima-yaki or Hiroshima-okonomi.

The Original Ninfa's was started by Ninfa Rodr\u00edguez Laurenzo, a Mexican-American woman, in a tortilla factory. Ninfa Laurenzo became a full-time restaurateur and the tortilla factory closed. Mama Ninfa is widely credited with popularizing the fajita among Houstonians. Dai Huynh of the Houston Chronicle said that the Ninfa's locations opened after the first two restaurants \"failed to attract the following of earlier restaurants.\" Tom Laurenzo said that the Laurenzo family never became very wealthy while it controlled the Ninfa's restaurants.

        "content": "In 1973, Ninfa Laurenzo, a widow with five children, established Ninfa's, then a taco stand, as a side business due to financial troubles with her original core business, a tortilla factory. Laurenzo's factory was losing  money, and she needed to update her equipment in order to comply with new regulations. When Laurenzo decided to establish a restaurant, she applied for loans at several banks. The banks turned her down, so a friend in Mexico City loaned her several thousand dollars. Laurenzo divided the factory facility in half. The back of the factory continued to act as a tortilla factory, while the front had ten tables and 40 chairs. Laurenzo used discarded second hand furniture and pots and pans from her kitchen in the restaurant. The Ninfa's restaurant opened in July of that year. The cuisine at Ninfa's differed from the cuisine of Tex Mex restaurants at the time. The restaurant almost closed after a fire struck one week after its initial opening. Dai Huynh of the Houston Chronicle said \"Word quickly spread about the East End restaurant with good, cheap food and an outgoing Mexican Mama who greeted diners with open arms.\" Laurenzo tripled the space of the original Ninfa's and closed the tortilla-making operations. The restaurant became a family-owned corporation. Around 1976 the restaurant was becoming popular among many groups of people, including employees in Downtown Houston, area politicians, and other groups. Ninfa's became so popular that, in 1975, she opened a second location on Westheimer Road, one that was larger than the original. In 1977 Richard West of the Texas Monthly said \"no other Texas restaurant dictates the dining-out habits of so many of its city's inhabitants\" and that the restaurant is \"a favorite topic of conversation among Mexican food fanciers not just in Houston but all over the state.\" Around June 1977 the original Ninfa's on Navigation averaged 400 customers daily for lunch and 700 daily for dinner. During the same time the Ninfa's on Westheimer averaged 600 customers daily for lunch and 1,000 daily for dinner. The averages remained constant for all seven days of the week. In 1978 the restaurant chain had 500 employees, including 60 workers in the kitchens. Among the employees were members of Laurenzo's family. Laurenzo's five children, including four sons and one daughter, managed aspects of the Ninfa's business. Phyllis Mandola worked as the manager of the catering division. Jack Laurenzo, one son, and Ninfa Laurenzo held weekly cooking classes. Pilar Di Meo, Laurenzo's twin sister, worked in the restaurant's main office. Di Meo's son, Steve, worked as a personnel manager. Workers and municipal employees who had discovered restaurant chain took family members there. Throughout the restaurant's history, many celebrities, including Aerosmith, George H.W. Bush, George Benson, Dyan Cannon, Michael Douglas, Crystal Gayle, Rock Hudson, Reba McEntire, John Travolta, Ben Vereen, and ZZ Top ate at Ninfa's. Travolta had a private corner at the Westheimer Ninfa's location while he filmed Urban Cowboy, and while flying in his private aircraft he often stopped in Houston to pick up Ninfa's food. Bill Schadewald of the Houston Business Journal said that eating at Ninfa's became an integral routine of tourists in the Houston area."

Because of problems with the business, Ninfa's ultimately had to close three of the four new Dallas locations. At later points in the 1980s Ninfa's closed another Dallas location and a San Antonio location. Greg Hassel of the Houston Chronicle said that expanding Ninfa's \"has not always been easy.\" In the early 1980s there were nine Ninfa's. The profits from the original two restaurants were used to open the other seven. By 1983 Ninfa's became the largest Hispanic-owned business in Houston. In 1987 there were nine Ninfa's locations in Greater Houston. In September 1987 the chain celebrated its tenth anniversary of the Westheimer restaurant, with a weeklong schedule of festivities."

At the time opening a new restaurant would have a cost of $1.5 million. In October of that year McFaddin paid Ninfa's $635,000 for the rights of the future use of the Ninfa's name, and Roland Laurenzo and another Ninfa's executive joined McFaddin; these actions began the joint venture. Roland became the senior vice president of the McFaddin restaurant group. McFaddin was required to pay a quarterly fee to Ninfa's based on the restaurant chain's sales. As part of the agreement, McFaddin was to open 12 Ninfa's locations by April 25, 1989. After the opening of the tenth restaurant, it was supposed to continually operate ten of the restaurants for a five-year period. Less than nine months after the agreement was signed, Roland Laurenzo and six other McFaddin employees were terminated, and McFaddin sued Ninfa's and the Laurenzo family. In its suit, McFaddin said that Ninfa's and the Laurenzo family had threatened to picket the McFaddin restaurant and disrupt McFaddin restaurants, defamed McFaddin, and asked McFaddin employees to disrupt operations at the McFaddin restaurants. Ninfa's counter-sued McFaddin in the fall of 1986, saying that McFaddin changed the name of the Bandera division, an Austin, Texas-based home delivery Mexican food stores that opened and closed in 1986, in order to deprive Ninfa's of revenues. After civil action from both sides occurred, the parties agreed to a settlement."

The restaurants in Georgia and Louisiana were independent franchises. In 2005 Ninfa's continued to have locations in Texas, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Shreveport, Louisiana, and Georgia. In 2006, Niel Morgan, the owner of the Antone's po boy chain, started the new firm Legacy Restaurants, then proceeded to make a deal with Serrano's. Morgan acquired the rights to the original Ninfa's and took direct control, while Serrano's began to license the Ninfa's name for eight other locations. After Morgan took control of the original restaurants, he proceeded to begin renovations, which added potted plants and a colonial Spanish-style bench. As part of Morgan's overhaul, a VIP parking service was added. Morgan also had the restrooms upgraded and added an outdoor deck and a parking lot. The Original Ninfa's on Navigation has been owned and operated by Legacy Restaurants since mid-2006. The Executive Chef is Alex Padilla whose mother worked for Laurenzo when he was growing up in Houston. Legacy has made a number of improvements including a lighted parking lot and covered outdoor seating. There are still \"Ninfa's Mexican Restaurants\" in Houston and elsewhere operated by independent owners who previously received licenses to use the name from the Laurenzo family. None of these are affiliated with the Original Ninfa's on Navigation. In 2008, there were 14 independently licensed Ninfa's locations. In 2012, several licensed Ninfa's locations were converted into \"Maggie Rita's Tex-Mex Grill & Bar,\" a restaurant chain co-owned by Carlos Mencia. Katharine Shilcutt of the Houston Press rated the food at the new restaurants negatively and said that \"[i]t represents a new nadir for a once-respected and beloved Houston Tex-Mex institution.\" Shilcutt further added that the takeover caused an \"uproar\" in Houston and that \"but to many longtime Houstonians (me included), the deal with interloper Maggie Rita's may as well have been a pact with the devil.\" In 2012 Shilcutt said that overall, \"Ninfa's hadn't been that great in a long time\". She explained that the original location was \"still reflective of the restaurant chain when it was in its prime,\" while the other locations \"have varying levels of food and service, although most have fallen away significantly from the high-quality cuisine offered at the Original and last of the true Ninfa's empire.\" In November 2013 an enclosed patio opened at the original Ninfa's.

Ninfa Laurenzo drew inspiration from the cooking of her mother, who was a Mexican, and from Laurenzo's own travels to Mexico City. The food had an Italian influence because Laurenzo's deceased husband, Domenic Thomas Laurenzo, was an Italian American. Mozzarella, olive oil, and parmesan were used as ingredients. The signature dish was \"tacos al carbon,\" which later became called \"fajitas.\" The Ninfa's fajitas included chopped, char-grilled beef fillets placed in handmade flour tortillas. Ninfa's used a smoky marinade in the beef fajitas. The restaurant popularized fajitas in the Houston area. This dish was so influential that, by 2001, just about all Tex-Mex restaurants in Houston served a version of the Ninfa's fajitas. The second most popular dish was the \"Green Sauce,\" an avocado and tomatillo sauce. When a customer had asked for \"salsa verde,\" Ninfa Laurenzo created the \"Green Sauce\" at the spur of the moment. Ninfa Laurenzo's son Roland later offered a modified version of this dish at his own restaurant, using pureed avocados, tomatillos, cilantro, garlic, and jalape\u00f1os. Patricia Sharpe of Texas Monthly said that Roland's version was a \"creamier, more luxurious potion\" than his mother's original recipe. Ninfa's also offered stuffed jalape\u00f1os. The stuffed jalape\u00f1os became a menu item at Tony Mandola's Gulf Coast Kitchen, operated by Phyllis Laurenzo Mandola, one of Ninfa Laurenzo's daughters, and her husband Tony. In 2004 Sharpe said that, at the original Ninfa's, the beef fajitas \"still have their old magic\" and that the flour tortillas, still made to order in-house, \"are truly carb-addictive.\" She said that the chicken fajitas \"have lost their luster.\" After Neil Morgan took over the chain in 2006, chef Alex Padilla added some new menu items including crab cakes with poblano sauce and Spanish lobster in tequila butter sauce. Padilla also said that the restaurant would grind its own beef brisket for its crispy tacos and use fresh tomatillo in the green sauce. The original Ninfa's includes several torta sandwiches, including the fajita burger, which consistently is positively reviewed. By July 2012 the restaurant introduced three new tortas, Al Pastor, Chicken Adobo, and Puerca (Pork)."

Cano hired local Mexican cooks, such as Ignacio Segura who eventually became the VP of Operations during the 1980s, and asked them to cook genuine Mexican food, inspired by Texas vacations the Segura family would take in Houston. The original queso fundido recipe was Rosa-Maria Segura's recipe.  Ignacio's management career was followed by his best friend, who now owns a Mexican restaurant in Rancho Santa Margarita, Ca. Ignacio, or more affectionately known as \"Nacho\", is retired in Orange County, Ca. He also managed Acapulco restaurants and was previously GM of Ritz Carlton in Acapulco prior to his employment with El Torito. For a period of time, the financially strapped Cano was evicted from his home and lived in the restaurant. Within three years the restaurant became successful, and Cano opened additional locations. By 1976 he had 20 locations, and sold the business to W. R. Grace and Company for about $20 million. They hired Cano as the President with a directive for rapid expansion. Grace sold its restaurants in a leveraged buyout in 1986. The resulting firm, Restaurant Enterprises Group (REG), filed for bankruptcy in 1993. REG was acquired out of bankruptcy in 1994 by Foodmaker, who renamed itself Family Restaurants, then Koo Koo Roo Enterprises, then Prandium. In 2000, Acapulco bought El Torito from Prandium. Acapulco renamed its parent company to Real Mex Restaurants in 2004 and moved the headquarters to Cypress, California. On October 3, 2011, Real Mex Restaurants filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and announced that it was putting itself up for sale, citing the poor economy as a reason. No plans were announced to close restaurants or layoff staff. It was acquired by a group of its noteholders in a bankruptcy auction in 2012."

The recipe of the Hotel Sacher's version of the cake is a closely guarded secret.  Those privy to it claim that the secret to the Sacher Torte's desirability lies not in the ingredients of the cake itself, but rather those of the chocolate icing.  According to widely available information, the icing consists of three special types of chocolate, which are produced exclusively by different manufacturers for this sole purpose.  The hotel obtains these products from L\u00fcbeck in Germany and from Belgium. The Hotel Sacher has gone to great lengths to distinguish the Original Sacher Torte from other variations. This includes four golden corners on the wooden box, the wood engraving of the Hotel Sacher Wien as well as \"Das Original\" and \"Hotel Sacher Wien\" in writing in the inside of the lid, and bordeaux red wrapping paper with a Biedermeier motif."

He bought a small shop in Italian Harlem, once a very large Italian-American community, and ran the restaurant until his death in 1909. Louis Rao took over the business. He was seen by many as a very suave man. He had his hair cut at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and wore many fancy suits. Former co-owner Frank Pellegrino described those days as \"the days of big Cadillacs and usually convertibles.\" He was much more conservative in behavior and looks and refined the cuisine into a simpler Italian menu, with the help of \"Aunt Jake.\" After Vincent Rao's death in 1999, the restaurant was taken over by Frank Pellegrino, Anna Pellegrino Rao's nephew, and Ronald Straci, another close relative. Anna Pellegrino Rao refined the menu further with the help of Vincent and she is the source of much of the menu's identity today. On December 6, 2006, Rao's opened a second restaurant in Las Vegas, under executive chef Carla Pellegrino, with two ten-table rooms and additional seating available on an outdoor garden patio. In early 2009, Rao's in Las Vegas opened a bocce bar outside and began offering bocce lessons and cocktails there.  On July 25, 2013, Frank Pellegrino Jr. announced on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon that Rao's will open in Hollywood soon. It has since been opened. Rao's now sells products in gourmet markets and supermarkets.  Products include pasta, sauces, as well as olive oil. Though small, Italian Harlem culture is still kept alive by Rao's and the Giglio Society of East Harlem. Every year on the second weekend of August in honor of Back To School, the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and the \"Dancing of the Giglio\" is performed while thousands of visitors and onlookers celebrate the once largest Italian community in New York City. The New York Post describes the restaurant as \"one of the hardest places to get into in the city\". Notable patrons of the eatery have included John Gotti, Rudy Giuliani, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Matt Sullivan, Paul Vario, Anthony Salerno, Henry Hill, Steven Crea, Michael Rosenthal, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Anthony Scaramucci, Donald Trump, Bo Dietl and many New York members of La Cosa Nostra."

In the 1920s, the building was owned by John Lande who used it as a French steam laundry, which is the origin of the restaurant's name. In 1978, Don Schmitt, the mayor of Yountville, renovated the building into a restaurant. He and his wife Sally Schmitt owned the French Laundry for much of the 1980s and early 1990s. In 1994, Keller bought the restaurant. In 1999, Keller published The French Laundry Cookbook, which he considers his definitive book on cuisine. That year it won three International Association of Culinary Professionals (IACP) awards for Cookbook of the Year, Julia Child \"First Cookbook\" Award, and Design Award. In 2004, the restaurant installed a geothermal heating and air conditioning system. In July 2014, the Napa Valley restaurant celebrated its 20th anniversary with a six-hour feast for friends, locals, and luminaries and temporarily closed for renovations before the end of the year. In December 2014, while being temporarily closed for renovations, The French Laundry wine cellar was robbed of an estimated $500,000 of wine.  Most of the wine was subsequently recovered. On April 7, 2015, the restaurant reopened following demolition of a number of buildings on the site. During the remainder of the renovation project, the staff worked out of a temporary kitchen. During the COVID-19 pandemic, The French Laundry has opened and closed a few times. They are currently open with limited seating, in accordance with pandemic restrictions. In November 2020, Governor Gavin Newsom attended a private party at the restaurant. Newsom was photographed not socially distancing nor wearing a mask, despite having urged Californians to socially distance, not travel, and wear mask indoors and outdoors at all times. Newsom received widespread criticism as a result, and the party was believed to have caused a surge in support for the recall effort against him."

The thick liquid may be kept hot over a very low flame or in a pan of hot water, but should not be stirred as it will form grainy crystals. This liquid is then poured in a molten state upon clean snow, whereupon the cold causes it to rapidly thicken. If the syrup runs, rather than hardens, when it is poured on the snow, then it has not yet been boiled long enough to make the soft maple candy. Once sufficiently hardened, the candy can be picked up and eaten. The higher a temperature one boils the initial syrup, the thicker the final result will be. As it is popularly eaten soft, it is usually served fresh. It is most often prepared and eaten alongside the making of maple syrup at a sugar shack, or cabane \u00e0 sucre."

        "content": "Don Pablo's was an American chain of Tex-Mex restaurants founded in Lubbock, Texas, in 1985. The menu featured Tex-Mex items, made-from-scratch salsa, tortillas and sauces, and a range of other Mexican specialties. At one time, this chain had as many as 120 locations throughout the United States and was the second largest full-service Mexican restaurant chain within the United States during the late 1990s, second only to Chi-Chi's. The chain had 34 restaurants in 14 states when it was acquired in 2014 by Food Management Partners. By October 2016, the chain was reduced to 12 restaurants in 9 states, 6 restaurants in 4 states by July 2018, 5 restaurants in 3 states by September 2018, and later 3 restaurants in 3 states by November 2018. The remaining restaurants in the struggling chain gradually and quietly closed over the next seven months until the last restaurant in Deptford Township, New Jersey, finally closed on June 23, 2019."

        "content": "This chain of Tex-Mex restaurants was started by Texas-based DF&R Restaurants Inc. in 1985. After a period of rapid growth throughout the state of Texas, Don Pablo's began to build new locations in the Midwest. By 1995, DF&R had 51 Don Pablo's locations which made Madison, Georgia-based Apple South to notice the chain successful growth rate during the previous ten years of operation. This led to Apple South's purchase of DF&R in 1995. At the time of the purchase, Apple South was one of the largest franchise holders in the Applebee's restaurant system with 170 Applebee's restaurants, along with operating restaurants from other franchise chains, with most of the properties located in the South and Midwest. Two years later, Apple South decided to divest all of its 264 Applebee's franchises (in a franchise system that had 960 units), along with its other franchise properties, to focus its efforts on the 120-unit Don Pablo's and the other company-owned chains. Shortly after the Applebee's restaurant divesture, Apple South changed its name to Avado Brands to emphasise the change of business. Things did not go as well as Avado had originally planned, and it filed for bankruptcy in 2004. At that time, it had 106 Don Pablo's. Avado exited bankruptcy a year later with 96 Don Pablo's in operation. After spending two years trying to revitalize the brand, Avado filed for bankruptcy for the second time in September 2007 and subsequently closed or sold about half of its 90 locations. In February 2008, 41 Don Pablo's locations were acquired by Rita Restaurant Corporation of Madison, Georgia, a fully owned subsidiary of DDJ Capital Management of Waltham, Massachusetts. Rita tried to revitalize the brand by closing under-performing locations and selling franchises. A franchise was sold to a Florida-based operator who re-opened a Don Pablo's in Sarasota, Florida, in 2012. The Sarasota location was the sole remaining franchise until it was finally closed in 2015. In 2014, the 34-unit chain was acquired by San Antonio-based Food Management Partners (FMP). FMP is also a franchise operator of Buffalo Wild Wings and several Italian restaurant chains. While FMP owned the company, locations were closed in February 2014 at Atlanta, Georgia; in August 2014 at Hobart, Indiana; in February 2015 at Canton, Ohio; in April 2015 at Flint, Michigan; in February 2016 at Greenville, South Carolina and Maple Grove, Minnesota; in August 2016 at Richfield, Minnesota and Newport, Kentucky; and in September 2016 at Beavercreek, Ohio and Owings Mills, Maryland. On October 4, 2016, Rita Restaurant Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after nearly cutting the number of Don Pablo's locations in half. At the time of the bankruptcy announcement, all four Indianapolis-area locations along with locations in Battle Creek, Michigan and Toledo, Ohio were immediately closed with little advance warning. At the time of the bankruptcy filing, there were 12 restaurants remaining. By November 2016, the Alexandria, Virginia location quietly disappeared from the Don Pablo's website. The Eden Prairie, Minnesota location quietly disappeared from the Don Pablo's website sometime between February and July 2017. The contents of the Eden Prairie restaurant was auctioned off in March. The Shelby Charter Township, Michigan location disappeared from the Don Pablo's website sometime between July 8 and July 19. In February 2018, the Don Pablo's location in Lafayette, Indiana quietly closed to leave 8 remaining locations. In April 2018, the Grand Prairie, Texas location quietly closed its doors to leave the number of locations at 7 by May 2018. In July 2018, the Norwood, Ohio location closed its doors to leave a total number of 6 locations. At the time of the closing, the remaining locations were in the states of Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, and Texas. Two months later, the Christiana, Delaware restaurant was closed in September 2018 to leave just 5 restaurants in three states. In early November 2018, the Moorestown, New Jersey, restaurant closed for the final time and about the same time, the listing for the Fort Worth, Texas, restaurant disappeared from the Don Pablo's website to leave three locations in the states of Maryland, New Jersey, and Texas remaining in the failing chain. Just two and a half weeks later, the Baltimore location, the last location in Maryland, was closed just days before Thanksgiving while the last Don Pablo's restaurant in Texas also disappeared from the website, leaving Deptford Township, New Jersey as the last one in business. The Deptford location finally closed in June 2019."

        "content": "The company was founded in 1964 on West 56th Street in New York City by 25-year-old Hiroaki Aoki, the father of Steve Aoki and Devon Aoki. Aoki, a wrestler who had qualified for but did not attend the 1960 Summer Olympics, started the restaurant with  earned from driving an ice cream truck in Harlem.  The first restaurant, Benihana of Tokyo, was named for the red safflower that was the name for the coffee shop owned by his parents in Tokyo. Aoki's concept was for the meals to be theatrically prepared by a knife-wielding, joke-telling chef at a teppanyaki table surrounded by a wooden eating surface in front of the guests (Teppan meaning \"steel grill\" or \"griddle\" and yaki meaning \"grilled\" or \"broiled\").  It did not do well until early 1965, when Clementine Paddleford of the New York Herald Tribune gave it a rave review.  The Beatles and Muhammad Ali were among the celebrities who then descended on the four-table restaurant. Within a year Aoki opened a bigger restaurant that featured samurai armor, heavy wooden ceiling beams, and sliding sh\u014dji screens to provide some privacy. In 1968, it opened its first restaurant outside of New York City in Chicago. In 1976, Aoki brought in consultant Hardwicke Companies (its founder Charles H. Stein was the original developer of Six Flags Great Adventure as well as operated various New York restaurants including Tavern on the Green) as a partner to run the company. In 1980, Aoki terminated the relationship and settled a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission complaint of insider trading of Hardwicke stock. In 1982, Benihana National Corporation went public with Joel Schwartz as president. Some of the restaurants continued to be privately owned by Aoki. The company had some missteps including the opening of the upscale Big Splash restaurant and a frozen food division Benihana National Classics. Its stock dived and shareholders sued over management including the fact that Aoki still had his privately held restaurants of the same name. In 1995, the company acquired 17 restaurants from Benihana of Tokyo. The company has since expanded by purchasing the Haru and RA Sushi restaurants, which operate under those names. Haru is based in New York City; RA has locations across the country, and is based in Scottsdale, Arizona, with its original four locations scattered around the greater Phoenix area. Although Benihana owns these concepts, they are independently operated and were developed autonomously. It also acquired the Samurai and Kyoto restaurants which it has incorporated into its other brands. In 2004, the company issued a class of preferred stock to BFC Financial corporation to renovate its restaurants and expand. The stock diluted Aoki's control of the chain and the family sued, citing that Benihana had no compelling need for the cash, other forms of capital were available, and that the terms of the preferred stock issued to BFC were onerous. A  member of the board of directors was also a director of BFC, a company that held controlling interests in BankAtlantic, Blue Green, and Levitt Homes. However, the Delaware Court of Chancery upheld the decision. Benihana's famous figural \"tiki mugs\" for exotic cocktails, the most common of which depicts \"Hotei,\" a chubby buddha-like figure with arms raised in the air, have become collectible. Aoki died in 2008 at the age of 69. In 2009, Richard C. Stockinger became chief executive to replace Joel A. Schwartz, and in 2010 became president as Juan C. Garcia resigned. Benihana agreed in 2012 to be purchased by the private equity firm of Angelo Gordon & Company for $296 million. On February 5, 2014, the Board of Directors of Benihana Inc. named Steve Shlemon the company's new President and Chief Executive Officer. In 2016, Benihana Inc. named Thomas J. Baldwin CEO and president. Baldwin had been director of Benihana and served as an advisor to the operator's principal investor, Angelo, Gordon & Co."

Eventually, the entire board approved resolutions ratifying a stock purchase agreement with the buyer and authorizing the stock issuance. Afterwards, the company filed an action against almost all of Benihana, Inc.'s directors, alleging breaches of fiduciary duties. On January 30, 2011, Benihana (Kuwait) filed a defamation lawsuit against a blogger for writing about his experience on his website. Las Palmas, the company that owns Benihana in Kuwait, took legal action against the reviewer for his \"negative\" attitudes towards the restaurant and for recording the videos without permission. The company alleged that the blogger worked for an advertising company and might have personal motives that could be linked to his work to denigrate Benihana and praise its competitors located in the same area."

Antoine's itself is not pivotal to the plot, which hinges on the murder of a woman from a snobbish-but-impoverished old Creole family, just as she was beginning to face a serious chronic illness. Rather, Antoine's is part of the ambience of New Orleans, which Keyes depicts as an exotic, half-foreign city whose ways are not easily understood by outsiders, especially those from the North. The novel is notable for its use of the \"least likely person\" motif in revealing the identity of the murderer, and for a final plot twist that renders the murder and its aftermath even more tragic. Antoine's is mentioned in other novels by Keyes, including Once on Esplanade, Crescent Carnival, The River Road, and its sequel, Vail D'Alvery. Dinner at Antoine's was Keyes's best-selling and best-known book."

After its opening in 1970 at 1312 Spruce St. (Perrier was 23), Le Bec-Fin soon established a reputation as Philadelphia's finest restaurant, with Perrier's Galette de Crabe and Quenelles de Brochet as signature highlights.  By 1981, Le Bec-Fin was known as the leader of the \"Philadelphia restaurant revolution\". The restaurant moved to its final location at 1523 Walnut Street in 1983. Esquire described it as the best French restaurant in America and a 1994 Cond\u00e9 Nast reader's poll ranked it as the best restaurant in the country.'The Le Bec-Fin signature crab cake recipe can be found online, and is also featured in Georges Perrier's 1997 book, titled Le Bec-Fin Recipes. Perrier's cuisine favors traditional French ingredients with high-quality produce from throughout the world. The wine list favored selections from the borders of France and some standouts from the new world. Perrier made extensive changes to the restaurant after the Mobil Travel Guide reduced it to 4-star status in the 2001 Mobil Travel Guide.  The interior was remodeled, the wine list expanded, and Perrier relinquished command of his restaurant to the head chef.  Perrier said to his staff, \"Change everything but the chandeliers.\"  In the 2003 guide, the fifth star was restored. On April 4, 2008, Le Bec-Fin gave up its 5-star rating in favor of a more relaxed atmosphere. This loss dropped the number of American 5-star restaurants to 16. The change to a more relaxed atmosphere included \u00e0 la carte dining as opposed to a fixed price menu with a strict seating schedule. In January 2009, the French government awarded Perrier the Legion d'Honneur. Although he denied it at first, Georges Perrier put the building up for sale in 2010. During a dinner at the restaurant several months later, however, he announced that he would keep the restaurant open indefinitely. Prompted by an unfavorable review, Perrier announced his retirement in February 2012 and sold Le Bec-Fin to one of its former managers, Nicolas Fanucci, who re-opened the restaurant in June 2012 after remodeling and making minor adjustments. Master chef Walter Abrams, formerly of the restaurant French Laundry, led the kitchen, stressing locally-grown ingredients and fresh produce. Upon hearing of the restaurant's closure, filmmaker Erika Frankel began making a documentary on Perrier and his restaurant. Entitled King Georges'', the film premiered in April 2015 at a film festival. Le Bec-Fin closed after dinner service on June 15, 2013. The space then housed Chef Justin Bogle's progressive American restaurant Avance, which closed October 11, 2014 after 10 months."

        "content": "Quanjude was established in 1864 during the Qing dynasty under the reign of the Tongzhi Emperor. Although Peking duck can trace its history many centuries back, Quanjude's heritage of roast duck preparation \u2013 using open ovens and non-smoky hardwood fuel such as Chinese date, peach, or pear to add a subtle fruity flavor with a golden crisp to the skin \u2013 was originally reserved for the imperial families. The first Quanjude manager, Yang Renquan, who started out selling chicken and ducks, paid a retired chef from the palace for the imperial recipe. Soon after, Quanjude began to serve roast duck from the imperial kitchen to the common masses. Yang Renquan opened his first, small Dejuquan (\u5fb7\u805a\u5168, the three characters being reversed from the current name) inside Yangrou Hutong in Qianmen (\u524d\u9580), which at the time was one of the busiest areas in Beijing. His restaurant became an instant success and has since grown into the current branch in Qianmen that employs over 400 staff members and can occupy 900 guests at one time. The Qianmen restaurant, along with the many other Quanjude branches, together form one of the largest food enterprises in the nation. On 19 August 1966, Red Guards from 2nd, 25th and 63rd Middle Schools raided the restaurant, smashing the original antique restaurant sign and replacing with a modern one reading \"Beijing Roast Duck Restaurant\" as part of the Cultural Revolution's \"Smash the Four Olds\" campaign. The name was changed back to Quanjude on February 9, 1980."

The broth is made with beef sinew (instead of the dried skipjack flakes used in other types of oden) and seasoned with strong soy sauce. Because the simmering broth is only replenished rather than discarded, it takes on a very deep, brown-black color; but this process of adding new broth to old is what gives Shizuoka oden the distinctive flavor that many people find so delicious. Like other types of oden, Shizuoka oden is particularly suitable for consumption in the colder seasons because of the warming effect it has, much like hot soups and stews served in other countries with cold seasons. Hot (spicy) karashi mustard goes well with it."

German-born Peter Luger (1866\u20131941) was the owner, and nephew Carl was the chef. When Peter died in 1941, his son Frederick took over and the restaurant declined. In 1950, Frederick shut the restaurant and put it up for auction. Bernard and Lester Magrill, local auctioneers and frequent patrons, conducted the auction. Sol Forman, and Seymour Sloyer who owned a metal giftware factory across the street, bought it as partners for a \"whimsically low\" bid. According to Lester Magrill, the purchase price was $35,000, which included the building as well as the restaurant. According to one history, \"the neighborhood was declining, filling up with Hasidic Jews, whose kosher rules forbade the eating of Luger's hindquarters. Both Forman and Sloyer had been eating at Luger for twenty-five years, and they needed a place to take their clients. They were the only bidders during the auction. In 1968, Craig Claiborne of The New York Times gave a four star review of the steakhouse, under the new ownership. In 1968, Forman and Sloyer opened a Great Neck, New York, location. It was closed in 1984 after a severe fire, and reopened a year and a half later in 1986. Seymour Sloyer died in 2001 at the age of 85. Sol Forman died in 2001 at the age of 98. Ownership of the restaurant passed to Forman's daughters and Sloyer's wife and children In July 2009, while having dinner at Peter Luger, New York Governor David Paterson had Richard Ravitch secretly sworn in as Lieutenant Governor to oversee the stalemate-stricken State Senate."

While his partner, Milton Parker, mostly worked behind the scenes, Steiner worked the crowd with his Jewish humor in the restaurant, which became a destination for both celebrities and tourists in the theater district. Steiner was born in Newark, New Jersey. He worked in his parents' grocery store in nearby Elizabeth, New Jersey, where he grew up. The one-time owner of Pastrami & Things, a delicatessen located at Third Avenue and 23rd Street, he joined Milton Parker and Fred Klein in 1976, purchasing the Carnegie Deli from the trio of Bernie Gross, Max Hudas and Thomas North. Klein, who had not been actively involved in running the business, dropped out shortly thereafter. Under the management of Parker and Steiner, the deli became known nationwide, attracting celebrities such as Woody Allen, Jackie Mason and Henny Youngman, and opened branch locations in Atlantic City, New Jersey; Secaucus, New Jersey; and Tysons Corner, Virginia. Steiner became the public face of Jewish food, appearing in a television commercial for rye bread. He created a 60-pound Statue of Liberty carved from chopped liver, complete with a torch fashioned from a turkey wing, for the United States Bicentennial and was asked to prepare corned beef and pastrami for visiting heads of state attending the G7 economic summit meeting held in 1983 in Williamsburg, Virginia. Portions of Woody Allen's 1984 movie Broadway Danny Rose were filmed in the restaurant. Milton Parker, who died in 2009, had written a book (with Allyn Freeman) called How to Feed Friends and Influence People: The Carnegie Deli, providing the history of the family's ownership."

Veeraswamy & Co. in Hornsey in 1896 to promote Indian foods \"so that they could be used under Western conditions and yet produce Eastern results\". He sold them under the trademark \u2018Nizam\u2019 an Indian noble title meaning viceroy. In 1924 Palmer was engaged to advise the restaurant in the Indian Government Pavilion at the British Empire Exhibition in Wembley Park, Middlesex. Restaurants at the Exhibition were a monopoly of J. Lyons, but the Indian Government reserved the right to use Indian cooks.  They called in Palmer, \"of Messrs. Veeraswami [sic] & Co.\" to serve as \"Indian Adviser at the restaurant.\" This included providing some of the dishes served. In 1924 the restaurant in the Indian Pavilion advertised itself thus: \"If you appreciate Indian foods take your lunch at the Indian Pavilion.\" The official Indian Government report for the 1924 season says \"The Indian Restaurant with its curries drew large crowds, and at lunch and tea time on most days long queues formed up at the entrance.\" Of Palmer it says \"his selection [as adviser] was happy, and the success of the Indian cafe was largely due to him.  The Indian cafe was not only appreciated by Indian visitors to Wembley who were able to get their vegetarian food, but was very popular with the British public.\" In 1924 the restaurant served an average of 500 curries a day. For reasons both economic and political the Government of India did not participate in the Exhibition in 1925. The Indian Pavilion was turned into an 'oriental bazaar' selling goods from throughout India and Burma. However, the restaurant was retained, and this time was entirely run by Veeraswamy & Co. In 1925 the restaurant could seat 200 people. Veeraswamy in Regent Street was not the first Indian restaurant in Britain (one had been opened by Sake Dean Mahomed in 1810), or the only one in 1926, but it was probably the first high-end one, and one of the first to cater to a largely European (though initially admittedly mostly ex-Indian Civil Service and Indian Army) clientele. It was certainly the first to cater to European royalty. The restaurant was taken over by Sir William Steward in 1930. He was married to a singer and artist of the time Greta Gaye. Throughout the 1930s trade was very difficult but the couple used great resourcefulness and came through the challenging times. In 1915 Veeraswamy published a recipe book, Indian Cookery for Use in All Countries, which is still in print today. In the 1940s and 1950s the restaurant became a great success. The first ever curry in a can was introduced under Veeraswamy Food Products brand in the early 1950s. The restaurant was sold by Sir William in 1967. The food products business under the Veeraswamy name continued to be owned by the couple into the 1990s. The restaurant decor was updated a number of times, and adopted an ultramodern theme in the late 1990s; however, for its 80th anniversary in 2006, it was redecorated in a 1920s motif. Veeraswamy is currently owned by the Chutney Mary group. The origins of lager drinking with Indian food may be related to Prince Axel of Denmark's visit to the Veeraswamy-connected Indian restaurant at the British Empire Exhibition on 2 May 1924. He enjoyed his meal and later visited the Regent Street restaurant, apparently bringing a barrel of Carlsberg with him. He enjoyed his meal again, and decided to send a barrel of Carlsberg (the Danish royal beer) to the restaurant every year thereafter. The beer proved popular, so the restaurant started importing Carlsberg, and when waiters left to found or work in other Indian restaurants, they served Carlsberg as well. Notable diners at Veeraswamy have included Winston Churchill, King Gustav VI of Sweden, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Charlie Chaplin and Ian Sinclair. Sir Abdul Qadir dined at the restaurant in February 1939, when the menu consisted of Mulligatawny Soup, Kashmiri fish, Chicken Madras and suji halva. Veeraswamy was acquired by Ranjit Mathrani and Namitha Panjabi in 1997.  They restored the decor, creating opulent interiors evoking 1920s maharajal palaces. In 2016 Veeraswamy was awarded a Michelin star.  The Michelin Guide inspectors said that \"It may have opened in 1926 but this celebrated Indian restaurant just keeps getting better and better! The classic dishes from across the country are prepared with considerable care by a very professional kitchen. The room is awash with colour and it's run with great charm and enormous pride\"."

        "content": "A crostata is an Italian baked tart or pie, also known as coppi in Naples and sfogliata in Lombardy. The earliest known use of crostata in its modern sense can be traced to the cookbooks Libro de Arte Coquinaria (Book of the Art of Cooking) by Martino da Como, published circa 1465, and Cuoco napolitano (Neapolitan Cook), published in the late 15th century containing a recipe (number 94) titled Crostata de Caso, Pane, etc.. A crostata is a \"rustic free-form version of an open fruit tart\" that may also be baked in a pie plate. Historically, it also referred to an \"open-faced sandwich or canap\u00e9\" because of its crusted appearance, or a chewet, a type of meat pie."

The French term croustade derives from it, from which the English term custard derives. The word crostata appeared in the earliest Italian dictionaries, included in the 1612 dictionary Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca (compiled from 1591 to 1608) by the Accademia della Crusca and the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, and the 1617 dictionary Il memoriale della lingua italiana: ridotto in ordine d'alfabeto per commodit\u00e0 del lettore by Giacomo Pergamino, in which it was defined as a type of torta."

        "content": "Traditionally, a crostata consisted of a base, usually three layers, of friable dough \"flavoured with clarified fat and butter\". Today, shortcrust pastry is used instead. It is differentiated from a torta by its filling: a crostata has an inconsistent chunky filling, whereas a torta has a consistent filling made of blended ingredients. There are \"endless variations\" of both sweet and savoury crostata, the sweet ones usually being served as a dessert. Sweet variations use fruit preserves as a filling, typically apricot, cherry, peach or nectarine, or berries. The crostata can also be blind-baked and then filled with pastry cream (crema pasticciera) topped with pieces of fresh fruit; this is called crostata di frutta.  In his 1570 cookbook Opera dell'arte del cucinare, Bartolomeo Scappi included a recipe for a crostata of plums and sour cherries, and others for quince, and pears. A modern version is crostata alla nutella, which has Nutella as the filling. Ingredients for a savoury crostata may include meat, fish, or vegetables, which are pre-cooked. Opera dell'arte del cucinare included a recipe for a \"crostata of crabmeat and shrimp\", and also stated that to instead make a torta, the shrimp and crab should be crushed. A popular sweet variant, especially in central Italy, is crostata di ricotta, made with ricotta mixed with sugar and lemon zest, and which may additionally include cocoa or raisins. Scappi included many recipes for crostata in Opera dell'arte del cucinare. For meat and seafood based crostata, there were recipes using pork jowls or prosciutto, crayfish, anchovies, or oysters. Other savoury crostata recipes included a crostata with creamy cheese referred to as a butirata, those with truffles or field mushrooms, one with artichoke or cardoon hearts, and one with \"the viscera of any sort of turtle\"."

An opening on the top was used to add broth immediately before eating which made it a hot meal. This made cooking in the field fast and easy. For most of the Soviet period, much of the Tatar cuisine including uchpuchmaks was removed from public catering due to clumsy overregulation. In the late 60s, Yunus Ahmetjanov, a legendary chef pushed for recognition of uchpuchmak, chakchak and other Tatar meals on the unionwide level and was successful in promoting them to public catering menus all across the Soviet Union. Presently, uchpuchmaks are often made without an opening, however, it's still served with meat broth in a separate bowl.

The restaurant Savoy at the top floor of one of the buildings around the Esplanadi in central Helsinki is famous for its vorschmack.

        "content": "Khorovats can be made with lamb (gar), pork (khoz), beef (tavar), chicken (hav), or less commonly veal (hort). Some type of vegetable is usually served with the meat. A common preparation for green vegetables like asparagus or green beans is to fry them and combine with whipped eggs, a dish which resembles scrambled eggs with vegetables. A typical khorovats is made of chunks of meat grilled on a shampoor (\u0577\u0561\u0574\u0583\u0578\u0582\u0580) or skewer, although steaks or chops grilled without skewers may be also used. 2006 book Armenian Food: Fact, Fiction & Folklore gives three tips for making good khorovats: The distance between the fire and the skewers should be approximately 12 to 15 centimeters (about 6 inches) The largest pieces of meat should always go in the middle, where there is more heat for the fire Shampoors (skewers) should be placed close together to concentrate the heat from the cooking fire In Armenia itself, khorovats is often made with the bone still in the meat (as lamb or pork chops). Proshian Street in Yerevan is dubbed \"Barbecue Street\" by foreigners, because many khorovats restaurants are located on the street."

        "content": "Brennan's was founded in 1946 by Owen Brennan, an Irish-American restaurateur and New Orleans native. It was originally called the Vieux Carr\u00e9 restaurant and was located on Bourbon Street across from the Old Absinthe House until 1956 when it moved to its current location. This building, a two-story French Quarter mansion at 417 Royal Street constructed in 1795, was built for Don Jos\u00e9 Faurie and later housed the Banque de la Louisiane, the first bank in Louisiana. From 1841 to 1891, the mansion had been owned by the Morphy family, with Paul Morphy, the celebrated chess player and unofficial world chess champion, living there until his death in 1884. In 1920 William Ratcliffe Irby gave the building to Tulane University  and it was initially leased by Owen Brennan in 1954 to open the following year as Brennan's. The restaurant purchased the building in 1984. Because Brennan's father owned a share of the restaurant, the restaurant was eventually inherited by Brennan's siblings as well as his children. In 1973, disagreement within the Brennan family over the expansion of the restaurant line led to a split into several different corporations, with the original New Orleans restaurant being wholly owned by Brennan's widow and children, and other restaurants in New Orleans, Houston, and Dallas, the Brennan Family Restaurants, being owned by Brennan's siblings and their children. Although the section of Royal Street in the French Quarter was spared the flooding suffered by most of the city in the levee failures during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Brennan's did suffer significant damage, largely due to the contents of second-story refrigerators melting and seeping onto lower floors. The restaurant's extensive wine cellar lost temperature control, ruining the entire wine collection. Following an extensive renovation, Brennan's re-opened on June 8, 2006. Brennan's closed on June 28, 2013. The new owners of Brennan's, Terry White and Ralph Brennan (a cousin of the former owners) purchased the building and the business at auction(s) after the former owners ran into financial trouble.  For more than a year, the historic building (circa 1795) underwent an extensive renovation. The new Brennan's was unveiled in the fall of 2014."

Blanc was listed as running the restaurant. By 1879, Boston city records listed Luis Ober as the proprietor of a restaurant at 2 Winter Place of \"over twenty years' standing\".  From the start, the restaurant specialized in French food and was central to the financial, political, and intellectual history of Boston. Louis Ober was born in 1837 in the French department of Alsace. At age fourteen Ober moved to New York, working as a barber, book seller and importing and exporting goods between the United States and France. Ober lived and worked in New Jersey, Cincinnati, and Philadelphia, before settling in Boston. Ober was employed at the restaurant then owned and operated by Blanc. While in Blanc's employ, Ober became familiar with French food, fine wine and furnishings. By 1875, Ober had acquired ownership and applied to the city for expansion of the restaurant to 3-4 Winter Place. Financing was provided by Eben Jordan, a co-founder of the Jordan Marsh Company. The restaurant reopened as Ober's Restaurant Parisien. Over the next 20 years the restaurant was expanded and became furnished with increasingly luxurious imported materials typical of the Gilded Age, including Honduran mahogany, French furniture, Italian and French sculpture and paintings, English silver and Bohemian crystal lighting. Until 1970 the restaurant was open to males only. By the late twentieth century, Locke-Ober - though still possessing most of its original grand trappings - had lost much of its popularity. Boston restaurateur Lydia Shire, with investor Paul Licari, leased the space in 2001 and began a painstaking restoration of the main and private dining rooms on the third floor, adding two more contemporary rooms.  Jacky Robert was executive chef until 2003.  Nonetheless, the restaurant closed in 2012, with reports that the owners planned to sell the building. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. The location is now occupied by Yvonne's. The restaurant was the setting of the opening scene in Robert B. Parker's 1980 Spenser novel Looking for Rachel Wallace. It was also the setting of the denouement of Death in a Tenured Position (also published as A Death in the Faculty) by Amanda Cross published in 1981. The detective, Kate Fansler, is taken there by the lawyer, John Cunningham, at which she presents to him her solution to the mystery. Cunningham claims Fansler only likes the restaurant because it used not to admit women; she denies this, saying she is attracted by the creamed spinach and the waiters who tended to be 'deaf and placating'. It was also the restaurant that Professor Lambeau took Robin Williams' character, Sean, to in an attempt to convince him to work with the main protagonist in Good Will Hunting."

Others think the term was borrowed from other languages because of the large use of similar foods throughout the Eastern Roman Empire. The term \"Piada\" was officialized by Giovanni Pascoli, who adapted the Romagnol word \"pi\u00e8\" into its more Italian form.  Romagna was heavily influenced by Byzantium during the early Middle Ages when the Eastern Empire reconquered parts of the Western domain which had fallen to the invading barbarians. In those days Ravenna was the capital city of the Exarchate, and that would explain how the Greco-Byzantine recipe entered the local gastronomy. The first written evidence of Piadina as it is now recognized dates back to 1371, in the Descriptio Romandiolae compiled by Cardinal Anglico, who for the first time gave the recipe of the bread of the people of Romagna; \"It is made with wheat flour moistened with water and flavoured with salt. It is then kneaded with milk as well, and also a little lard.\""

Roubian, a carpenter by trade, had helped remodel the market three years earlier and had an interest in fishing. The original  restaurant was adjoined by a  annex. In 1992, a second restaurant was opened in Tustin, California. Bob Roubian, who was born in Pasadena, served as a Seabee during the Second World War. In 1955, Roubian and Cliffie Stone wrote a rockabilly song called \"The Popcorn Song\", proceeds from which helped pay off the restaurant's debts. Roubian died in 2017 and the restaurants are now managed by his son-in-law."

Founded by Antonio Veniero of Sorrento, the bakery was opened as a pool emporium and caff\u00e9 where Veniero served his baked products to customers.  The demand for his pastries and cakes won him awards in Rome, Bologna and the New York World's Fair.  The bakery has been continuously owned and operated by the Veniero family since its founding. In 1984 the family added an adjoining warm enclave, with a ceiling of stained-glass panels and the original pressed tin. Frank Zerilli changed the oven from coal to gas by the 1980s as well, and more recently Veniero's began selling carb-free cheesecakes and sugar-free cookies. Veniero's is famous for its traditional and regional Italian confections, including handmade Italian butter cookies, biscotti, cannoli, sfogliatelle, tiramis\u00f9, and its New York staple cheesecake. Veniero's was featured in the first New York City episode of Food Network's Road Tasted  and has been featured on many other shows, including ABC's Good Morning America and Live with Regis and Kelly, and Steve Schirripa's Hungry on the cable channel Mag Rack.  The bakery has also been the location for scenes on NBC's Law & Order.  It was also featured on HBO's Curb Your Enthusiasm season 8, episode 76, in a comedic plot where the main character uses the bakery's hard crust Italian bread as an improvised weapon. In 2010, Veniero's was named the winner for the Best Desserts in New York City by AOL's City's Best website.  Furthermore, some food tour companies visit Veniero's as part of their programs."

The restaurant was noted for being a place where whites and blacks were welcome, as were homosexuals. It was one of the first to seat black and white customers at the same tables, in an era when segregated seating was the norm.  Although Paschal's had \"colored only\" business and liquor licenses, the brothers openly disregarded the law and served white and black clientele alike. The restaurant was the unofficial headquarters for the Civil Rights Movement during the 1960s. Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders frequently convened here for strategy sessions, planning their protest marches, sit-ins, and voter registration drives. Notable patrons included Andrew Young, John Lewis, Julian Bond, Adam Clayton Powell Jr., Stokely Carmichael, Fannie Lou Hamer, Reverends Joseph Lowery and Jesse L. Jackson, Maynard H. Jackson, and Ralph Abernathy. Activists decompressed at Paschal\u2019s after \"arrests, death threats and beatings\", according to Lewis. The Paschal brothers kept the restaurant open all night as a safe haven for black activists returning from jail and as a meeting point for their families. They also posted bond and served free meals for activists. Strategy meetings also took place in the restaurant among white politicians, including Ted Kennedy, Hubert Humphrey, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton."

The $2 million motel \u2013 the first African-American owned and operated motel in the city \u2013 had banquet space for 350, another 160-seat dining room, and a swimming pool. Upon the motel's opening, Room 101 was permanently set aside for Martin Luther King's use. During his 1968 presidential campaign, Robert F. Kennedy maintained an office in the motel and also slept there. Jesse Jackson initiated the planning sessions for his 1984 presidential campaign at the motel. A 1975 article reported that the motel had 92 percent occupancy most of the year. The restaurant, lounge, and motel were closed in 1996. The property was sold for $3 million to Clark Atlanta University, which converted the motel into a student dormitory and conference centre named The Paschal Center. The restaurant's recipes were included in the sale, and Robert's fried chicken continued to be served in the restaurant to students and the public. The university closed the restaurant in 2003 and planned to demolish it, but public outcry led to a $100,000 congressional grant to save the historic structure. In 2004 plans were announced to open a Busy Bee Caf\u00e9 at Historic Paschal's."

Yeoh was keen to show that Asian food has just as much standing in the fine-dining circuit as other cuisines. The head chef is Alex Chow, also a Malaysian, whilst Yeoh continues to be the proprietor to this day. In 2009, Kai Mayfair was awarded a Michelin Star, making it the only Chinese restaurant added to the 2009 Michelin List in the UK. It was also the first Chinese restaurant in London to be awarded a Michelin star, which the restaurant has retained ever since. Among its other awards include the Harden's Guide's award for Best Chinese Restaurant in London (2009 Edition) and the Zagat Survey's Best Chinese Restaurant in London for two years from 2003 - 2005. The restaurant also received nominations for Restaurant magazine's UK Best Dishes as well as Tatler magazine's Best Kitchen Awards in 2006. The cuisine style has been described as 'Modern Chinese', which \"mixes tradition with innovation\", with the restaurant serving 'Liberated' Chinese cooking from the Nanyang region. The menu includes traditional, familiar dishes like prawn toast and sweet & sour pork but there are also many unfamiliar dishes like Nanyang chilli lobster and spring chicken & Szechuan spicy crumble, which is where the restaurant's \"true culinary personality can be found\", according to Yeoh's message at the start of the menu. The restaurant also offers an afternoon tea, available from 15:00 - 16:30 pm Wednesday to Sunday. Kai Mayfair was dubbed \"home of the world's most expensive soup\" when it unveiled its \u00a3108 version of Buddha Jumps Over the Wall in 2005. The dish includes shark's fin, Japanese flower mushroom, sea cucumber, dried scallops, chicken, Hunan ham, pork, and ginseng."

The building is a former whisky bond on the waterfront in the Leith area of Edinburgh. The imprint of Kitchin's work with Alain Ducasse and Pierre Koffmann is noticeable in the style of food served, and the restaurant has received support from other chefs that Kitchin has worked with; including opening with the cutlery and plates formerly used at the three-Michelin-starred restaurant La Tante Claire, operated by Koffman. The interior of the restaurant is decorated with dark woods and shades of grey by design company Cubit Design, and wallpapers by Jocelyn Warner. A window opens from the dining room onto the kitchen area itself, and it has a conservatory-style bar serving snacks and light meals. The food merges seasonal Scottish produce with French styles and techniques; the restaurant has the mantra \"from nature to plate\". While chef Tom Kitchin was away filming The Great British Menu for the BBC in March 2008, Pierre Koffman came out of retirement to stand in as head chef. Within six months of opening, The Kitchin was awarded a Michelin star. In 2009 the restaurant was voted as the second-best restaurant in Britain by Eat Out Magazine, and the best restaurant in the UK by Observer Food Monthly in 2010. The team behind The Kitchin opened a second restaurant, Castle Terrace, in July 2010. In June 2021, former workers of the Kitchin made allegations of bullying, violence and sexual assault in his restaurants. One alleged a chef burned a woman's arm with a hot tray from an oven, while another claimed staff were repeatedly punched if they were not fast enough. On 3 July, Tom Kitchin suspended two members of staff following these allegations. Kitchin Group said the claims would be \"fully and independently\" investigated."

In Kyrgyzstan it is an ingredient in a noodle dish called ashlan fu. Liangfen is generally white or off-white in color, translucent, and thick. It is usually made from mung bean starch, but may also be made from pea or potato starch. In western China, the jelly-like seeds of Plantago major were formerly also used. The starch is boiled with water and the resulting sheets are then cut into thick strips. Liangfen is generally served cold. The liangfen strips are tossed with seasonings including soy sauce, vinegar, sesame paste, crushed garlic, julienned carrot, and chili oil. In Lanzhou it is often served stir fried. In Sichuan, a spicy dish called Chuanbei Liangfen is particularly popular (see photo above). Similar foods include the Korean muk made with buckwheat, mung bean, or chestnut starch and Japanese tokoroten. Jidou liangfen, a similar dish from the Yunnan province of southwest China, is made from chick peas rather than mung beans. It is similar to Burmese tofu salad.

From 1986 to 2000, under the ownership of Lou Moench, Father's Office was influential in the rise of America's craft brewing industry and the establishment of smoke-free bars in California. Moench initially sold two types of beers from Anchor Brewing Company and Sierra Nevada Brewing Company, and expanded the beer menu over the years to include more than 70 brands from California, Oregon and Washington. Selections would vary, depending on available stock and season. Looking back on when he purchased Father's Office in the late '80s, Moench said embracing craft beer came with a cost. \"When I stopped selling Bud and put Widmer Hefeweizen on that tap handle, I got a reaction. I had to educate people.\" Father's Office made headlines in 1991 when Moench decided to voluntarily make it California's first smoke-free bar. For Moench, taking action was a health issue for his employees. \"Secondhand smoke kills some 53,000 people each year,\u201d Moench would tell bar owners. \"This is about caring for the health of your employees and customers who don't smoke,\" he said. Seven years later, all other bar owners in California would eventually join him. In 1994, Gov. Pete Wilson signed a law banning smoking in the workplace. A temporary exemption was carved out for bars and casinos, but that ended on January 1, 1998. Father's Office was purchased in 2000 by owner and head chef Sang Yoon, who had cooked gourmet California cuisine at Michael's restaurant in Santa Monica, California when he surrendered to the desire for his own establishment. He took over Father's Office and added his own touches. Yoon opened the bar's kitchen which had previously offered cheese plates and a list of local delivery options for patrons to bring in. The main attraction turned out to be the Office Burger, a patty of fine dry-aged beef topped with caramelized onions, Gruy\u00e8re and Maytag cheeses, applewood-smoked bacon compote and arugula served on a soft roll. Sang Yoon is infamous for allowing no substitutions or alterations of any type to the food served at Father's Office, including no ketchup. A second Father's Office location in the Helms Bakery building in Los Angeles, California was opened in April 2008."

        "content": "The restaurant was originally opened by Chris Bianco in 1987 in a grocery store which is now AJ's Euro-Market & Deli located in central Phoenix. He moved locations once before Pizzeria Bianco found its home in downtown's Heritage Square in 1996. Bianco was born in the Bronx, and grew up in Ossining, New York.  He had asthma as a child, forcing him to stay inside, where he watched his aunt cook. At age 13 he began working at a local pizzeria. In 1985 he won two plane tickets anywhere in the United States and, on a whim, chose to go to Phoenix.  When he got there, he felt connected to the place, and stayed.  He began making mozzarella in his apartment and selling it to Italian restaurants.  Later, Guy Coscos, a specialty grocer in Phoenix offered him the opportunity to make and sell pizzas in the corner of his store.  Bianco's pizza was popular and he realized he could make pizza for a living.  He went to Italy in 1993 to improve his pizzamaking.  In 1994, he returned to open Pizzeria Bianco at Town & Country Shopping Center in Phoenix.  In 1996, the restaurant moved to 623 East Adams Street, the historic site of Baird Machine Shop in Heritage Square.  Bianco also operates Bar Bianco, located next door to the pizzeria in Heritage Square, and Pane Bianco, located in Midtown Phoenix. Bianco cites Alice Waters, Suzanne Goin at Lucques, Mark Ladner at Del Posto, and Mario Batali as chefs who have inspired him."

In the end great pizza, like anything else, is all about balance. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d The menu is short, generally consisting of two appetizers, three salads, and six pizzas.  Pizzeria Bianco uses a wood-burning oven.  Since opening, Chris Bianco has made nearly every pizza himself, sometimes making 250 a night.  He and his staff make the mozzarella fresh each morning.  Bianco's dough is made by hand, and ideally he lets it ferment for 18 hours. The herbs are from a garden beside the restaurant. The vegetables are from the local farmer's market.  In January 2010, Bianco announced that he was taking some time away from pizza making for health reasons (the wood oven and flour in the air was aggravating his asthma).  However, Chris Bianco's brother Marco will continue to make the dough and for the time being Horacio Hernandez, Bianco's assistant for 15 years, will cook the pizzas."

After an initial struggle to open, Fetokakis received assistance from Pete Pappas of the Pappas Restaurants franchise. Eventually, Fetokakis' son Dimitri became owner of the restaurant. Dimitri considered Pappas a lifelong mentor, and was saddened by his death in 2005. In 2005, owner Dimitri Fetokakis began landscaping the median across from the restaurant as part of a commitment to Montrose Boulevard Conservancy's \"beautification\" project. Before the Houston recycling program known as RecycleBank went into effect in 2009, Niko Niko's used polystyrene plates, bowls, and cups to serve food and drinks. Since the program's implementation,  Fetokakis made the decision to switch to environmentally friendlier (though also more expensive) \"enviroware\" plates and degradable plastic bags. Houston residents participating in the incentive program can earn points for recycling and redeem them at the restaurant. After more than 30 years of doing business from its location in Neartown, Niko Niko's expanded in 2010 by adding a kiosk in Market Square Park in Downtown Houston. The  \"sidewalk cafe-style operation\" focuses on \"to-go\" foods such as gyro sandwiches, shish kababs and hummus. Niko Niko's has sponsored World Gyro Eating Championships at the annual Festival of Greece. In 2009, the restaurant hosted a viewing party after being featured on the Food Network's television program Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.

The current Jake's Restaurant and its predecessor establishments date back to 1892, establishing it as Portland's second oldest continuously operating restaurant. The original restaurant was called Mueller and Meier, a saloon established in 1892 at 18th and Washington Streets. This restaurant was one of two crawfish houses in Portland at the turn of the century. Mueller and Meier moved to the Whitney & Gray Building in 1911, where it operated as a saloon until 1913, when it became Mueller and Meier Cafe. In 1916 statewide prohibition took effect in Oregon and the restaurant began a soft drink service, a focus that continued throughout Prohibition. In 1920, Mueller and Meier sold their interests to Jacob J. Freiman and J. Rometsch. Jake Freiman, the original \"Jake\", had been a waiter at the Quelle Restaurant, a crawfish house established by Fritz Sichtem and Baron Schlenk in 1893. Freiman, a popular waiter and local character, brought with him the crawfish expertise, a large customer following, and popularity which established the reputation that has continued to the current day. In 1921, or 1922, Rometsch left or was bought out by Clem Hackman, and the latter association continued until 1933 when Jake died. The operation was then sold to Joseph Kaffesieder. Joe Kaffesieder, an outgoing personality himself, maintained the traditions and character of the restaurant and, in fact, also was known to many patrons as \"Jake\". The restaurant was later operated by Max Kaffesieder, Joe's son. Walter E. Holman, Sr., acquired the restaurant in 1946 and operated it until 1958, when he sold the establishment to his son Walter, Jr., who operated in until 1960. It was then sold to three investors, Orton Hall, a dentist, Glen Westfall, a contractor, and a third party. In 1961, Howard Wilson, a former manager under Walter Holman, acquired the facility with partner Nick Shewczyk. The current owner, William McCormick, acquired the restaurant in 1971. In 1972, William \"Bill\" McCormick purchased Jake's Famous Crawfish and hired Doug Schmick as his manager. Several years later, the pair formed a partnership that would later become the restaurant chain McCormick & Schmick's. The building that has housed the restaurant since 1911 was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1983, as the Whitney & Gray Building and Jake's Famous Crawfish Restaurant."

They opened Mosca's in Avondale, a remote area on the West Bank of the Mississippi River, in a building owned by New Orleans crime family boss Carlos Marcello, who became a regular customer of the restaurant. Marcello's son still owns the restaurant building.  (It is also sometimes reported that Provino Mosca had been a chef for Al Capone in Chicago, but the family says this is untrue.) Provino died in 1962.  Lisa (by then known as \"Mama Mosca\"), two of their children, Johnny and Mary, and Mary's husband Vincent took over the restaurant.  \"Mama Mosca\" died in 1979 and Vincent died in 2004. The restaurant was damaged in Hurricane Katrina but reopened in 2006, repaired and with a larger, air-conditioned kitchen, but otherwise mostly unchanged.  Johnny mostly retired after the hurricane, but Johnny's wife Mary Jo Angelotti, who took over as chef after Mary retired, continues to operate the restaurant  with other family members, including Johnny (until his death in 2011) and Mary Jo's daughter Lisa. Mosca's received an America's Classics award from the James Beard Foundation in 1999. During the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, Mosca's implemented a \"takeout only\" format, which inspired customers to find new ways to support the restaurant. One real estate guru was known to order Oysters Mosca \"by the carload\"; another couple arrived in an RV and proceeded to eat their takeout meal in the gravel parking lot, \"a home-style meal in their own mobile home away from home.\" Eventually, Mosca's resumed normal dining room service."

Writing in the 1970s, pioneer New Orleans food writers Richard and Rima Collin described the restaurant as \"a white shack on the left in almost total isolation\" and rated it as one of New Orleans' \"Best of the Best\", calling it \"a joyous place with no airs whatsoever, bubbling over with the noise of serious eating on a massive scale\" and a \"New Orleans institution\".  They described the food's heritage as deriving from \"the middle of Italy, the Romagna-Lazio region, rich in seafood.\"  (According to the restaurant's website, Provino Mosca came from San Benedetto del Tronto, a coastal city on the Adriatic Sea in the Marche region of central Italy.) In her New Orleans food memoir Gumbo Tales, Sara Roahen says, \"Mosca's is just the sort of family-run restaurant that New Orleanians tend to covet: it's creaky, set in its ways, and no picnic to find.\" In an edition of Roadfood written after Hurricane Katrina, Jane and Michael Stern comment that the restaurant seems unchanged since its reopening.  They ask the rhetorical question, \"can this two-room joint with the blaring jukebox really be the most famous Creole roadhouse in America?\"; then they describe the experience as a \"culinary epiphany\", and say that \"roadside food gets no better, or more garlicky, or heartier, than this.\" Calvin Trillin, in a November 2010 article about the restaurant in The New Yorker, also remarks on its seemingly unchanged nature since 1946. He recounts that the Mosca family had once considered moving the restaurant to a more convenient location, but the idea had met substantial resistance from their mostly local customer base. Reviews of the restaurant often note that almost every party orders more or less the same items from Mosca's relatively short menu, served family-style in very large portions.  These popular dishes include: Oysters Mosca (also called Oysters Italian Style), which the Sterns call \"a festival of garlic, olive oil, Parmesan cheese, and bread crumbs\"). Shrimp Mosca (also called Shrimp Italian Style), summarized by local food critic Tom Fitzmorris as \"enormous, whole, unpeeled, with olive oil and tons of garlic\". Marinated crab, served as a salad or in the shell. Chicken a la Grande, a simple dish cooked in a skillet with (in Trillin's words) \"only salt and pepper, rosemary, oregano, white wine, and, of course, ten cloves (or is it heads?) of garlic\". Spaghetti bordelaise, described by the Collins as \"perfect homemade pasta and a remarkable, perfectly balanced oil and garlic sauce\", and which Roahen calls \"as much butter, oil, and garlic as your body can process without suffering a systematic failure.\" Pineapple fluff for dessert, which the Collins called \"a bit of delicious New Orleans kitsch.\""

The first documented Chinese restaurant opened in 1849 as the Canton Restaurant. By 1850, there were five restaurants in San Francisco. Soon after, significant amounts of food were being imported from China to America's west coast. The trend spread eastward with the growth of the American railways, particularly to New York City. At the ratification of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 there were only 14 restaurants in San Francisco. However, the Chinese Exclusion Act allowed merchants to enter the country, and in 1915 restaurant owners became eligible for merchant visas. This fueled the opening of Chinese restaurants as an immigration vehicle. The Chinese Exclusion Act forced Chinese immigrants to move away from wage work to self employment through laundries and restaurants., the United States had 46,700 Chinese restaurants. There has been a consequential component of Chinese emigration of illegal origin, most notably Fuzhou people from Fujian Province and Wenzhounese from Zhejiang Province in Mainland China, specifically destined to work in Chinese restaurants in New York City, beginning in the 1980s. Adapting Chinese cooking techniques to local produce and tastes has led to the development of American Chinese cuisine. Many of the Chinese restaurant menus in the U.S. are printed in Chinatown, Manhattan."

        "content": "In the early 1880s, Chinese food items and eating houses appeared in London and Liverpool, mainly visited by Chinese seamen and students. In 1884, Chinese food was made available as part of an exhibition featuring a 'restaurant' in the International Health Exhibition in South Kensington, London. In 1907 or 1908, the first recorded Chinese restaurant was opened in London. The rise in the number of Chinese restaurants in the UK only began after the Second World War, and has been attributed to returning service personnel from Hong Kong. The restaurants were operated by Hong Kongers who moved to the UK. One restaurant that stands out in the history of Chinese restaurants in the UK is the Kuo Yuan which in 1963 was the first restaurant to serve Peking duck. In 2003, the first British Chinese restaurant achieved a Michelin star. In the United Kingdom, the business employed a large percentage of Chinese immigrants in the 1980s (90% in 1985). Opening a restaurant or takeaway gave a relatively low capital cost entry for Chinese families into self-employment. Many takeaways served a pseudo-Chinese cuisine based around western tastes, and the limited cooking skills and experience of the shop owners. In 2011, the Ming-Ai (London) Institute launched the British Chinese Food Culture project with a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, aimed at exploring and tracking the changes in Chinese food throughout its history in the United Kingdom. The 2020 coronavirus pandemic has negatively impacted many Chinese restaurants in the UK, with a number of restaurants in London's Chinatown in particular facing financial difficulty, due to lockdown restrictions and social distancing as well as prejudice against Chinese takeaways which the BBC describe as \"unfounded\"."

They emerged as commercial enterprises on the Victorian gold fields. The significant majority of original Chinese migration came from Kwangtung Province in southern China, heavily influencing the style of food, consisting of fresh vegetables and fruit, with fish, poultry, and pork, with rice, herbs and spices. One third of all cooks in Australia were Chinese by 1890."

Chinese food in the Netherlands is often inspired by Indonesian cuisine owing to the Netherlands' colonisation of Indonesia. In 2019, it was reported that the previous decade had seen a 22% decline in the number of Chinese-Indonesian restaurants in the Netherlands, whereas the number of other restaurants increased by 15%. Researchers attributed this to Chinese restaurants not meeting \"modern\" desires of consumers, including outdated d\u00e9cor and fatty food considered unappealing to an increasingly health-conscious population. In 2020, a number of Chinese restaurants began trialling the use of service robots, including in Renesse and Maastricht. A study published in 2019 raised concerns regarding labour trafficking in Chinese restaurants in the country, due to the migrants' \"vulnerability to exploitation\" and urged protection for migrants against \"extreme forms of labour exploitation\" seen across Europe."

Peter later opened additional Canlis restaurants in Honolulu (1954), Portland (1959), and San Francisco (1965).

Prior to opening Comet Ping Pong, Alefantis and Greenwood co-owned Buck's Fishing and Camping, another restaurant next door to Comet's current location. The location of Comet was previously occupied by another restaurant, Thai Room. When it was announced that it was closing, Alefantis decided that he would rather be competing against himself than another restaurateur. The original idea for the space was to make a restaurant devoted to roast chicken called \"The Hen House\", but Alefantis and Greenwood decided against it and made the location a pizzeria instead. The name came from a neon \"Comet\" sign that Alefantis found at Comet Liquor in the city's Adams Morgan neighborhood. After Alefantis purchased the location, the DC architecture firm CORE redesigned the space by removing most of the features from the building and making it more \"raw\". Because the location was next door to their other restaurant, Alefantis and Greenwood merged both restaurants' kitchens so they could easily move back and forth between the locations. Alefantis and Greenwood were inspired by New Haven-style pizza in the menu's creation.  Initially, Comet Ping Pong faced challenges: patrons complained that the pizzas were too expensive and that its salad selection was too small. The restaurant changed its menu and was able to find a niche in the gourmet pizza market in the D.C. area. Greenwood served as the chef of both restaurants; she left her position as executive chef and co-owner in 2009 citing urgent family matters and other personal interests. The Washington City Papers Tim Carman in 2009 felt that both Comet and Buck's Fishing & Camping had managed to succeed without Greenwood."

Additionally, Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner Frank Winstead criticized Alefantis for having placed a ping pong table on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant to attract and entertain customers. Winstead published a video on YouTube, \"Ping Pong in Public Space\", which showed people playing ping pong outside the restaurant and implied that the situation was a traffic hazard. Anticipating that he was going to request outside seating, Alefantis brought the table indoors.  Alefantis held a meeting with the local ANC board to formally request that it allow Comet to place outside seating, have live entertainment in the restaurant, and remain open after midnight. The meeting was acrimonious, with some ANC members accusing Alefantis of violating the agreement and holding live entertainment in the venue. Winstead stated that Alefantis was \"trying to turn this area into Adams Morgan with the murders and rapes.\" The ANC decided in Comet's favor by a 4\u20133 vote and the audio recording of the meeting went public.

The rumor was debunked by the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia and sources such as Snopes.com and The New York Times, among others. However, the restaurant's owners and staff were harassed, threatened on social media websites, and given negative Yelp reviews. After continued threats, Comet Ping Pong increased the security for concerts held inside its premises. On December 4, 2016, Edgar Maddison Welch of Salisbury, North Carolina, walked into the restaurant with a semi-automatic rifle and fired three rounds inside the building before being arrested; no one was injured. In addition to the AR-15-style rifle, police seized a Colt .38 caliber handgun, a shotgun, and a folding knife from Welch's car and person. Welch told police that he planned to \"self-investigate\" the conspiracy theory, and was charged with assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a pistol without a license, unlawful discharge of a firearm, and carrying a rifle or shotgun outside the home or business. On June 22, 2017, he was sentenced to four years in prison. On March 3, 2020, Welch was transferred to a Community Corrections Center (CCC) and was released on May 28. In response to the shooting, the restaurant set up a GoFundMe campaign to compensate for additional security, lost wages, and property damage. On Facebook, a local PR consultant set up an event to support the restaurant and nearby businesses affected by the harassment campaign, which thousands of people expressed interest in attending. An arsonist set a fire in the restaurant in January 2019. The fire was quickly put out by restaurant employees and caused no injuries. A man suspected to be the arsonist was later arrested and pleaded guilty at court in December 2019."

The Portland Mercury described Esparza's as a \"quaint little cafe\" with \"interesting\" menu options, including buffalo tostadas, ground ostrich and nopalitos (cactus deep-fried in cornmeal batter). It served several varieties of tongue, including beef, buffalo, calf, lamb, pork and venison. The menu also included beef brisket (\"Smiley Burnette\") and more traditional options such as enchiladas, quesadillas, tacos and tamales, with most entrees ranging from $9\u201311. The most expensive entree on the menu cost $12.95, making Esparza's known for its reasonable pricing. The restaurant's owners, Martha and Joe Esparza, shared four of their recipes with The Oregonian between 1990 and 2002. Joe's recipe for \"Texas-Style Chili Colorado\" was based on one his mother made during his childhood in Uvalde, Texas. His mother disliked short-cut cooking and instead used ground chilies and other seasonings. Joe used a similar method, and his recipe was considered one of Esparza's signature dishes. In 1994, Martha shared her recipe for \"Sudie Mae's Sweet Potato Pecan Pie\", which came from her mother, who would make it on Sundays while growing up in Mineola, Texas. Joe's \"Nopalito Ranchero\" recipe, which he shared with The Oregonian in 1996, became popular after guests \"got over their squeamishness over eating cactus leaves\". The recipe for \"Turkey Guiso a la Tex-Mex\" (guiso is a type of stew), was shared in 2002 and has been recommended for utilizing leftover Thanksgiving turkey. Esparza's \"Dirty Bird\" recipe was shared on the Food Network's The Best Of: Spicy Foods."

We will re-open soon.\" However, several days later, the owners confirmed the restaurant's permanent closure, posting a note that said: \"We have closed our business after 24 years. We would like to thank you for supporting us. We have enjoyed the friendships made over the years. We are starting a new chapter in our lives\u00a0\u2013 relaxing and enjoying life.

In 1992, Esparza's was named The Oregonian \"Restaurant of the Year\". According to the paper, the restaurant played an important role in developing NE and SE 28th Avenue as a food destination. Portland Monthly called the food \"so-so\", but noted its menu, outdoor patio and jukebox, encouraging people to \"bask in the indecipherable harmonies of norte\u00f1o polka crackling from the vintage vinyl-and-neon Wurlitzer\". Esparza's was highlighted in numerous travel guides of Portland. Fodor's published, \"Be prepared for south-of-the-border craziness at this beloved local eatery. Wild West kitsch festoons the walls, but it isn't any wilder than some of the entr\u00e9es that emerge from chef-owner Joe Esparza's kitchen.\" In her book Insiders' Guide to Portland, Oregon, Rachel Dresbeck called the menu \"spicy, flavorful, and tantalizingly aromatic\", and described the atmosphere as \"1950s Texas soda shop\u2014just the right accent to complement the hearty fare\". Yahoo! Travel called the restaurant \"fun, wild and woolly\", offering food \"in the true tradition of the Lone Star State\". Yahoo! recommended the chile rellenos, ostrich enchiladas, or nopalito for a unique dining experience. The restaurant did not receive universal acclaim, however. In a negative review for The Portland Mercury in 2000, Robin Rosenberg wrote: ... one expects the food at Esparza's to be something special; You might think that the line trickling out the door on a Thursday night is an indication of exceptional Tex-Mex, worth a considerable sum. Well, certainly, Esparza's d\u00e8cor, an amalgam of Western nostalgia, Texan brawn, and Tijuana cheese is executed with flair. Unfortunately though, no thematic coup can compensate for the fact that Esparza's food rarely exceeds mediocre, and never lives up to its price... The bulk of the clientele resides in a comfortable economic bracket and come down to the gritty Eastside to quaff top shelf margaritas and feast on manic kitsch. The hot corn chips and fresh salsa, which come fast and free, are the height of the meal. Smoked salmon enchiladas are just wrong; No quantity of barbecue sauce (in this case, cloying and acrid) is going to improve a tough, dry brisket. The pork tacos are equally dry, but the ground buffalo enchiladas are very macho and spicy (though they will linger painfully)... The beans and rice that accompany most entrees are utterly flavorless, a gratuitous use of space on the plate. Some people like beans and rice; Esparza's doesn't seem to care. It's a troublesome adage, 'you get what you pay for,' when you've gorged on flash and formula\u2014and yet, you're starved for a good meal. Following the restaurant's closure, The Oregonian Grant Butler called the run that it had \"remarkable\". He recalled, \"[W]hen Esparza's opened in 1990, it broke the mold of what Mexican fare in Portland could be. Instead of combination plates blanketed in shrouds of sour cream and melted cheddar, Esparza's served dishes that few people in Portlanders [sic] had ever experienced at the time\"."

He supposedly visited Hotel Witt in Kalmar on May 4, 1862, where he wanted to treat his friends to a meal he used to eat in Russia. He ordered the ingredients needed from the kitchen, and the guests were instructed by Lindstr\u00f6m on how to make the patties. The patties were then brought back to the kitchen, where they were fried, and then served. The dish was promptly added to the hotel's menu. The dish remains on the hotel's menu.

Dillingham also used the restaurant as a place to entertain dignitaries, including Harry S Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower. The restaurant closed briefly as a result of the Great Flood of 1951. In 1957, the Golden Ox expanded when a one-story addition was added to the south side of the livestock exchange building to accommodate the restaurant expansion. Jerry Rauschelbach and Steve Greer purchased the Golden Ox from Jerry's father Bill in 1997. In The Golden Ox closed in November 2003 without warning. Rauschelbach cited high beef prices, fewer people dining out, and overall poor economic conditions as reasons for the closure. The restaurant was purchased and reopened two weeks later by a group of investors led by Bill Teel and Steve Greer. Greer retired in August 2014. In December 2014, the Golden Ox announced that it would close permanently before the end of the year. Landlord Bill Haw indicated that the Golden Ox was behind on rent, and Haw planned to pursue a different restaurant or entertainment concept for the restaurant space in the livestock exchange building. Following the 2014 closing of the restaurant, the space was divided, and Stockyards Brewing Co. planned to open in the south portion of the space, which was previously the bar area and one of the back dining areas. In November 2015 it was announced that Wes Gartner and Jill Myers signed a lease for the remaining 5,000-square-foot space, including the main dining room and kitchen on the north side of the original Golden Ox space. Gartner and Myers are also co-owners of Voltaire in the West Bottoms. They announced plans to re-open the Golden Ox, and the renovated space would include a wood-fired grill in a semi-open kitchen. Livestock Exchange Building owner Bill Haw stated that the new owners of the Golden Ox would have access to any furnishing or memorabilia from the previous Golden Ox restaurant. After the massive renovation, Wes and Jill reopened the Golden Ox in June of 2018."

        "content": "While the building has been occupied by bars and restaurants since early in the twentieth century, Clancy's itself was founded in the late 1940s by Ed and Betty Clancy.  Its original incarnation was that of a po' boy restaurant and bar, the typical variety of the era.  In 1983 the Clancy couple, themselves having borne no heir, sold the restaurant to a group of New Orleans businessmen led by Billy Slatten, Bryan Wagner, and the late judge, Marcel Livaudais.  The restaurant was transformed into a fine dining, \"white tablecloth\"-style restaurant, eclipsing its humble beginnings.  It was one of the original Louisiana Creole cuisine bistros that sprung up in the 1980s, now the pre-eminent restaurant style in New Orleans. In 1987, Clancy's was acquired by longtime employee Brad Holingsworth, who has retained the restaurant's status, and has added an extensive wine cellar.  In 2012 chef Steven Manning left to open his own restaurant in the Warehouse District.  His role was taken over by Brian Larson, who already had twenty years experience in Clancy's."

It is a relatively modern dish, dating to sometime after the introduction of the tomato to Iran at the end of the nineteenth century in the Qajar era. Its primary ingredients are cucumber, tomato, onion, olive oil, herbal spices and verjuice, although lime juice is sometimes used in its preparation. In Iran, it is eaten in the summer as a side dish on its own, and year-round as a side dish alongside meat-based foods such as kebab and as a side dish before and after meals. Shirazi salad is sometimes served as an accompaniment to rice such as loobia polo, an Iranian rice dish made with green beans and tomatoes. Cookbook author Jila Dana-Haeri describes it as a refreshing dish during the summer. Shirazi salad has been described as being akin to a national salad in Iran, and it is a common meal accompaniment. It may also be used in a manner similar to that of a condiment, to reduce the spiciness of stews. It typically has a crisp and moist texture, and is somewhat similar to pico de gallo and Israeli salad."

The salad may have a sour and salty flavor, and its flavor may increase after being set for an hour or longer before serving, which allows time for the flavors to intermingle.

The restaurant moved to a larger venue on Voltaire Street in 1979 after the previous landlord doubled the rent, at which point the business started to see increased turnover and success. Hodad's moved to its current location on Newport Avenue in 1991, taking just four days to open. The restaurant expanded into a second location in downtown San Diego on the corner of Broadway in 2011, named \"Hodad's Too\" and approximately twice the size as their other outlet. Hodad's began selling its products in Petco Park after signing a partnership with the San Diego Padres. To celebrate this partnership, Mike Hardin threw the first pitch at the July 5, 2012 Padres game versus the Cincinnati Reds. As of 2015, the restaurant estimated that it sells between 1,200 and 1,500 hamburgers daily. Hodad's is popular among both tourists and locals, with queues at times taking hours to get through."

It is based on a well-known Hainanese dish called Wenchang chicken (), which is one of four important Hainan dishes dating to the Qin dynasty. The Hainanese in China traditionally used a specific breed, the Wenchang chicken, to make the dish. The original dish was adapted by the Hainanese overseas Chinese population in the Nanyang area (present-day Southeast Asia). Almost every country in Asia with a history of immigration from China has a version. The San Francisco Chronicle says, \"the dish maps 150 years\u2019 immigration from China's Hainan Island...to Singapore and Malaysia, where the dish is often known as Hainan chicken rice; to Vietnam, where it is called \"Hai Nam chicken\"; and to Thailand, where it has been renamed \"khao man gai\" (\"fatty rice chicken\").\""

The first chicken rice restaurants opened in Singapore during Japanese occupation in World War II, when the British were forced out and their Hainanese servants lost their source of income. One of the first was Yet Con, which opened in the early 1940s. There were also sources stating that Wang Yiyuan, a street hawker first started selling \"chicken rice balls wrapped in banana leaves \" in Singapore during the 1920s. The dish was popularised in Singapore in the 1950s by Moh Lee Twee, whose Swee Kee Chicken Rice Restaurant operated from 1947 to 1997. Hong Kong food critic Chua Lam credits Moh with the creation of the dish. Hainanese chicken rice is considered one of Singapore's national dishes. It is eaten \"everywhere, every day\" in Singapore and is a \"ubiquitous sight in hawker centres across the country\". The chicken is typically served with seasoned rice, with chilli sauce and usually with cucumber garnishes. While most commonly associated with Singaporean cuisine, the dish is also seen throughout Southeast Asia and in parts of the United States, where the dish is named \"Singapore chicken rice\" in some places. The dish is widely popular in Singapore and can be found in hawker centres, restaurants and hotels. In August 2021, Singapore's McDonald's launched a Hainanese Chicken burger which is significantly derived from the dish, in part of the country's celebration for National Day which falls on 9 August."

Some restaurant in Pratunam received Bib Gourmand awards from the 2018 Michelin Guide. It has been reported that these restaurants are especially popular amongst Hong Kong, Japanese and Taiwanese tourists.

The dish is widely served in the Malay Archipelago, especially in Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, Java and Borneo. The thick and yellowish gulai sauce is one of the most common sauces found in Minangkabau cuisine, used to give a rich and spicy taste to meats, fish, and vegetables. Gulai is often described as succulent and spicy, yet subtly combining flavours of different spices into one suave and smooth taste which makes it difficult to figure out the individual spices used. The ingredients are simmered and slowly cooked in coconut milk, a mixture of spices and chili pepper. The thick golden, yellowish, succulent and spicy gulai sauce has become a hallmark that can be seen on window displays of restaurant establishments in Padang, Indonesia. In Padang, smart cooking means being capable of preparing gulai. Rendang (beef simmered in coconut milk and spices), asam padeh (sour and spicy stew) and kalio (watery and light-coloured gravy) are often considered as variations of Padang gulai. In Malaysia, Asam Pedas, a popular Malay sour fish soup is sometimes called gulai tumis. In Perak and Pahang, gulai tempoyak, a local specialty is commonly served as a daily meal and a meal for festive celebrations such as Hari Raya and wedding ceremonies. In some restaurants, roti canai (which is usually servered with curry) might also be served with gulai. The gulai sauce found in Minangkabau, Acehnese, and Malay cuisine usually has a thicker consistency than the gulai sauce found in Java which is thinner, served in soup-like dishes containing pieces of mutton, beef or offal.

Fodor's wrote that \"little seems to have changed at this time warp since the height of the British Empire\". The French painter Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec patronised Sweetings in the 19th century. Sweetings has been owned by Richard Barfoot since 2001 who bought it from the widow of Graham Needham. Needham had owned it since 1980. Barfoot also supplies Sweeting's sustainably sourced seafood. According to Barfoot, Needham told him that the gangster George Francis once offered him  from a suitcase for Sweetings but Needham said, \"I don't want to know and if you are going to trouble me like that you can get out now\". Sweetings is located in the Grade II listed Albert Buildings at 39\u201353 Queen Victoria Street, built in 1871."

The waiters and waitresses are trapped behind wooden counters and serve only the eight or so customers in front of them. There is an etiquette about when you can talk to them but, after countless visits, I can't work it out. Chef Fergus Henderson proposed to his wife, Margot, at Sweetings and wrote that their Black Velvet (Guinness and champagne cocktail) \"puts you in the mood for romance\". The black velvet was also praised by designer Phillipe Starck who felt that upon drinking it from a tankard \"you are really in England\"."

Established by Clifton and Alma Washington at 35 N. Kentucky Avenue, Atlantic City, in 1937, the original 20-seat location attained celebrity status for hosting the performers and patrons of the nightclubs in the Kentucky Avenue black entertainment district. The restaurant was known for its sausage sandwiches and soul food, and also served breakfast to customers leaving the 6 a.m. show at Club Harlem. In the 1950s Clifton Washington moved the restaurant a few blocks away to 1702 Arctic Avenue, where it was renamed Wash & Sons' Seafood Restaurant and specialized in seafood, barbecued ribs, and fried chicken. This larger venue, seating over 100, continued to attract both black and white nightclub guests and was also popular with black hotel employees leaving their shifts. Washington's children and grandchildren all worked in the restaurant from a young age, and those who married into the family were also put to work. With the commercial downturn in Atlantic City in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Wash's relocated to 128 N. New Road in Pleasantville in 1974. Renamed Wash's Inn and Wash's Catering, the business now focused on catering on-site events and also operated a small dining room, take-out deli, and bar. With the 1994 addition of a large catering hall, the facility hosted hundreds of private parties and community events. The family put the business up for sale in 2010 and closed it in 2012."

The young couple moved into Atlantic City's Northside, home to black families in the racially segregated city since World War I, and raised seven children. In 1937 they decided to enter the restaurant business and opened Wash's Restaurant at 35 N. Kentucky Avenue. The restaurant's name was a short form of the family name Washington. The family name came from Clifton's early-19th-century ancestor, a slave in Dinwiddie County, Virginia, who changed his surname to Washington after his emancipation. While Clifton operated a jitney, Alma managed the sandwich shop in the mornings and was assisted by her sons after school and on weekends. Alma prepared most of the food on-site. The restaurant began by selling sausage sandwiches, hot dogs, five-cent milkshakes, one-cent cigarettes, and candy. Breakfast fare of bacon and eggs was served to guests leaving Club Harlem's 6 a.m. show. Soul food entrees were added after customers saw Alma preparing beef stew or chicken and dumplings for her family and asked if they could buy that too. Though it had only six tables, with maximum seating for 20, the restaurant became a popular venue for the entertainers and guests attending the Kentucky Avenue nightclubs, including Club Harlem, the Paradise Club, and Grace's Little Belmont. Among the entertainers who ate at the restaurant after their sets ended were Redd Foxx, Nipsey Russell, Count Basie, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Moms Mabley. In the 1950s Washington's sons broke an outside wall to create a take-out window for fried chicken and seafood meals."

The restaurant was renamed Wash & Sons' Seafood Restaurant and sported large picture windows; the interior had a seashell motif, flower boxes, and placemats with beach scenes. Industrial ceiling fans cooled off the dining area. By the summer of 1953 the new restaurant had been completely renovated and could seat more than 100 customers. Soul food specialties included seafood, barbecued ribs, fried chicken, and sweet potato pie, as well as a full breakfast menu including bacon, sausage, eggs, pancakes, grits, and home fries. Washington's children and grandchildren all worked in the restaurant from a young age, and those who married into the family were also put to work. The standard pay for family members was $35 a week; they could make another $100 or more per week in tips, especially during the night shifts. During the summer tourist season, Raheem recalled: The adult males would work their permanent eight-hour day jobs and arrive at the restaurant in time to eat dinner before the extremely busy night shift. The adult females would run the day shift as cooks, cashiers and hostesses, then return home in the evening to tend to their houses and children. Other family, friends and neighbors worked as pantry help, busboys, dishwashers, waiters and waitresses. By day the restaurant hosted families and tourists before they spent the day at the beach or boardwalk. By night it welcomed the nightclub set, including free-spending parties of 15 to 20, and was also popular with black hotel employees after their shifts. It was a favorite of black and white customers alike. The restaurant weathered a downturn beginning in the late 1960s, when many black-owned businesses in Atlantic City were closing. It closed in 1974."

It has received considerable critical acclaim over the years. It was originally in Kings Road Chelsea, but relocated to St James's, London in 2015. Chutney Mary pioneered in redefining the public face of Indian cuisines by showcasing the gourmet foods from 6 to 8 different regions of India at any one time. It had the rigorous philosophy that the foods of the different regions could best be cooked by the chefs from that region. It was an extremely ambitious undertaking and akin to having a pan European gourmet.  Chutney Mary was probably the first Indian restaurant in the world to trace the regional provenance of each dish. Chutney Mary was also pioneered as an Indian restaurant in taking wines seriously, and led the way in the pairing of Indian food and wine. The regional provenance and the dishes on the Chutney Mary proved the trailblazer for the supermarket packaged foods \u2013 e.g. Waitrose which from the mid-1990s started prepared dishes with the regional provenance and with names from the Chutney Mary menu."

It held three preview events\u2014a private event with local blues duo Curtis Salgado and Alan Hager on May 18, a multi-course seated dinner on May 19, and \"Sunday Jazz Brunch with Pete Krebs\" on May 20\u2014before opening to the public on May 22. The 80-seat restaurant replaced In Good Taste, a cooking school which occupied the space for eleven years and closed in February 2012. Its name (inspired by Louisiana's administrative divisions) was reflected by the restaurant's \"ecclesiastical\" interior, which included gray and pewter-colored \"cathedral-esque\" arches over the bar and a host stand which was a refurbished Prohibition-era Mississippi church pulpit. The Cajun, Louisiana Creole, and New Orleans-style seafood restaurant served entrees such as andouille, \u00e9touff\u00e9e, frog legs, jambalaya, maque choux, pork belly, and turtle soup, and was best known for its oysters. Its bar, Vieux Carr\u00e9 (French Quarter), served New Orleans cocktails including Bourbon-based drinks, daiquiris, and house infusions. The Parish's  interior, designed by Mark Annen, had a shucking station, oak floors, French-blue walls with gray accents, exposed brickwork, subway tiles, and salvaged woodwork. Hogan and Powell reportedly worked at both Eat: An Oyster Bar and The Parish, switching daily. Like Eat, The Parish was a wholesale supplier of sustainably-farmed oysters to other Portland restaurants. Powell said about the difference between the two restaurants: When we were doing the oyster bar, we wanted a turn-of-the-20th-century, early-1900s style\u2014what you would find in Slidell, a po' boy shop with good gumbo and jambalaya, a little rowdy, where people consumed a lot of booze. The idea behind The Parish is to take it uptown, to the 1920s ... and (New Orleans') Garden District. In July and August 2015, the restaurant was split in half, with one side serving brunch, lunch, and happy hour as the Palmetto Cafe. The 38-seat cafe's brunch menu included breakfast sandwiches, burritos, and pastries; its lunch menu included a fried green tomato sandwich with pimento cheese and coleslaw, po' boys, salads, and shrimp and grits. Fried chicken, kolaches, natchitoches meat pies, pimento cheeseburgers, seafood salads, and soft-boiled eggs were happy-hour menu items. In February 2016, the Palmetto was converted into a private event space and pop-up restaurant, and The Parish resumed serving lunch from 11:30 am to 3:00 pm on Fridays and Saturdays. The restaurant closed abruptly in September 2016, with little explanation."

Even though the host and guests may see each other often socially, one day's gathering can never be repeated exactly. The phrase \u201cichigo-ichie\u201d has two parts: \u201cichigo\u201d means \u201cone life\u201d and \u201cichie\u201d means \u201ca one-time encounter.\u201d And so this is often translated as \u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\u201d This phrase originated with the tea ceremony, where it expresses the feelings of the host to show sincere hospitality towards guests."

Like the restaurant's potato salad, it seems vitally lacking in ingredients that would elevate its character, chopped onion, for example, chopped pickle and more herbs such as parsley. It is too bland for one palate.\" When Zum Zum opened a restaurant in Harvard Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1969, The Harvard Crimson's restaurant critic Esther Dyson described its fare as follows: \"Unless you like German food \u2014 about five different kinds of wursts \u2014 it's best to stick to the frankfurter with sauerkraut, a big juicy hotdog for 35 cents. The desserts, doughnuts, fruit salad, and apple crumbles, are also cheap and good. What Zum Zum does best is breakfast, the standard fare plus apple pancakes, although you have to eat it off pewter plates. A nice filling breakfast with assorted German jams and maple syrup will cost you just a dollar.\" Dyson also noted that the restaurant did not supply ketchup, \"being strictly German,\" but instead had \"china pots of mustard cutely labeled 'Das Sweet' and 'Das Hot'.\""

Early on, Delta had a \"symbiotic bar-restaurant relationship\" with nearby Lutz Tavern, where guests on the waiting list for restaurant seating could wait at the bar. Before cell phones, Lutz staff would receive calls from Delta and announce when parties could be seated. Corya and Pace sold the business in June 2007, then opened Miss Delta on Mississippi Avenue in north Portland in August 2007. Two of Delta Cafe's cooks, Jennifer Hazzard and Chuck Westmoreland, also became co-owners of Miss Delta and continued serving Southern cuisine. In 2012, Delta celebrated its seventeenth anniversary by offering forty-ounce Pabsts to patrons for $2.50, the price of the drink when the restaurant was founded. In 2016, a mural was painted on the restaurant's west exterior as part of a neighborhood beautification initiative called the Woodstock Street Art Project. Funded in part by Metro and the Regional Arts & Culture Council, this and two other murals in the neighborhood were completed by Travis Czekalski and Jon Stommel, the art duo known as Rather Severe. Delta began serving brunch daily in November 2016. The restaurant has also hosted Halloween and Mardi Gras celebrations."

He described Delta as \"a staple for Reedies and other Woodstock residents\" and recommended, \"Bring a big appetite, especially for the huge brunch portions.\" Nathan Williams recommended Delta in the website's 2022 overview of eateries in the Woodstock neighborhood. Portland Monthly has said the restaurant \"thrives largely on an aesthetic of thrift-store kitsch, its double-wide ambience as brazen as a belle on a bender\", and described the Delta Lounge as a \"decorously knickknacked\" bar with \"inscrutably balanced\" cocktails. The magazine said: \"Indeed, the Delta\u2019s drinks temper the hipster vibe of the place, and the alternately sophisticated and rowdy infusions impart a charm and good humor often lost on many of Portland's swankier and pricier drinking establishments. Which makes any trip here a worthwhile foray into rebel territory.\" Portland Monthly John Chandler called Delta Cafe \"a joint that earned its rep by dropping huge platters of Southern cooking on its customers for embarrassingly small sums of money\" and wrote in 2010, \"I can remember ordering the meatloaf special\u2014with two sides\u2014for five freakin' dollars. The Delta was never a bastion of culinary precision, and that's still the case, but the heaping portions are standard issue, and if you can make it to Happy Hour (3\u20136 daily), the prices are straight out of the late 20th century.\" Thrillist recommends the restaurant \"for old-school fried chicken, just like mom used to make\". Zagat gives Delta ratings of 4.5 for food, 4.1 for decor, and 4.3 for service, each on a scale of 5. The guide said, \"For tasty, homestyle Southern fare with Cajun inflections that comes in big, price-appropriate portions, locals point to this quirky Woodstock cafe as a perfect fit for eccentric East Portland; helpful servers contribute to the vibe, although for some it comes down to the PBR 40s on ice \u2013 isn't that why everyone goes?\" Delta has been included in travel guides and walking tours of Portland."

        "content": "For Roadfood, Jane and Michael Stern rated the diner 4.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"Off the tourist path but loved by locals, Fuller's is not only prime Portland; it is a taste of the sort of high-quality urban hash house now nearly vanished from most American cities.\" In 2016, Willamette Week recommended the breakfast special and said, \"Take one step in Fuller's, and you'll feel like you're back in 1947\". The newspaper's Walker MacMurdo wrote, \"You'll be hard-pressed to find a breakfast this big and this good at this price anywhere else on the westside, let alone in the rest of the city. In an area that has developed into a jungle of Chipotle-wave d\u00e9cor, millennial apartment complexes and elite boutiques, Fuller's remains a deservedly popular bastion of a bygone time when elderly men in overalls could enjoy a glass of milk with their omelet.\" Portland Mercury Megan Burbank wrote in 2017: The Oregonian Michael Russell has described the cheeseburger as \"what a McDonald's burger might still look like if the global corporation hadn't been worrying about shareholders for the past five decades\". He included Fuller's in his 2018\u20132020 overviews of the city's \"best inexpensive restaurants\". Russell called Fuller's \"the best of Portland's classic diners\", and also included the diner in his 2019 guide to the city's best brunches. Lizzy Acker and Russell ranked Fuller's number 21 in a 2019 list of the city's best corned beef hashes, and said, \"The food is good, the prices are hard to beat, but it's the old-school ambiance and friendly (but not overly friendly) service that keep us coming back to Fuller's.\" In 2018, Food & Wine David Landsel also said that the diner appears \"out of a Hopper painting\" and called the omelettes \"pretty great\". His 2020 overview of the nation's best diners described Fuller's as an \"alluring corner joint where each seat in the restaurant is a counter seat, backed by giant windows that even on the darkest days, lend Portland's finest no-nonsense diner an abundance of natural light. Classic it may be, but there's a distinctive creativity to the menu here, nearly essential in a town where breakfast and brunch are essentially a new kind of religion\". Landsel recommended that diners \"try the indulgent Monte Cristo sandwich, or simply appreciate just how good a plate of bacon, eggs, and potatoes can be, when someone back behind the counter gives a damn about quality. Other breakfasts may be more famous, but let them wait for another day\u2014at Fuller's, chances are you won't feel like you're missing out, at all.\" Eater Portland Erin DeJesus included Fuller's in her 2013 list of the twelve \"best restaurants for dining solo\" in the city, in which she said that the diner \"maintains that old-school, every-man-for-himself vibe\" and recommended a visit \"for morning/lunchtime solo diners (or those who bury themselves in the newspaper when eating alone)\". In a 2016 list of \"Portland's 12 Iconic Greasy Spoon Breakfasts\", the website said, \"Fuller's isn't old-fashioned; it's just old... The food is so basic you really could cook it at home, but the ambience and shared conversation around the counter makes you glad something so old has survived in this part of town.\" For Eater Portland 2020 list of \"17 Old-School Restaurants Every Portlander Must Try\", Heather Arndt Anderson and Krista Garcia described Fuller's as a \"Pearl District holdout\" with \"a lunch counter in the true sense of the word\". In 2019, Bob Hicks of Oregon ArtsWatch described Fuller's as a \"pillar of a rapidly changing community\" and wrote, \"to the city's developers and speculators I have just three words: Hands off, dammit.\" During the COVID-19 pandemic, Eater Portland published a list of \"real-deal\" and \"essential breakfasts that hold their own for takeout and delivery\", in which Kara Stokes and Brooke Jackson-Glidden identified select takeout options and said of the diner, \"When breakfast calls for no more than greasy spoon simplicity and endless coffee refills, there's nothing like Fuller's\". Fuller's Burger Shack's entr\u00e9e ranked number seven in Portland Monthly 2020 list of the city's 20 best cheeseburgers; comparing the cheeseburger to the version served at Fuller's Coffee Shop, writers for the magazine said that \"the Burger Shack version is a hair better than the coffee shop original. What we loved: the warm creaminess, the perfect proportions, the luscious char, the splendid crunch of whole iceberg leaves, the way the cheese pooled over the edges\". Thrillist said that the diner feels \"like something you'd find on the way out of town, not a couple minutes from what people don't actually call Portland's financial district (even though it's true). The food is cheap but delicious. It's not trying to be anything other than a place for properly cooked eggs, crispy hash browns, and a seemingly never-ending cup of hot coffee.\" Fodor's Inside Portland (2020) described Fuller's as a \"reliably good greasy spoon\" with an \"endearing\" neon sign."

The Uptown restaurant's interior had a \"soaring wood-beamed ceiling and stately stone walls\", according to the Houston Press, and featured a wood-burning grill and \"omnipresent\" televisions. The Houston Chronicle described the interior decor as \"wildly eclectic\" and \"full of bright signs and dramatic architecture\", with a high vaulted ceiling, large wooden beams, and \"impressive drop lights scattered throughout\". There were two stone fireplaces, both of which had large mounted swordfish above mantles, as well as a mural of Greek settings and a \"luxuriously appointed\" bar. The wall opposite the kitchen and counter with five mounted televisions displayed Greek food signs. Guests placed orders at the counter during lunch and had orders taken by waiting staff during evening hours. Staff wore jeans and blue or black T-shirts with the restaurant's logo, as of 2004. Patrons ate at wooden tables covered with blue checkered tablecloths and set with bottles of Apella wine available for purchase. The restaurant played Greek music in the background. Houstonia described the interior as \"cavernous\" and said Yia Yia Mary's was \"the area's only Greek fish specialist\". The airport restaurant was located near Gate 1. The menu at the Uptown restaurant included seafood such as branzino, calamari, lobster, and shrimp, as well as gyros served with French fries, lamb, moussaka, pastitsio, saganaki, souvlaki (beef, chicken, or lamb), and spanakopita. Gyros had rotisserie-cooked beef and lamb in pita with onions, tomatoes, and tzatziki. The lobster oregano was served with Greek salad and herb rice or lemon-buttered roasted potatoes. The meze (appetizer) menu had baked feta, dolmades, fried calamari, Greek meatballs, and lamb chops steeped in garlic and oregano, and roasted eggplant dip. The appetizer sampler had pita, olives, and five dips, including eggplant with garlic and olive oil, hummus, one made with red peppers and feta, skordalia, and caviar-flavored taramasalata. The \"Yia Yia sampler\" had feta in olive oil and was served with dolmades, pita, spanakopita, and tiropita. Side salads had iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, feta, and pickled peppers. Happy hour was available all day on Wednesdays, as of 2017. The airport restaurant had gluten-free and vegetable-based options, as well as a falafel platter."

The brothers named the restaurant after their grandmother Mary (\"Yia Yia\" means \"Grandma\" in Greek), and the interior displayed photographs of her. The restaurant was popular early on; in March, the Houston Chronicle described a full parking lot during lunch time and the presence of traffic police outside. By mid 2006, carpeting had been installed in the dining area, lowering the noise level, and standard table service had replaced the \"fast-food, walk-up counter concept\". In 2012, a former Yia Yia Mary's employee filed a lawsuit over wage disputes and claimed Pappas Restaurants \"failed to pay Plaintiff and other wait staff the minimum wage\". The plaintiff said the invalid tip pool \"included workers who were not customarily and regularly tipped, including, [...] each restaurant's dishwashing staff\", and sought damages to \"recover compensation for [...] unpaid minimum wages, including the full amount of tips received\", for current and former waiting staff \"who were paid with a tip credit and required to contribute to a tip pool\", and attorney's fees. The restaurant's meatloaf was featured on the menu of Pappas Meat Co., a steakhouse opened by Pappas Restaurants in 2014. Yia Yia Mary's was announced as a vendor at Hobby Airport in July 2015. Both locations closed in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Yia Yia Mary's at Hobby Airport closed in May, and the Uptown restaurant closed in June.

At peak rush hour, you can hardly hear yourself think, much less chew.\" Yia Yia Mary's was nominated in the Best New Restaurant category in the Houston Business Journal Reader's Dining Survey in 2004. In 2006, Robb Walsh of the Houston Press appreciated the lower noise level, which he said was \"unbearable\" upon opening. He called the sampler dips and the gyro with fries \"outstanding\" the taramosalata \"excellent\". Conversely, Walsh criticized the moussaka, the chicken souvlaki sandwich (which he called \"too boring to finish\"), and the salad with beef souvlaki, which \"proved doubly disappointing\". He opined, \"The fresh-scrubbed college kids who work as servers at Yia Yia Mary's make it possible for xenophobic Houstonians to eat Greek food without having to enter a hive of swarthy foreigners... It may be Greek, but it's still a Pappas Bros. restaurant, after all: a big, efficient, impersonal operation where the sandwiches come in plastic baskets, the bathrooms are always spotless, and you don't have to deal with any colorful personalities.\" Yia Yia Mary's was a finalist in the Best Greek category in OutSmart Readers' Choice Awards in 2011, 2015, and 2017. In her Insiders' Guide to Houston (2012), Laura Nathan-Garner recommended the appetizer menu's baked feta, roasted eggplant dip, and spanakopita for a variety of foods on a budget and wrote, \"All of the options can feel a little overwhelming at this Pappas-owned restaurant. But just about everything\u2014from the moussaka to the Greek salad to the pita to the souvlaki\u2014is worth a try.\" In 1,000 Foods to Eat Before You Die (2015), Mimi Sheraton recommended Yia Yia Mary's for pastitsio and saganaki. In 2015, Katerina Papathanasiou of the Greek Reporter said Yia Yia Mary's \"hosts the perfect menu of authentic Greek cuisine\" and recommended the \"fabulous\" appetizers. Katharine Shilcutt included Yia Yia Mary's in Houstonia 2016 list of the ten best eateries in Houston's airports and called the falafel platter \"heavenly\".
