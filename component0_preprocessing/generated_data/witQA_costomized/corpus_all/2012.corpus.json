It is part of traditional culture in Quebec, Eastern Ontario, New Brunswick and northern New England. In these regions, it is poured onto the snow, then lifted either with a small wooden stick, such as a popsicle stick, or a metal dinner fork."

        "content": "The candy is made by boiling maple syrup to about 112 \u00b0C (234 \u00b0F). It is best to use a candy thermometer. The thick liquid may be kept hot over a very low flame or in a pan of hot water, but should not be stirred as it will form grainy crystals. This liquid is then poured in a molten state upon clean snow, whereupon the cold causes it to rapidly thicken. If the syrup runs, rather than hardens, when it is poured on the snow, then it has not yet been boiled long enough to make the soft maple candy. Once sufficiently hardened, the candy can be picked up and eaten. The higher a temperature one boils the initial syrup, the thicker the final result will be. As it is popularly eaten soft, it is usually served fresh. It is most often prepared and eaten alongside the making of maple syrup at a sugar shack, or cabane \u00e0 sucre."

In New England, the practice is sometimes called a sugar on snow party, and the soft candy is traditionally served with donuts, sour dill pickles, and coffee. The pickles and coffee serve to counter the intense sweetness of the candy.\nMaple taffy is also made in the Canadian province of Manitoba using syrup from the Manitoba maple tree (also known as a box elder). The syrup and taffy produced from a Manitoba maple are generally darker and have a mustier flavour than that made from sugar maples."

It is a thick paste produced by fermenting soybeans with salt and k\u014dji (the fungus Aspergillus oryzae) and sometimes rice, barley, seaweed, or other ingredients. It is used for sauces and spreads, pickling vegetables, fish, or meats, and mixing with dashi soup stock to serve as miso soup, a Japanese culinary staple. Miso is high in protein and rich in vitamins and minerals, and it played an important nutritional role in feudal Japan. Miso is still widely used in both traditional and modern cooking in Japan and has been gaining worldwide interest.Typically, miso is salty, but its flavor and aroma depend on the ingredients and fermentation process. Different varieties of miso have been described as salty, sweet, earthy, fruity, and savory."

        "content": "The origin of miso of Japan is not completely clear. \n\nGrain and fish misos had been manufactured in Japan since the Neolithic era (J\u014dmon period, 14,000\u2013300 BC). These are called j\u014dmon miso and are similar to the early fish- and soy-based sauces produced throughout East Asia.\nThis miso predecessor originated in China during the third century BC. Hishio (\u91a4) and other fermented soy-based foods likely were introduced to Japan at the same time as Buddhism in the sixth century AD. This fermented food was called shi. The beginning of the current origin of miso is mish\u014d or mishou (\u672a\u91a4) in the Nara period (710\u2013794); with hishio still meaning beans. It is believed that the word changed to Misho and then Miso.In the Kamakura period (1185\u20131333), a common meal was made up of a bowl of rice, some dried fish, a serving of miso, and a fresh vegetable. Until the Muromachi period (1337 to 1573), miso was made without grinding the soybeans, somewhat like natt\u014d. In the Muromachi era, Buddhist monks discovered that soybeans could be ground into a paste, spawning new methods using miso to flavor other foods. In medieval times, the word temaemiso, meaning homemade miso, appeared. Miso production is relatively simple, so homemade versions spread throughout Japan. Miso was used as military provisions during the Sengoku period, and making miso was an important economic activity for daimy\u014ds of that era.\nDuring the Edo period (1603\u20131868), miso was also called hishio (\u91a4) and kuki (\u8c46\u652f) and various types of miso that fit with each local climate and culture emerged throughout Japan.\nToday, miso is produced industrially in large quantities, and traditional homemade miso has become a rarity. In recent years, many new types of miso have appeared, including ones with added soup stocks or calcium, made with beans other than soy, or having reduced salt for health, among other varieties available."

Lately, producers in other countries have also begun selling miso made from chickpeas, corn, azuki beans, amaranth, and quinoa. Fermentation time ranges from as little as five days to several years.

        "content": "The taste, aroma, texture, and appearance of miso vary by region and season. Other important variables that contribute to the flavor of a particular miso include temperature, duration of fermentation, salt content, variety of k\u014dji, and fermenting vessel. The most common flavor categories of miso are:\n\nShiromiso, \"white miso\"\nAkamiso, \"red miso\"\nAwasemiso, \"mixed miso\"Although white and red (shiromiso and akamiso) are the most common misos available, different varieties may be preferred in particular regions of Japan. In the eastern Kant\u014d region that includes Tokyo, the darker brownish akamiso is popular while in the western Kansai region encompassing Osaka, Kyoto, and Kobe, the lighter shiromiso is preferred.\nA more nuanced breakdown of the flavors is as follows:\n\nKome miso (\u7c73\u5473\u564c) or \"rice miso\" can be yellow, yellowish white, red, etc. Whitish miso is made from boiled soybeans, and reddish miso is made from steamed soybeans. Kome miso is consumed more in eastern Japan and the Hokuriku and Kinki areas.\nMugi miso (\u9ea6\u5473\u564c) or \"barley miso\" is a whitish miso produced in Kyushu, western Chugoku, and Shikoku areas. Another reddish mugi miso is produced in the northern Kanto area. Mugi miso has a peculiar smell.\nMame miso (\u8c46\u5473\u564c) or \"soybean miso\" is a darker, more reddish brown than kome miso. This is not as sweet as some other varieties, but it has some astringency and good umami (\u65e8\u5473) flavor. This miso requires a long maturing term. Mame miso is consumed mostly in Aichi prefecture, Gifu prefecture, and Mie prefecture. Soybean (grain-free) miso is also labeled hatch\u014d miso (\u516b\u4e01\u5473\u564c). Hatch\u014d miso is an Okazaki, Aichi specialty and has its origins in Mikawa Province during the Sengoku period. The processing method with large wooden barrels and stones on the lid remains unchanged.\nCh\u014dg\u014d (\u8abf\u5408) or Awase (\u5408\u308f\u305b) miso, or \"mixed miso\", comes in many types because it is a mixture or compound of other varieties of miso. This may improve the weak points of each type of miso. For example, mame miso is very salty, but when combined with kome miso, the finished product has a mild taste.\nAkamiso (\u8d64\u5473\u564c) or red miso is aged, sometimes for more than one year. As a result, due to the Maillard reaction, the color changes gradually from white to red or black, thus giving it the name red miso. Characteristics of the flavor are saltiness and some astringency with umami. It is often a much stronger-tasting miso. Factors in the depth of color are the formula of the soybeans and the quantity used. Generally, steamed soybeans are more deeply colored than boiled soybeans.\nShiromiso (\u767d\u5473\u564c) or white miso is the most widely produced miso, made in many regions of the country. Its main ingredients are rice, barley, and a small quantity of soybeans. If more soybeans were added, the miso would be red or brown. Compared with red miso, white miso has a very short fermentation time. The taste is sweet, and the umami is soft or light (compared to red miso)."

Miso, depending on the variety, consists of a starter culture called k\u014dji (\u9eb9), soybeans, and usually a grain (either rice, barley, or rye). The miso goes through a two-step process; first creating the k\u014dji, and second the k\u014dji is combined with the other components, and the mixture is left to be enzymatically digested, fermented and aged."

Natural miso is a living food containing many beneficial microorganisms such as Tetragenococcus halophilus, which can be killed by overcooking. For this reason, the miso should be added to soups or other foods prepared just before they are removed from the heat.  Using miso without any cooking may be even better. Outside Japan, a popular practice is to add miso only to foods that have cooled to preserve k\u014djikin cultures in miso. Nonetheless, miso and soy foods play a large role in the Japanese diet, and many cooked miso dishes are popular."

Its primary ingredients are cucumber, tomato, onion, olive oil, herbal spices and verjuice, although lime juice is sometimes used in its preparation. In Iran, it is eaten in the summer as a side dish on its own, and year-round as a side dish alongside meat-based foods such as kebab and as a side dish before and after meals. Shirazi salad is sometimes served as an accompaniment to rice such as loobia polo, an Iranian rice dish made with green beans and tomatoes. Cookbook author Jila Dana-Haeri describes it as a refreshing dish during the summer.Shirazi salad has been described as being akin to a national salad in Iran, and it is a common meal accompaniment. It may also be used in a manner similar to that of a condiment, to reduce the spiciness of stews.

This mini banquet is most suitable for dining in a group. After being seated, patrons are served (without prompt) a set of dishes by waiters whose arms are stacked with plates. The dishes, usually numbering a dozen, typically includes beef rendang, curried fish, stewed greens, chili eggplant, curried beef liver, tripe, intestines or foot tendons, fried beef lung, fried chicken, and sambal, the spicy sauces ubiquitous at Indonesian tables.\nNasi padang served this way is akin to an at-your-table, by-the-plate buffet.

Although Peking duck can trace its history many centuries back, Quanjude's heritage of roast duck preparation \u2013 using open ovens and non-smoky hardwood fuel such as Chinese date, peach, or pear to add a subtle fruity flavor with a golden crisp to the skin \u2013 was originally reserved for the imperial families.\nThe first Quanjude manager, Yang Renquan, who started out selling chicken and ducks, paid a retired chef from the palace for the imperial recipe. Soon after, Quanjude began to serve roast duck from the imperial kitchen to the common masses. Yang Renquan opened his first, small Dejuquan (\u5fb7\u805a\u5168, the three characters being reversed from the current name) inside Yangrou Hutong in Qianmen (\u524d\u9580), which at the time was one of the busiest areas in Beijing. His restaurant became an instant success and has since grown into the current branch in Qianmen that employs over 400 staff members and can occupy 900 guests at one time. The Qianmen restaurant, along with the many other Quanjude branches, together form one of the largest food enterprises in the nation.\nAfter the 1949 establishment of the People's Republic of China, Quanjude was gradually collectivized."

The dish is widely served in the Malay Archipelago, especially in Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, Java and Borneo. The thick and yellowish gulai sauce is one of the most common sauces found in Minangkabau cuisine, used to give a rich and spicy taste to meats, fish, and vegetables. Gulai is often described as succulent and spicy, yet subtly combining flavours of different spices into one suave and smooth taste which makes it difficult to figure out the individual spices used.The ingredients are simmered and slowly cooked in coconut milk, a mixture of spices and chili pepper. The thick golden, yellowish, succulent and spicy gulai sauce has become a hallmark that can be seen on window displays of restaurant establishments in Padang, Indonesia. In Padang, smart cooking means being capable of preparing gulai. Rendang (beef simmered in coconut milk and spices), asam padeh (sour and spicy stew) and kalio (watery and light-coloured gravy) are often considered as variations of Padang gulai.In Malaysia, asam pedas, a popular Malay sour fish soup is sometimes called gulai tumis. In the states of Perak and Pahang, gulai tempoyak, a local specialty is commonly served as a daily meal and a meal for festive celebrations such as Hari Raya and wedding ceremonies. Negeri Sembilan is well known nationwide for its spicy dishes. Masak lemak cili api, a type of gulai made with coconut milk spiced with turmeric and bird's eye chili, is described as the hallmark of Negeri Sembilanese cuisine. In some restaurants, roti canai (which is usually served with curry) might also be served with gulai.\nThe gulai sauce found in Minangkabau, Acehnese, and Malay cuisine usually has a thicker consistency than the gulai sauce found in Java which is thinner, served in soup-like dishes containing pieces of mutton, beef or offal.

It is made from unleavened or leavened dough and usually filled with ground meat and chopped onion. Originally, finely chopped pre-cooked meat was used as a filling, but later raw ground meat became more common. Alternatively, peremech can be filled with potato or quark.Peremech is usually shaped into a flattened sphere with a circular \"window\" in the middle. In contrast to doughnuts, the hole does not go all the way through, but is only made at the top, such that the filling is visible in the middle. The shape is thus somewhat similar to Russian vatrushka. However, dough neatly kneaded around the hole gives the classical peremech its distinctive shape.Peremech is traditionally served with broth, qatiq (yogurt) or ayran.Nowadays, the meat-filled version is popular throughout Russia and other post-Soviet countries where it is usually referred to as belyash (Russian: \u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0448, pl. \u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0448\u0438, belyashi). This word appeared in Russian in the second half of the 20th century and possibly derives from another Tatar word, b\u0259le\u015f, which denotes a baked full-size pie with meat and potato filling. Modern variants of belyashi can also be made without a hole in the top. Along with pirozhki and chiburekki, belyashi are a common street food in the region.\nIn Finland, the pastry is known as p\u00e4r\u00e4m\u00e4tsi and first appeared in the 1960s in Tampere."

It is a type of batter bread. Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were probably eaten in prehistoric societies.The pancake's shape and structure varies worldwide. In the United Kingdom, pancakes are often unleavened and resemble a cr\u00eape. In North America, a leavening agent is used (typically baking powder) creating a thick fluffy pancake. A cr\u00eape is a thin pancake of Breton origin cooked on one or both sides in a special pan or crepe maker to achieve a lacelike network of fine bubbles. A well-known variation originating from southeast Europe is palatschinke, a thin moist pancake fried on both sides and filled with jam, cream cheese, chocolate, or ground walnuts, but many other fillings\u2014sweet or savoury\u2014can also be used.\nCommercially prepared pancake mixes are available in some countries. Like waffles, commercially prepared frozen pancakes are available from companies like Eggo. When buttermilk is used in place of or in addition to milk, the pancake develops a tart flavor and becomes known as a buttermilk pancake, which is common in Scotland, Ireland and the US. Buckwheat flour can be used in a pancake batter, making for a type of buckwheat pancake, a category that includes blini, kaletez, ploye, and memil-buchimgae. When potato is used as a major portion of the batter, the result is a potato pancake.  \nPancakes may be served at any time of the day or year with a variety of toppings or fillings, but they have developed associations with particular times and toppings in different regions. In North America, they are typically considered a breakfast food and serve a similar function to waffles.  In Britain and the Commonwealth, they are associated with Shrove Tuesday, commonly known as \"Pancake Day\", when, historically, perishable ingredients had to be used up before the fasting period of Lent."

(Shrove Tuesday is better known in the United States, France, and other countries as Mardi Gras or Fat Tuesday.) Historically, pancakes were made on Shrove Tuesday so that the last of the fat or lard was used up before Lent. No meat products should be eaten during Lent.\n\nCharity and school events are organized on Pancake Day: in a \"pancake race\" each participant carries a pancake in a frying pan. All runners must toss their pancakes as they run and catch them in the frying pan. This event is said to have originated in Olney, England in 1445 when a housewife was still busy frying pancakes to eat before the Lenten fast when she heard the bells of St Peter and St Paul's Church calling her to the Shriving Service. Eager to get to church, she ran out of her house still holding the frying pan complete with pancake, tossing it to prevent it from burning, and still wearing her apron and headscarf. Every Shrove Tuesday since 1950, the towns of Olney and Liberal, Kansas have competed in the International Pancake Race. Only local women may compete; they race, and their times are compared to determine the international winner. In Olney the main women's race is augmented by races for local schoolchildren and for men.\nThe Rehab UK Parliamentary Pancake Race takes place every Shrove Tuesday, with teams from the British lower house (the House of Commons), the upper house (the House of Lords), and the Fourth Estate, contending for the title of Parliamentary Pancake Race Champions. The fun relay race is to raise awareness of the work of the national brain injury charity, Rehab UK, and the needs of people with acquired brain injury."

It is the oldest surviving Indian restaurant in the United Kingdom. In its early years, Veeraswamy served Anglo-Indian cuisine, but in recent decades, based on the popularity of authentic Indian food in the UK, has served a menu of regional Indian cuisine, including dishes from Punjab, Lucknow, Kashmir, and Goa. Edward Palmer used the name E. P. Veeraswamy for his food business and the book; Veeraswamy was his grandmother's family name. Initially it was spelled Veerasawmy, it became Veeraswamy because of a printing error."

        "content": "Edward Palmer had considerable knowledge of Indian food, and lectured on the subject.  He founded E. P. Veeraswamy & Co. in Hornsey in 1896 to promote Indian foods \"so that they could be used under Western conditions and yet produce Eastern results\". He sold them under the trademark \u2018Nizam\u2019 an Indian noble title meaning viceroy.\nIn 1924 Palmer was engaged to advise the restaurant in the Indian Government Pavilion at the British Empire Exhibition in Wembley Park, Middlesex. Restaurants at the Exhibition were a monopoly of J. Lyons, but the Indian Government reserved the right to use Indian cooks.  They called in Palmer, \"of Messrs. Veeraswami [sic] & Co.\" to serve as \"Indian Adviser at the restaurant.\" This included providing some of the dishes served.\nIn 1924 the restaurant in the Indian Pavilion advertised itself thus: \"If you appreciate Indian foods take your lunch at the Indian Pavilion.\"\nThe official Indian Government report for the 1924 season says \"The Indian Restaurant with its curries drew large crowds, and at lunch and tea time on most days long queues formed up at the entrance.\" Of Palmer it says \"his selection [as adviser] was happy, and the success of the Indian cafe was largely due to him.  The Indian cafe was not only appreciated by Indian visitors to Wembley who were able to get their vegetarian food, but was very popular with the British public.\" In 1924 the restaurant served an average of 500 curries a day.\nFor reasons both economic and political the Government of India did not participate in the Exhibition in 1925. The Indian Pavilion was turned into an 'oriental bazaar' selling goods from throughout India and Burma. However, the restaurant was retained, and this time was entirely run by Veeraswamy & Co. In 1925 the restaurant could seat 200 people.Veeraswamy in Regent Street was not the first Indian restaurant in Britain, as the Hindoostane Coffee House in Marlebone had been opened by Sake Dean Mahomed in 1810, closing in 1812.  Nor was it the only one in 1926, but it was probably the first high-end one, and one of the first to cater to a largely European (though initially admittedly mostly ex-Indian Civil Service and Indian Army) clientele. It was certainly the first to cater to European royalty.\nThe restaurant was taken over by Sir William Steward in 1930. He was married to a singer and artist of the time Greta Gaye. Throughout the 1930s trade was very difficult but the couple used great resourcefulness and came through the challenging times. In 1915 Veeraswamy published a recipe book, Indian Cookery for Use in All Countries, which is still in print today. In the 1940s and 1950s the restaurant became a great success. The first ever curry in a can was introduced under Veeraswamy Food Products brand in the early 1950s. The restaurant was sold by Sir William in 1967. The food products business under the Veeraswamy name continued to be owned by the couple into the 1990s.\nThe restaurant decor was updated a number of times, and adopted an ultramodern theme in the late 1990s; however, for its 80th anniversary in 2006, it was redecorated in a 1920s motif. Veeraswamy is currently owned by the Chutney Mary group.The origins of lager drinking with Indian food may be related to Prince Axel of Denmark's visit to the Veeraswamy-connected Indian restaurant at the British Empire Exhibition on 2 May 1924. He enjoyed his meal and later visited the Regent Street restaurant, apparently bringing a barrel of Carlsberg with him. He enjoyed his meal again, and decided to send a barrel of Carlsberg (the Danish royal beer) to the restaurant every year thereafter. The beer proved popular, so the restaurant started importing Carlsberg, and when waiters left to found or work in other Indian restaurants, they served Carlsberg as well.Notable diners at Veeraswamy have included Winston Churchill, King Gustav VI of Sweden, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Charlie Chaplin and Ian Sinclair. Sir Abdul Qadir dined at the restaurant in February 1939, when the menu consisted of Mulligatawny Soup, Kashmiri fish, Chicken Madras and suji halva.Veeraswamy was acquired by Ranjit Mathrani and Namitha Panjabi in 1997.  They restored the decor, creating opulent interiors evoking 1920s maharajal palaces.\nIn 2016 Veeraswamy was awarded a Michelin star.  The Michelin Guide inspectors said that \"It may have opened in 1926 but this celebrated Indian restaurant just keeps getting better and better! The classic dishes from across the country are prepared with considerable care by a very professional kitchen. The room is awash with colour and it's run with great charm and enormous pride\"."

Joe's recipe for \"Texas-Style Chili Colorado\" was based on one his mother made during his childhood in Uvalde, Texas. His mother disliked short-cut cooking and instead used ground chilies and other seasonings. Joe used a similar method, and his recipe was considered one of Esparza's signature dishes. In 1994, Martha shared her recipe for \"Sudie Mae's Sweet Potato Pecan Pie\", which came from her mother, who would make it on Sundays while growing up in Mineola, Texas. Joe's \"Nopalito Ranchero\" recipe, which he shared with The Oregonian in 1996, became popular after guests \"got over their squeamishness over eating cactus leaves\". The recipe for \"Turkey Guiso a la Tex-Mex\" (guiso is a type of stew), was shared in 2002 and has been recommended for utilizing leftover Thanksgiving turkey. Esparza's \"Dirty Bird\" recipe was shared on the Food Network's The Best Of: Spicy Foods."

In 1992, Esparza's was named The Oregonian's \"Restaurant of the Year\". According to the paper, the restaurant played an important role in developing NE and SE 28th Avenue as a food destination. Portland Monthly called the food \"so-so\", but noted its menu, outdoor patio and jukebox, encouraging people to \"bask in the indecipherable harmonies of norte\u00f1o polka crackling from the vintage vinyl-and-neon Wurlitzer\".Esparza's was highlighted in numerous travel guides of Portland. Fodor's published, \"Be prepared for south-of-the-border craziness at this beloved local eatery. Wild West kitsch festoons the walls, but it isn't any wilder than some of the entr\u00e9es that emerge from chef-owner Joe Esparza's kitchen.\" In her book Insiders' Guide to Portland, Oregon, Rachel Dresbeck called the menu \"spicy, flavorful, and tantalizingly aromatic\", and described the atmosphere as \"1950s Texas soda shop\u2014just the right accent to complement the hearty fare\". Yahoo! Travel called the restaurant \"fun, wild and woolly\", offering food \"in the true tradition of the Lone Star State\". Yahoo! recommended the chile rellenos, ostrich enchiladas, or nopalito for a unique dining experience.\nThe restaurant did not receive universal acclaim, however. In a negative review for The Portland Mercury in 2000, Robin Rosenberg wrote: ... one expects the food at Esparza's to be something special; You might think that the line trickling out the door on a Thursday night is an indication of exceptional Tex-Mex, worth a considerable sum. Well, certainly, Esparza's d\u00e8cor, an amalgam of Western nostalgia, Texan brawn, and Tijuana cheese is executed with flair. Unfortunately though, no thematic coup can compensate for the fact that Esparza's food rarely exceeds mediocre, and never lives up to its price... The bulk of the clientele resides in a comfortable economic bracket and come down to the gritty Eastside to quaff top shelf margaritas and feast on manic kitsch. The hot corn chips and fresh salsa, which come fast and free, are the height of the meal. Smoked salmon enchiladas are just wrong; No quantity of barbecue sauce (in this case, cloying and acrid) is going to improve a tough, dry brisket. The pork tacos are equally dry, but the ground buffalo enchiladas are very macho and spicy (though they will linger painfully)... The beans and rice that accompany most entrees are utterly flavorless, a gratuitous use of space on the plate. Some people like beans and rice; Esparza's doesn't seem to care. It's a troublesome adage, 'you get what you pay for,' when you've gorged on flash and formula\u2014and yet, you're starved for a good meal.\nFollowing the restaurant's closure, The Oregonian's Grant Butler called the run that it had \"remarkable\". He recalled, \"[W]hen Esparza's opened in 1990, it broke the mold of what Mexican fare in Portland could be. Instead of combination plates blanketed in shrouds of sour cream and melted cheddar, Esparza's served dishes that few people in Portlanders [sic] had ever experienced at the time\"."

According to French law, foie gras is defined as the liver of a duck or goose fattened by gavage (force feeding).\nFoie gras is a popular and well-known delicacy in French cuisine. Its flavour is rich, buttery, and delicate, unlike an ordinary duck or goose liver. Foie gras is sold whole or is prepared as mousse, parfait, or p\u00e2t\u00e9, and may also be served as an accompaniment to another food item, such as steak. French law states, \"Foie gras belongs to the protected cultural and gastronomical heritage of France.\"The technique of gavage dates as far back as 2500 BC, when the ancient Egyptians began keeping birds for food and deliberately fattened the birds through force-feeding. Today, France is by far the largest producer and consumer of foie gras, though there are producers and markets worldwide, particularly in other European nations, the United States, and China.Gavage-based foie gras production is controversial, due mainly to animal welfare concerns about force-feeding, intensive housing and husbandry, and enlarging the liver to 10 times its usual volume. A number of countries and jurisdictions have laws against force-feeding and the production, import, or sale of foie gras."

In the US, raw foie gras is classified as Grade A, B or C. Grade A is typically the highest in fat and especially suited for low-temperature preparation because the veins are relatively few and the resulting terrine will be more aesthetically appealing because it displays little blood. Grade B is accepted for higher temperature preparation because the higher proportion of protein gives the liver more structure after being seared.

The footage showed workers forcefully pushing tubes down ducks' throats. One worker said of the force-feeding process: \"Sometimes the duck doesn't get up, and it dies. There have been times that 20 ducks were killed.\" Hudson Valley operations manager Marcus Henley replied that the farm's mortality statistics are not above average for the poultry industry. Because Hudson Valley provides foie gras to Amazon.com, Mercy for Animals began a campaign urging Amazon to stop selling foie gras, a move that has already been made by Costco, Safeway, and Target.In November 2013, the Daily Mirror published a report based on the video they obtained depicting cruelty towards ducks in a farm owned by French firm Ernest Soulard, which is a supplier to celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay's restaurants.

They described the food's heritage as deriving from \"the middle of Italy, the Romagna-Lazio region, rich in seafood.\"  (According to the restaurant's website, Provino Mosca came from San Benedetto del Tronto, a coastal city on the Adriatic Sea in the Marche region of central Italy.)\nIn her New Orleans food memoir Gumbo Tales, Sara Roahen says, \"Mosca's is just the sort of family-run restaurant that New Orleanians tend to covet: it's creaky, set in its ways, and no picnic to find.\"In an edition of Roadfood written after Hurricane Katrina, Jane and Michael Stern comment that the restaurant seems unchanged since its reopening.  They ask the rhetorical question, \"can this two-room joint with the blaring jukebox really be the most famous Creole roadhouse in America?\"; then they describe the experience as a \"culinary epiphany\", and say that \"roadside food gets no better, or more garlicky, or heartier, than this.\"Calvin Trillin, in a November 2010 article about the restaurant in The New Yorker, also remarks on its seemingly unchanged nature since 1946. He recounts that the Mosca family had once considered moving the restaurant to a more convenient location, but the idea had met substantial resistance from their mostly local customer base.Reviews of the restaurant often note that almost every party orders more or less the same items from Mosca's relatively short menu, served family-style in very large portions.  These popular dishes include:\n\nOysters Mosca (also called Oysters Italian Style), which the Sterns call \"a festival of garlic, olive oil, Parmesan cheese, and bread crumbs\").\nShrimp Mosca (also called Shrimp Italian Style), summarized by local food critic Tom Fitzmorris as \"enormous, whole, unpeeled, with olive oil and tons of garlic\".\nMarinated crab, served as a salad or in the shell.\nChicken a la Grande, a simple dish cooked in a skillet with (in Trillin's words) \"only salt and pepper, rosemary, oregano, white wine, and, of course, ten cloves (or is it heads?) of garlic\".\nSpaghetti bordelaise, described by the Collins as \"perfect homemade pasta and a remarkable, perfectly balanced oil and garlic sauce\", and which Roahen calls \"as much butter, oil, and garlic as your body can process without suffering a systematic failure.\"\nPineapple fluff for dessert, which the Collins called \"a bit of delicious New Orleans kitsch.\""

The term seksu is attested in various Berber dialects such as Kabyle and Rifain, while Saharan Berber dialects such as Touareg and Ghadames have a slightly different form, keskesu. This widespread geographical dispersion of the term strongly suggests its local Berber origin, lending further support to its likely Berber roots as Algerian linguist Salem Chaker suggests.The Berber root *KS means \"well formed, well rolled, rounded.\" Numerous names and pronunciations for couscous exist around the world.:\u200a919"

        "content": "It is unclear when couscous originated. Food historian Lucie Bolens believes couscous originated millennia ago, during the reign of Masinissa in the ancient kingdom of Numidia in present-day Algeria. Traces of cooking vessels akin to couscoussiers have been found in graves from the 3rd century BC, from the time of the berber kings of Numidia, in the city of Tiaret, Algeria. Couscoussiers dating back to the 12th century were found in the ruins of Igiliz, located in the Sous valley of Morocco.According to food writer Charles Perry, couscous originated among the Berbers of Algeria and Morocco between the end of the 11th-century Zirid dynasty, modern-day Algeria, and the rise of the 13th-century Almohad Caliphate. The historian Hady Idris noted that couscous is attested to during the Hafsid dynasty, but not the Zirid dynasty.In the 12th century, Maghrebi cooks were preparing dishes of non-mushy grains by stirring flour with water to create light, round balls of couscous dough that could be steamed.The historian Maxime Rodinson found three recipes for couscous from the 13th century Arabic cookbook Kitab al-Wusla ila al-Habib, written by an Ayyubid author, and the anonymous Arabic cooking book Kitab al tabikh and Ibn Razin al-Tujibi's Fadalat al-khiwan also contain recipes.Couscous is believed to have been spread among the inhabitants of the Iberian Peninsula by the Berber dynasties of the 13th century, though it is no longer found in traditional Spanish or Portuguese cuisine. In modern day Trapani, Sicily, the dish is still made to the medieval recipe of Andalusian author Ibn Razin al-Tujibi. Ligurian families that moved from Tabarka to Sardinia brought the dish with them to Carloforte in the 18th century.Known in France since the 16th century, it was brought into French cuisine at the beginning of the 20th century via the French colonial empire and the Pieds-Noirs."

        "content": "Couscous is traditionally made from semolina, the hardest part of the grain of durum wheat (the hardest of all forms of wheat), which resists the grinding of the millstone. The semolina is sprinkled with water and rolled with the hands to form small pellets, sprinkled with dry flour to keep them separate, and then sieved. Any pellets that are too small to be finished, granules of couscous fall through the sieve and are again rolled and sprinkled with dry semolina and rolled into pellets. This labor-intensive process continues until all the semolina has been formed into tiny couscous granules. In the traditional method of preparing couscous, groups of people come together to make large batches over several days, which are then dried in the sun and used for several months. Handmade couscous may need to be rehydrated as it is prepared; this is achieved by a process of moistening and steaming over stew until the couscous reaches the desired light and fluffy consistency.In some regions, couscous is made from farina or coarsely ground barley or pearl millet.\n\nIn modern times, couscous production is largely mechanized, and the product is sold worldwide. This couscous can be sauteed before it is cooked in water or another liquid. Properly cooked couscous is light and fluffy, not gummy or gritty.\nTraditionally, North Africans use a food steamer (called a taseksut in the Berber language, a \u0643\u0650\u0633\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0633 kiskas in  Arabic or a couscoussier in  French language). The base is a tall metal pot shaped like an oil jar, where the meat and vegetables are cooked as a stew. On top of the base, a steamer sits where the couscous is cooked, absorbing the flavours from the stew. The steamer's lid has holes around its edge so steam can escape. It is also possible to use a pot with a steamer insert. If the holes are too big, the steamer can be lined with damp cheesecloth.\nThe couscous that is sold in most Western grocery stores is usually pre-steamed and dried. It is typically prepared by adding 1.5 measures of boiling water or stock to each measure of couscous and then leaving it covered tightly for about five minutes. Pre-steamed couscous takes less time to prepare than regular couscous, most dried pasta, or dried grains (such as rice). Packaged sets of quick-preparation couscous and canned vegetables, and generally meat, are routinely sold in European grocery stores and supermarkets. Couscous is widely consumed in France, where it was introduced by Maghreb immigrants and voted the third most popular dish in a 2011 survey."

Couscous and pasta have similar nutritional value, although pasta is usually more refined.Several dishes worldwide are also made from granules, like those of couscous rolled from flour from grains or other milled or grated starchy crops.\n\nAtti\u00e9k\u00e9, a staple food in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and surrounding regions of West Africa, is made from granulated grated cassava.\nCuscuz (Portuguese pronunciation: [kus\u02c8kus]) is a couscous-like dish from the Northeast Region of Brazil.

It may be made from semolina for special occasions but is often made with rice, millet, or other grain. Moringa leaves are traditionally included in the dish. In France, this Nigerien dish has been adapted as a specific variant (called couscous aux \u00e9pinards) of the Maghreb-syle couscous commonly found there, often using spinach in place of the moringa.\nFregula is a type of pasta from Sardinia. It is similar to North African Berkoukes and Middle Eastern Moghrabieh. Fregula comes in varying sizes but typically consists of semolina dough rolled into balls 2\u20133 mm in diameter and toasted in an oven.\nKouskousaki (\u039a\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9 (in Greek) or kuskus (in  Turkish) is a pasta from Greece and Turkey, that is boiled and served with cheese and walnuts.In the Levant, the dish known as moghrabieh (a reference to the Maghreb region) uses the same durum-based semolina flour but rolled into larger (5\u20136 millimetres (0.20\u20130.24 in) in diameter) 'pearls' to create a dish that is popular across Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. The pearls are either cooked as part of a stew or flavored with cinnamon and served alongside a chicken and chickpea broth.\nPalestinian maftoul uses granules that are larger than the North African variety but smaller than moghrabieh pearls (2\u20133 millimetres (0.079\u20130.118 in) in diameter) and made with bulgur, not durum wheat. It is similarly served alongside a chicken and chickpea broth. \"Maftoul\" is an Arabic word derived from the root \"fa-ta-la,\" which means to roll or to twist, describing the hand-rolling method used to make the granules.\nIsraeli couscous, known in Hebrew as ptitim (Hebrew: \u05e4\u05b0\u05bc\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd\u200e, p'tit\u00edm, lit.

Selections would vary, depending on available stock and season.Looking back on when he purchased Father's Office in the late '80s, Moench said embracing craft beer came with a cost. \"When I stopped selling Bud and put Widmer Hefeweizen on that tap handle, I got a reaction. I had to educate people.\"Father's Office made headlines in 1991 when Moench decided to voluntarily make it California's first smoke-free bar. For Moench, taking action was a health issue for his employees. \"Secondhand smoke kills some 53,000 people each year,\u201d Moench would tell bar owners. \"This is about caring for the health of your employees and customers who don't smoke,\" he said. Seven years later, all other bar owners in California would eventually join him. In 1994, Gov. Pete Wilson signed a law banning smoking in the workplace. A temporary exemption was carved out for bars and casinos, but that ended on January 1, 1998.Father's Office was purchased in 2000 by owner and head chef Sang Yoon, who had cooked gourmet California cuisine at Michael's restaurant in Santa Monica, California. Yoon opened the bar's kitchen which had previously offered cheese plates and a list of local delivery options for patrons to bring in. The main attraction was the Office Burger, a patty of fine dry-aged beef topped with caramelized onions, Gruy\u00e8re and Maytag cheeses, applewood-smoked bacon compote and arugula served on a soft roll.Sang Yoon is infamous for allowing no substitutions or alterations of any type to the food served at Father's Office, including no ketchup.A second Father's Office location in the Helms Bakery building in Los Angeles, California was opened in April 2008."

The full name of the prepared spread in Arabic is \u1e25ummu\u1e63 bi \u1e6da\u1e25\u012bna 'chickpeas with tahini'. The colloquial Arabic word \u1e25ummu\u1e63 is a variant of the Arabic \u1e25imma\u1e63 or \u1e25immi\u1e63 which may be derived from the Aramaic language (\u05d7\u05de\u05e6\u05d9 \u1e25em\u1e63\u012bn, \u1e25em\u1e63\u0101y), corresponding to the Syriac word for chickpeas: \u1e25em(m)\u1e63\u0113. The word entered the English language around the mid-20th century from the Arabic \u1e25ummu\u1e63 or via its borrowing for the name of the dish in Turkish: humus.

Some American dictionaries give hommos as an alternative, while British dictionaries give houmous or hoummos.The major British supermarkets use houmous.Other spellings include homous, houmos, houmus, and similar variants. While humus (as it is spelled in Turkish) is sometimes found, it is avoided as a heteronym of humus, organic matter in soil."

All of the ingredients in hummus are easily found in gardens, farms and markets, thus adding to the availability and popularity of the dish. Hummus is usually garnished, with olive oil, \"nana\" mint leaves, paprika, and parsley.Hummus is a common part of everyday meals in Israel. It is made from ingredients that, following Kashrut (Jewish dietary laws), can be combined with both meat and dairy meals. Chickpea dishes have long been part of the cuisine of Jews who lived in the Middle East and Northern Africa. The many Mizrahi Jewish immigrants from these countries brought their own unique variations, such as hummus with fried eggplant and boiled eggs prepared by Iraqi Jews. For example, the Yemenite quarter of Tel Aviv is known for its hummus with traditional skhug hot sauce. Israeli versions use large amounts of tahini for a creamier texture. According to Peli-Bronshtein \"Israelis also added a hard-boiled egg next to the hummus. And the large quantities of tahini that are part of the hummus these days also are an Israeli thing.\" Many restaurants, called hummusia, run by Mizrahi Jews and Arabs are dedicated to warm hummus. Those restaurants are largely \"male territory\". It may be served as chick peas softened with baking soda along with garlic, olive oil, cumin and tahini. One of the hummus versions available is msabbaha, made with lemon-spiked tahini garnished with whole chick peas, a sprinkling of paprika and a drizzle of olive oil. Other versions, includes the foul, made with stewed fava beans, the pitryot made with mushrooms or the Jerusalem made with spiced ground beef and pine nuts.One author calls hummus, \"One of the most popular and best-known of all Syrian dishes\" and a \"must on any mezzeh table.\" Syrian and Lebanese in Canada's Arab diaspora prepare and consume hummus along with other dishes like falafel, kibbeh and tabbouleh, even among the third- and fourth-generation offspring of the original immigrants.In Cyprus, hummus is part of the local cuisine in both Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities where it is called \"humoi\" (Greek: \u03c7\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9). In the United Kingdom, hummus was popularized by Greek Cypriot caterers, sometimes leading to a perception of it being a Greek food.In Turkey, hummus is considered a meze.In France, in the region of Provence, there is a dish called poichichade that resembles hummus.In the United States and Europe, hummus is commercially available in numerous traditional and non-traditional varieties, such as beet or chocolate."

According to Ofra Tene and Dafna Hirsch, the dispute over ownership of hummus, exposes nationalism through food and the important role played by the industrialization of hummus made by Israeli private companies in 1958. Although, hummus has traditionally been part of the cuisine of the Mizrahi Jews who lived in Arabic-speaking lands, the dish was also popularized among the Jewish immigrants from Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century. Historian Dafna Hirsch describes its adoption in their diet as part of an attempt of blending in the Middle Eastern environment, while sociologist Rafi Grosglick points out the importance of its health aspects to their diet. In recent years, through a process of gourmetization, the Arab identity of hummus became a marker of its authenticity, making famous Arab-Israeli villages such as Abu Gosh and Kafr Yasif. Hence, enthusiasts travel to the more remote Arab and Druze villages in the northern Galilee region in search of culinary experiences.In October 2008, the Association of Lebanese Industrialists petitioned to the Lebanese Ministry of Economy and Trade to request protected status from the European Commission for hummus as a uniquely Lebanese food, similar to the Protected Geographical Status rights held over regional food items by various European Union countries. As of 2009, the Lebanese Industrialists Association was still \"collecting documents and proof\" to support its claim.The 2005 short film West Bank Story features a rivalry between two fictional restaurants, the Israeli \"Kosher King\" and the Palestinian \"Hummus Hut\". A parody of West Side Story, the film won the 2006 Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. In 2012, Australian filmmaker Trevor Graham released a documentary, Make Hummus Not War, on the political and gastronomic aspects of hummus.Lebanon and Israel's chefs have been engaged in a competition over the largest dish of hummus, as validated by the Guinness World Record, as a form of contestation of \"ownership\". The \"title\" has gone back and forth between Israel (2008), Lebanon (2009), Israel (January 2010), and, as of 2021, Lebanon (May 2010). The winning dish, cooked by 300 cooks in the village of al-Fanar, near Beirut, weighed approximately 10,450 kilograms (23,040 lb), more than double the weight of the Israeli-Arab previous record. According to local media, the recipe included eight tons of boiled chick peas, two tonnes of tahini, two tonnes of lemon juice, and 70 kilograms (150 lb) of olive oil."

The original Park Avenue location featured a butcher shop that specialized in French cuts of meat.  The Park Avenue location was featured prominently in the book Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain, who also detailed many of Les Halles' recipes in Anthony Bourdain's Les Halles Cookbook. The Downtown New York branch occupied the site of the former John Street Theatre, \"Birthplace of American Theatre.\"The Park Avenue location of Les Halles closed in March 2016. The Washington, D.C. location of Les Halles closed in mid-November 2008 following a fifteen-year run. Owner Philippe Lajaunie cited difficulty obtaining a new lease as the reason. The Miami location is now closed as well. In its 2013 user poll, Zagat gave its two New York restaurants each a food rating of 21 out of 30.In 2018, Les Halles, though closed down, became a memorial to Anthony Bourdain after his suicide.In March 2022, a new French-style restaurant named La Brasserie opened in the former Les Halles space on \nPark Avenue.  La Brasserie owner Francis Staub, previously the founder of Staub cookware, expressed his intent to continue the Brasserie Les Halles philosophy. Some iconic dishes by Anthony Bourdain, such as the Steak Frites, are kept on the menu as an homage. La Brasserie was rebranded as 'Chez Francis' in April 2023."

        "content": "A thin cr\u00eape-like confection called funoyaki may be an early precursor to okonomiyaki. Records of the word funoyaki appear as far back as the 16th century, as written about by tea master Sen no Riky\u016b, and though the dish's ingredients are unclear, it may have included fu (wheat gluten). By the late Edo period (1603\u20131867), funoyaki referred to a thin cr\u00eape baked on a cooking pot, with miso basted on one side. This confection is the ancestor of the modern confections kintsuba (\u91d1\u3064\u3070), which is also called gintsuba (\u9280\u3064\u3070) in Kyoto and Osaka, and taiko-yaki (also known as imagawayaki), which both use nerian (\u7df4\u308a\u9921), a sweet bean paste.In the Meiji era (1868\u20131912), monjiyaki (\u6587\u5b57\u713c\u304d), a related confection, was popular with children at dagashiya (\u99c4\u83d3\u5b50\u5c4b), shops selling cheap sweets. This was made by drawing letters (monji) or pictures with flour batter on a teppan (iron griddle) and adding ingredients of choice. The confectionary was also called dondonyaki (\u3069\u3093\u3069\u3093\u713c\u304d), from the onomatopoeia of the stall sellers beating drums to attract customers.The first appearance of the word \"okonomiyaki\" was at a shop in Osaka in the 1930s. After the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake when people lacked amenities, it became a pastime to cook these cr\u00eapes, and after World War II (when there was a short supply of rice) okonomiyaki emerged as an inexpensive and filling dish for all ages, often with savory toppings, such as meat, seafood, and vegetables. This \"okonomiyaki boom\" saw household equipment and ingredients for the dish become commercially available. Monjiyaki also developed into the related modern dish monjayaki (\u30e2\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u713c\u304d), which has a more runny batter due to more added water, resulting in a different cooked consistency.The issen y\u014dshoku (cheap Western-style cuisine) of Kyoto, which developed in the Taish\u014d period (1912\u20131926), may have produced an early form of modern savory okonomiyaki in the form of a pancake with Worcestershire sauce and chopped scallion."

An 1879 dictionary mentions a dish called latte inglese (lit.\u2009'English milk'), made of cream cooked with gelatin and molded, though other sources say that latte inglese is made with egg yolks, like cr\u00e8me anglaise; perhaps the name covered any thickened custard-like preparation.\nThe dish might also come from the French recipe of fromage bavarois from Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame in le p\u00e2tissier royal parisien, which is the same as the modern panna cotta, except that one part of the cream is whipped to make chantilly and included in the preparation before adding the gelatin.The Piedmont region includes panna cotta in its 2001 list of traditional food products. Its recipe includes cream, milk, sugar, vanilla, gelatin, rum, and marsala poured into a mold with caramel. Another author considers the traditional flavoring to be peach eau de vie, and the traditional presentation not to have sauce or other garnishes.Panna cotta became fashionable in the United States in the 1990s."

The molds may have caramel in the bottoms, giving a result similar to a cr\u00e8me caramel. After it solidifies, the panna cotta is usually unmolded onto a serving plate.\nAlthough the name means 'cooked cream', the ingredients are only warm enough to dissolve the gelatin and sugar.

Cubes of corned beef, potatoes, onions and green bell peppers are joined by a delicious outside not found in most dishes citywide: Cheese. Where some hashes fall flat in the flavor or interest department, the hash here shines thanks in part to our cheesy friend.

In December 2014, the Golden Ox announced permanent closure before the end of the year. Landlord Bill Haw indicated that the Golden Ox was behind on rent, and Haw planned to pursue a different restaurant or entertainment concept for the restaurant space in the livestock exchange building.\nFollowing the 2014 closing of the restaurant, the space was divided, and Stockyards Brewing Co. planned to open in the south portion of the space, which was previously the bar area and one of the back dining areas.

By 1981, Le Bec-Fin was known as the leader of the \"Philadelphia restaurant revolution.\" The restaurant moved to its final location at 1523 Walnut Street in 1983. Esquire described it as the best French restaurant in America and a 1994 Cond\u00e9 Nast reader's poll ranked it as the best restaurant in the country.\nThe Le Bec-Fin signature crab cake recipe can be found online, and is also featured in Georges Perrier's 1997 book, titled Le Bec-Fin Recipes. Perrier's cuisine favors traditional French ingredients with high-quality produce from throughout the world. The wine list favored selections from the borders of France and some standouts from the new world.\nPerrier made extensive changes to the restaurant after the Mobil Travel Guide reduced it to 4-star status in the 2001 Mobil Travel Guide.  The interior was remodeled, the wine list expanded, and Perrier relinquished command of his restaurant to the head chef.  Perrier said to his staff, \"Change everything but the chandeliers.\"  In the 2003 guide, the fifth star was restored.\nOn April 4, 2008, Le Bec-Fin gave up its 5-star rating in favor of a more relaxed atmosphere. This loss dropped the number of American 5-star restaurants to 16. The change to a more relaxed atmosphere included \u00e0 la carte dining as opposed to a fixed price menu with a strict seating schedule.In January 2009, the French government awarded Perrier the Legion d'Honneur.Although he denied it at first, Georges Perrier put the building up for sale in 2010. During a dinner at the restaurant several months later, however, he announced that he would keep the restaurant open indefinitely. Prompted by an unfavorable review, Perrier announced his retirement in February 2012 and sold Le Bec-Fin to one of its former managers, Nicolas Fanucci, who re-opened the restaurant in June 2012 after remodeling and making minor adjustments. Master chef Walter Abrams, formerly of the restaurant French Laundry, led the kitchen, stressing locally-grown ingredients and fresh produce.Upon hearing of the restaurant's closure, filmmaker Erika Frankel began making a documentary on Perrier and his restaurant. Entitled King Georges, the film premiered in April 2015 at a film festival.Le Bec-Fin closed after dinner service on June 15, 2013. The space then housed Chef Justin Bogle's progressive American restaurant Avance, which closed October 11, 2014 after 10 months."

During this time, Charles Masson Sr., co-founder of New York City's famed restaurant La Grenouille had worked under Henri Soul\u00e9 in Le Pavillon. When World War II began, Soul\u00e9 and the Pavillon chef Pierre Franey stayed in the United States as war refugees.\nThe restaurant formally opened on October 15, 1941, at 5 East 55th Street on Fifth Avenue, across the street from the St. Regis New York. In 1957, Le Pavillon moved to the Ritz Tower on Park Avenue and 57th Street. Soul\u00e9 died in 1966, and Le Pavillon closed in 1971.In his autobiography, Jacques P\u00e9pin describes how he was first employed at Le Pavilion after emigrating to the US in 1959. He found that Franey and the rest of the staff were underpaid and treated poorly by Soul\u00e9, who insisted that he was barely making ends meet, even though he would offer complimentary meals and wine to a large number of celebrity guests. When P\u00e9pin and others organized a protest, he found himself physically threatened by organized-crime goons. However, there was soon an exodus of the staff (Franey and P\u00e9pin moved to Howard Johnson's) and the restaurant never recovered. Soul\u00e9's other faux pas was allowing paparazzi to disturb the Kennedy family (who were regular customers) and their staffers during John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign: when the Kennedy team, which was dining at the restaurant, asked the paparazzi to leave, Soul\u00e9 insisted that only he had the right, as owner, to determine who entered and left the restaurant, and stated that, even before the election, \"the Kennedys already think they are running the country.\" (P\u00e9pin was offered the job of White House chef after the election, but declined.)\nDaniel Boulud opened a restaurant with the same name in 2021, in homage to Soul\u00e9's restaurant."

These were usually hot zakuski (appetizers) or breakfast dishes. A Gift to Young Housewives, a classical Russian cookbook by Elena Molokhovets, provides three recipes of hot vorschmack in its first edition (1861) and further variants were added in subsequent editions.

Other recipes include only herring (without meat), as well as other ingredients, such as potatoes, eggs and apples.

The dish is usually garnished with potatoes, pickles and smetana (sour cream). Snaps is usually served in combination with eating vorschmack. Some recipes include cognac.There are several stories regarding the origin of the dish, but it has become a traditional Finnish dish as it was one of the favourite appetizers of the Finnish president, statesman, war hero and gourmand Marshall Gustaf Mannerheim. Some sources say Mannerheim brought the dish to Finland from Poland or Russia, but there have not been any definite sources for these claims.\nThe restaurant Savoy at the top floor of one of the buildings around the Esplanadi in central Helsinki is famous for its vorschmack. The restaurant used to be frequented by Mannerheim and Mannerheim's table at the Savoy was always reserved and, out of respect, no one would ever consider demanding to be seated there. Savoy still today keeps a similar style decor and menu as in the days of Mannerheim."

It is based on a well-known Hainanese dish called Wenchang chicken (\u6587\u660c\u96de), which is one of four important Hainan dishes dating to the Qing dynasty. The original dish was adapted by the Hainanese overseas Chinese population in the Nanyang area (present-day Southeast Asia). The Hainanese in China traditionally used a specific breed, the Wenchang chicken, to make the dish. They would usually cook rice with the leftover chicken stock to create a dish known as \"Wenchang chicken rice\". Wenchang chicken rice remained a dish for special occasions in Hainanese homes in Singapore until the 1940s.There is a shared culture of seasoned rice dishes across Hainan and the Leizhou peninsula. Wenchang chicken rice is closely related to another chicken rice dish known as Anpu chicken rice from Zhanjiang in western Guangdong province, and Anpu chicken rice is speculated to be the predecessor to Wenchang chicken rice. The city of Zhanjiang is also known for its wild betel rice (\u86e4\u848c\u996d) and duck rice (\u9e2d\u4ed4\u996d).Almost every country in Asia with a history of immigration from China has a version of Hainanese chicken rice. The San Francisco Chronicle says, \"the dish maps 150 years\u2019 immigration from China's Hainan Island...to Singapore and Malaysia, where the dish is often known as Hainan chicken rice; to Vietnam, where it is called \"Hai Nam chicken\"; and to Thailand, where it has been renamed \"khao man gai\" (\"chicken fat rice\").\""

The attempt, made by the World Association of Chinese Cuisine resulted in 4,192 kilograms (9,242 lb) of Yangzhou fried rice being produced by a team of 300 cooks. The organizers initially planned to send the end product to five companies for consumption by their staff. However, about 150 kilograms (330 lb) of it ended up as pig swill, as it had been cooked for four hours and was felt unsuitable for human consumption. As per the organizers' intents, the rest was sent to local canteens. However, due to a part of it being sent to feed animals, the world record attempt was disqualified, as a Guinness World Records spokesman said that it had become obvious that the dish was not fit for human consumption."

This larger venue, seating over 100, continued to attract both black and white nightclub guests and was also popular with black hotel employees leaving their shifts. Washington's children and grandchildren all worked in the restaurant from a young age, and those who married into the family were also put to work.\nWith the commercial downturn in Atlantic City in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Wash's relocated to 128 N.

In 2005, the red tide was quite severe, leading to lower supplies and price increases. Woodman's was forced to import clams from Canada."

The reason was probably that the lack of major salt deposits in the area favored the drying process for the preservation of whitefish, a process known for millennia.Stockfish is very nutrient-rich and was consumed domestically, although it was during the boom in the stockfish trade in the late Middle Ages that it became accessible throughout Scandinavia as well as the rest of Europe. Higher-quality stockfish would be soaked in water, then boiled and eaten with melted butter. Lower-quality fish would be harder and require longer boiling, using more fuel; it has been suggested that adding ash from beech or birch to the boiling water would break down the protein chains and speed up the process. The introduction of lye in the preparation process might therefore have been incidental."

The salt must be rinsed off before cooking.\nLutefisk does not need additional water for cooking; it is sufficient to place it in a pan, salt it, seal the lid tightly, and let it steam on a very low heat for 20\u201325 minutes. An alternative is to wrap it aluminium foil and bake at 225 \u00b0C (435 \u00b0F) for 40\u201350 minutes. Another option is to parboil lutefisk, wrapped in cheesecloth, until tender. Lutefisk can also be boiled in water, or cooked in a microwave oven. The typical microwave cooking time for a whole fish, supplied as a package of two sides, is 8 to 10 minutes at high power in a covered dish, depending upon oven power."

The remaining fish soaked in a puddle of rainwater and birch ash for months before some hungry Vikings discovered the cod, reconstituted it and had a feast.\nThere are many jokes about lutefisk, some printed on T-shirts, bumper stickers, and coffee mugs, e.g. \"Legalize lutefisk\" or \"I have tried lutefisk twice, once going down, and another time coming back up\".\nThe Season 3 King of the Hill episode \"Revenge of the Lutefisk\" features a plot where a new minister, Karen Stroup (Mary Tyler Moore), brings a dish of lutefisk to church to share a \"Minnesotan tradition\" in Texas. Bobby Hill secretly eats all the lutefisk, then has bad diarrhea in the church bathroom the next morning.

Ninfa Laurenzo drew inspiration from the cooking of her mother, who was a Mexican, and from Laurenzo's own travels to Mexico City. The food had an Italian influence because Laurenzo's deceased husband, Domenic Thomas Laurenzo, was an Italian American. Mozzarella, olive oil, and parmesan were used as ingredients.The signature dish was \"tacos al carbon,\" which later became called \"fajitas.\" The Ninfa's fajitas included chopped, char-grilled beef fillets placed in handmade flour tortillas. Ninfa's used a smoky marinade in the beef fajitas. The restaurant popularized fajitas in the Houston area. This dish was so influential that, by 2001, just about all Tex-Mex restaurants in Houston served a version of the Ninfa's fajitas.\nThe second most popular dish was the \"Green Sauce,\" an avocado and tomatillo sauce. When a customer had asked for \"salsa verde,\" Ninfa Laurenzo created the \"Green Sauce\" at the spur of the moment. Ninfa Laurenzo's son Roland later offered a modified version of this dish at his own restaurant, using pureed avocados, tomatillos, cilantro, garlic, and jalape\u00f1os. Patricia Sharpe of Texas Monthly said that Roland's version was a \"creamier, more luxurious potion\" than his mother's original recipe. Ninfa's also offered stuffed jalape\u00f1os. The stuffed jalape\u00f1os became a menu item at Tony Mandola's Gulf Coast Kitchen, operated by Phyllis Laurenzo Mandola, one of Ninfa Laurenzo's daughters, and her husband Tony.In 2004 Sharpe said that, at the original Ninfa's, the beef fajitas \"still have their old magic\" and that the flour tortillas, still made to order in-house, \"are truly carb-addictive.\" She said that the chicken fajitas \"have lost their luster.\" After Neil Morgan took over the chain in 2006, chef Alex Padilla added some new menu items including crab cakes with poblano sauce and Spanish lobster in tequila butter sauce. Padilla also said that the restaurant would grind its own beef brisket for its crispy tacos and use fresh tomatillo in the green sauce.The original Ninfa's includes several torta sandwiches, including the fajita burger, which consistently is positively reviewed. By July 2012 the restaurant introduced three new tortas, Al Pastor, Chicken Adobo, and Puerca (Pork)."

Eliot, Mortimer Wheeler, Aneurin Bevan, Barbara Castle, Ian Mikardo and Michael Foot.The restaurant is named in honour of the elite Hussars of the Hungarian army. The name is also associated with the name of a popular Hungarian operetta, The Gay Hussars, by Emmerich K\u00e1lm\u00e1n.\nIn October 2013, it was made known that owners Corus Hotels would put the Gay Hussar up for sale. A group of journalists, politicians and lawyers formed the \"Goulash Co-operative Ltd\" to raise money to secure the eight-year lease, but its bid was rejected by Corus. The restaurant closed in June 2018.In 2020, a restaurant called \"Noble Rot Soho\" opened on the site."

Jiaozi typically consist of a ground meat and/or vegetable filling wrapped into a thinly rolled piece of dough, which is then sealed by pressing the edges together. Finished jiaozi can be boiled (shu\u01d0 ji\u01ceo), steamed (zh\u0113ng ji\u01ceo), pan fried (ji\u0101n ji\u01ceo), or deep fried (zh\u00e1 ji\u01ceo), and are traditionally served with a black vinegar and sesame oil dip. They can also be served in a soup (t\u0101ng ji\u01ceo).\nJiaozi have great cultural significance attached to them within China. Jiaozi are one of the major dishes eaten during the Chinese New Year throughout northern China and eaten all year round in the northern provinces. Their resemblance to the gold and silver ingots (sycee) used in Imperial China has meant that they symbolize wealth and good fortune. Though considered part of Chinese cuisine, jiaozi are also popular in other parts of East Asia, where a Japanese variety is referred to as gyoza, and in the Western world, where a fried variety is referred to as potstickers. The English-language term \"potsticker\" was invented by Buwei Yang Chao in her book How to Cook and Eat in Chinese (1945)."

        "content": "In China, several folk stories explain the origin of jiaozi and its name.\nTraditionally, jiaozi were thought to be invented during the era of the Eastern Han (AD 25\u2013220) by Zhang Zhongjing who was a great practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine. Jiaozi were originally referred to as \"tender ears\" (Chinese: \u5b0c\u8033; pinyin: jiao'er) because they were used to treat frostbitten ears. Zhang Zhongjing was on his way home during wintertime when he saw that many common people had frostbitten ears, because they did not have warm clothes and sufficient food. He treated these poor people by stewing lamb, black pepper, and some warming medicines in a pot, chopped them, and used them to fill small dough wrappers. He boiled these dumplings and gave them with the broth to his patients, until the coming of the Chinese New Year. In order to celebrate the New Year as well as recovering from frostbitten ears, people imitated Zhang's recipe to make tender ears.Other theories suggest that jiaozi may have derived from dumplings in Western Asia. In the Western Han dynasty (206 BC \u2013 AD 9) jiaozi (\u9903\u5b50) were called jiaozi (\u89d2\u5b50). During the Three Kingdoms period (AD 220\u2013280), the book Guangya by Zhang Yi mentions jiaozi. Yan Zhitui during the Northern Qi dynasty (AD 550\u2013577) wrote: \"Today the jiaozi, shaped like a crescent moon, is a common food in the world.\" Six Dynasties Turfan tombs contained dumplings. Later in the Tang dynasty (AD 618\u2013907), jiaozi become more popular, called Bian Shi (\u6241\u98df). Chinese archaeologists have found a bowl of jiaozi in the Tang dynasty tombs in Turpan. 7th or 8th century dumplings and wontons were found in Turfan.Jiaozi may also be named because they are horn-shaped. The Chinese word for \"horn\" is jiao (Chinese: \u89d2; pinyin: ji\u01ceo), and jiaozi was originally written with the Chinese character for \"horn\", but later it was replaced by the specific character \u9903, which has the food radical on the left and the phonetic component ji\u0101o (\u4ea4) on the right.\nAt the same time, jiaozi look like yuan bao silver or gold ingots used as currency during the Ming dynasty, and as the name sounds like the word for the earliest paper money, serving them is believed to bring prosperity. Many families eat these at midnight on Chinese New Year's Eve. Some cooks will even hide a clean coin inside a jiaozi for the lucky to find.Nowadays, jiaozi are eaten year-round, and can be eaten for breakfast, lunch or dinner. They can be served as an appetizer, a side dish, or as the main course. In China, sometimes jiaozi is served as a last course during restaurant meals. As a breakfast dish, jiaozi are prepared alongside xiaolongbao at inexpensive roadside restaurants. Typically, they are served in small steamers containing ten pieces each. Although mainly serving jiaozi to breakfast customers, these small restaurants keep them hot on steamers and ready to eat all day. Jiaozi are always served with a dipping sauce that may include vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, rice wine, hot sauce, and sesame oil. They can also be served with soup."

Different shapes of Jiaozi require different folding techniques, but the most famous and common technique is the pinched-edge fold. Take a wrapper and put one tablespoon of filling into the center of the wrapper. Fold a half of edge to the other half. Use left thumb and forefinger to pinch one side of the half-moon wrapper, and then use right thumb to push the inside skin outward, right forefinger to make outside skin into small pleats. Use right thumb to clench those pleats. Repeat these steps to the other side of the wrapper, and make sure to clench the seal of Jiaozi. This is crescent-shaped jiaozi, the most popular shape in China."

There is a record dating to 733 when rice was collected as a brewing fee tax under the jurisdiction of the government office called Miki no Tsukasa. In the Shoku Nihongi, written in 797, there is a record of King Ashihara who got drunk and was murdered in a tavern in 761.The full-scale development of izakaya began around the Edo period (1603\u20131867). At liquor stores that used to sell alcohol by weight, people began to drink alcohol while standing. Gradually, some izakaya began using sake barrels as stools for their customers, and gradually began to offer simple snacks called sakana. Historian Penelope Francks points to the development of the izakaya in Japan, especially in Edo and along main roads throughout the country, as one indicator of the growing popularity of sake as a consumer good by the late 1700s.An izakaya in Tokyo made international news in 1962, when Robert F. Kennedy ate there during a meeting with Japanese labor leaders.Izakaya and other small pubs or establishments are exempted from a smoking ban that was passed by the National Diet in July 2018 and fully enforced since April 2020."

Many izakaya offer a choice of both as well as seating by the bar. Some izakaya restaurants are also tachi-nomi style, literally translated as \"drinking while standing\".Usually, customers are given an oshibori (wet towel) to clean their hands; the towels are cold in summer and hot in winter. Next, a tiny appetizer, called an ot\u014dshi in the Tokyo area or tsukidashi in the Osaka-Kobe area, is served. It is local custom and usually charged onto the bill in lieu of an entry fee.\nThe menu may be on the table, displayed on walls, or both. Picture menus are common in larger izakaya. Food and drink are ordered throughout the course of the session as desired. They are brought to the table, and the bill is added up at the end of the session. Unlike other Japanese styles of eating, food items are usually shared by everyone at the table, similar to Spanish tapas.\nCommon styles of izakaya dining in Japan are nomi-h\u014ddai (\"all you can drink\") and tabe-h\u014ddai (\"all you can eat\"). For a set price per person, customers can continue ordering as much food and/or drink as they wish, usually with a time limit of two or three hours.\nIzakaya dining can be intimidating to non-Japanese because of the wide variety of menu items and the slow pace. Food is normally ordered slowly over several courses rather than all at once. The kitchen will serve the food when it is ready, rather than in the formal courses of Western restaurants. Typically, a beer is ordered when one is sitting down before perusing the menu. Quickly prepared dishes such as hiyayakko or edamame are ordered first, followed with progressively more robust flavors such as yakitori or karaage, finishing the meal with a rice or noodle dish to fill up."

Watami, Shoya, Shirokiya, Tsubohachi, and Murasaki are some of the well known chains in Japan.\nIzakaya are often called akach\u014dchin (\"red lantern\"), after the red paper lanterns traditionally displayed outside. Today, the term usually refers to small, non-chain izakaya. Some unrelated businesses that are not izakaya also sometimes display red lanterns.Cosplay izakaya became popular in the 2000s. The staff wear costumes and wait on customers. In some establishments, shows are performed. Costumes include those for butlers and maids.Establishments specialising in oden are called oden-ya. They usually take the form of street stalls with seating and are popular in winter.\nRobatayaki are places in which customers sit around an open hearth on which chefs grill seafood and vegetables. Fresh ingredients are displayed for customers to point at whenever they want to order.\nYakitori-ya specialise in yakitori, grilled chicken skewers. The chicken skewers are often grilled in front of customers."

        "content": "Izakaya appear in Japanese novels with adaptations to TV drama and film. They have also inspired manga and gekiga. A modern novel, Izakaya Ch\u014dji (\u5c45\u9152\u5c4b\u5146\u6cbb) is an example where the main character manages an izakaya; in the film adaptation, Ken Takakura played the part of Ch\u014dji. A TV drama was produced in 1992 on Friday Drama Theater, Fuji Television. Another film, Izakaya Y\u016brei, starring Kenichi Hagiwara, is a comical ghost story; a typical izakaya in Yokohama is run by the owner, his new wife and the ghost of his former wife.Images of izakaya in jidaigeki novels and films reflect the modern drinking and dining style of today sitting at tables. This was not often seen in countryside, aside from station towns along kaid\u014d highways in the 17th to mid-19th century. Capacities at izakaya were restricted in major cities in the period that jidaigeki TV shows and films/movies set in Edo.The 2006 manga series Shin'ya Shokud\u014d depicts the manager of a 12-seat izakaya in Shinjuku, Tokyo, that only opens from 12pm to 7am. The manga was later turned into a TV show, which was widely distributed throughout Asia and the internationally on Netflix, followed by two films. There were also several remakes made in countries such as China and Korea.\nThe 2012 manga series Isekai Izakaya \"Nobu\" (Alternate World Bar \"Nobu\") depicted a new izakaya whose front door opened to a parallel world, vaguely reminiscent of 15th century Germany. The izakaya featured a wide range of food and drinks from Japan. An anime adaptation premiered in 2018 and a live-action adaptation premiered in 2020."

It is also regularly consumed in any shape in small portions.\nAs a product, jam\u00f3n is similar to Portuguese presunto and to Italian prosciutto, but the production differs by a longer curing phase (up to 18 months), giving a dryer texture, deeper color and stronger flavour.\nA whole jam\u00f3n leg is considerably cheaper by weight than its sliced counterpart because it includes the bone and non-edible fat. Once the external fat layers are removed and the meat is exposed, the product must be consumed as soon as possible since a progressive drying and deteriorating process starts. This is not an issue for restaurateurs and retailers, since they go through product much faster than an individual. Home users will typically choose sliced product, be it freshly cut from a deli stand, commercially pre-packaged or vacuum preserved. Jam\u00f3n is safe to consume as long as the leg is kept in a dry and cool environment and out of direct sunlight, but it must be kept refrigerated once cut away from the leg.Jam\u00f3n may also be smoked in some regions, where it is used mostly for personal consumption. This form of ham is common in the southern areas of Castile and Le\u00f3n as well as in parts of Extremadura. Such a jam\u00f3n has a harder texture and a smoky-salty flavour.\nThough widely available in Spain (even if on the expensive side) and accessible in some countries of the European Union, import duties and trade or food safety restrictions applied to foreign meat products in international markets may raise prices substantially while creating scarcity, often making jam\u00f3n a prohibitively expensive product for other countries to import.\nThere are two main commercial labels for jam\u00f3n, based on the pig breed and protected designations:\n\nJam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico is made from the black Iberian pig, and may be consumed internationally as a delicacy.\nJam\u00f3n serrano (meaning \"sierra ham\") includes most other varieties."

This is the most commonly produced and consumed range of jam\u00f3n in Spain. The majority of jamones serranos are produced from a landrace breed of white pigs or from commercial breeds such as Duroc. Jam\u00f3n serrano, described variously as jam\u00f3n reserva, jam\u00f3n curado, and jam\u00f3n extra or any generic jam\u00f3n nomenclature, is produced from compound-fed white pigs.Jam\u00f3n serrano has TSG (Traditional Speciality Guaranteed) status in the EU and the UK.

The first restaurant location and headquarters are in Corte Madera, California, the second in San Francisco. They then branched out to Las Vegas, Nevada, Colorado, Seattle, and Virginia, opening a total of 22 by 2008.In 1997 the company became publicly traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange. By 2000 the company had $124 million annual revenues. The company was eventually taken private again in a leveraged buyout. Mindel sold most of his equity and retired from daily operations of the group in 2001 (his son, Michael, continued and is Senior Vice President of Marketing as of 2014), and in 2003 opened Poggio at the Casa Madrona Hotel in Sausalito as a personal project.Under the direction of Executive Chef Maurizio Mazzon, a native of Venice, the company launched a second concept, Canaletto Ristorante Veneto, at the Venetian in Las Vegas in 1999, with a second location in 2008 in Fashion Island shopping mall in Newport Beach, California."

Frank Zerilli changed the oven from coal to gas by the 1980s as well, and more recently Veniero's began selling carb-free cheesecakes and sugar-free cookies.Pasticceria is Italian for \"cake shop\" or \"confectioner's shop.\"Veniero's is famous for its traditional and regional Italian confections, including handmade Italian butter cookies, biscotti, cannoli, sfogliatelle, tiramis\u00f9, and its New York staple cheesecake.Veniero's was featured in the first New York City episode of Food Network's Road Tasted  and has been featured on many other shows, including ABC's Good Morning America and Live with Regis and Kelly, and Steve Schirripa's Hungry on the cable channel Mag Rack.  The bakery has also been the location for scenes on NBC's Law & Order.  It was also featured on HBO's Curb Your Enthusiasm season 8, episode 76, in a comedic plot where the main character uses the bakery's hard crust Italian bread as an improvised weapon. \nIn 2010, Veniero's was named the winner for the Best Desserts in New York City by AOL's City's Best website.  Furthermore, some food tour companies visit Veniero's as part of their programs."

It was very popular during the Middle Ages, when it was made plain or scented with orange flowers.It is made by hand by boiling the milk and coagulating it with a vegetable element such as the thistle flower (Cynara cardunculus), lemon juice or an animal element (rennet). The resulting product is filtered through a cloth in wicker or cane containers. A white, slightly sweet pasty mass is thus obtained due to the effect of the concentration of lactose in the milk.\nIndustrial manufacturing uses the same physical-chemical principle but pasteurized milk and large-capacity stainless steel tanks are used.\nMat\u00f3 is consumed as a dessert. It can be sprinkled with sugar, although the most traditional way is the one that uses honey to sweeten it. It is also used in some preparations such as cottage cheese cake (Greixonera de Brossat), as well as the preparation of a cake such as coca de brossat (coc de brossat)."

Taco in the sense of a typical Mexican dish comprising a maize tortilla folded around food is just one of the meanings connoted by the word, according to the Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola, publisher of Diccionario de la Lengua Espa\u00f1ola. This meaning of the Spanish word \"taco\" is a Mexican innovation, but the word \"taco\" is used in other contexts to mean \"wedge; wad, plug; billiard cue; blowpipe; ramrod; short, stocky person; [or] short, thick piece of wood.\" The etymological origin of this sense of the word is Germanic and has cognates in other European languages, including the French word tache and the English word \"tack\".In Spain, the word \"taco\" can also be used in the context of tacos de jam\u00f3n:  these are diced pieces of ham, or sometimes bits and shavings of ham leftover after a larger piece is sliced. They can be served on their own as tapas or street food, or can be added to other dishes such as salmorejo, omelettes, stews, empanadas, or mel\u00f3n con jam\u00f3n.According to one etymological theory, the culinary origin of the term \"taco\" in Mexico can be traced to its employment, among Mexican silver miners, as a term signifying \"plug.\" The miners used explosive charges in plug form, consisting of a paper wrapper and gunpowder filling.Indigenous origins are also proposed. One possibility is that the word derives from the Nahuatl word tlahco, meaning \"half\" or \"in the middle\", in the sense that food would be placed in the middle of a tortilla. Furthermore, dishes analogous to the taco were known to have existed in Pre-Columbian society\u2014for example, the Nahuatl word tlaxcalli (a type of corn tortilla)."

Others argue that the advent of the taco is much more recent, with one of the more popular theories being that the taco was invented by silver miners in the 18th century,One of the oldest mentions of a taco comes from an 1836 cookbook \u2014Nuevo y sencillo arte de cocina, reposteria y refrescos\u2014 by Antonia Carrillo; in a recipe for a rolled pork loin (lomo de cerdo enrollado), she instructs the readers to roll the loin like they would a \u201ctaco de tortilla\u201d or tortilla taco.\nAnother mention of the word taco comes from the novel \u2014El hombre de la situaci\u00f3n (1861)\u2014 by Mexican writer Manuel Payno: \u201cThey surrounded the father's bed, and he, putting a pillow on his legs, which served as a table, began to give the example, and a pleasant gathering was formed, which was completed by the mother, who always entered last, waving with one hand (from right to left) a large cup of white atole, while with the other, she carried right to her mouth, a tortilla taco filled with a spread of red chile. These instances predate the theory that the first mention of the word \"taco\" in Mexico was in the 1891 novel Los bandidos de R\u00edo Fr\u00edo by Manuel Payno."

        "content": "There are many traditional varieties of tacos:\n\nTacos al pastor (\"shepherd style\") or tacos de adobada are made of thin pork steaks seasoned with adobo seasoning, then skewered and overlapped on one another on a vertical rotisserie cooked and flame-broiled as it spins.\nTacos de asador (\"spit\" or \"grill\" tacos) may be composed of any of the following: carne asada tacos; tacos de tripita (\"tripe tacos\"), grilled until crisp; and, chorizo asado (traditional Spanish-style sausage). Each type is served on two overlapped small tortillas and sometimes garnished with guacamole, salsa, onions, and cilantro (coriander leaf). Also, prepared on the grill is a sandwiched taco called mulita (\"little mule\") made with meat served between two tortillas and garnished with Oaxaca style cheese. Mulita is used to describe these types of sandwiched tacos in the Northern States of Mexico while they are known as gringas in the Mexican south and are prepared using wheat flour tortillas. Tacos may also be served with salsa.\nTacos de cabeza (\"head tacos\"), in which there is a flat punctured metal plate from which steam emerges to cook the head of the cow. These include: Cabeza, a serving of the muscles of the head; Sesos (\"brains\"); Lengua (\"tongue\"); Cachete (\"cheeks\"); Trompa (\"lips\"); and, Ojo (\"eye\"). Tortillas for these tacos are warmed on the same steaming plate for a different consistency. These tacos are typically served in pairs, and also include salsa, onion, and cilantro (coriander leaf) with occasional use of guacamole.\nTacos de camarones (\"shrimp tacos\") also originated in Baja California in Mexico. Grilled or fried shrimp are used, usually with the same accompaniments as fish tacos: lettuce or cabbage, pico de gallo, avocado and a sour cream or citrus/mayonnaise sauce, all placed on top of a corn or flour tortilla.\nTacos de cazo (literally \"bucket tacos\") for which a metal bowl filled with lard is typically used as a deep-fryer. Meats for these types of tacos typically include Tripa (\"tripe\", usually from a pig instead of a cow, and can also refer to the intestines); Suadero (tender beef cuts), Carnitas and Buche (literally, \"crop\", as in bird's crop; or the esophagus of any animal).\nTacos de lengua (beef tongue tacos), which are cooked in water with onions, garlic, and bay leaves for several hours until tender and soft, then sliced and saut\u00e9ed in a small amount of oil. \"It is said that unless a taquer\u00eda offers tacos de lengua, it is not a real taquer\u00eda.\"Tacos de pescado (\"fish tacos\") originated in Baja California in Mexico, where they consist of grilled or fried fish, lettuce or cabbage, pico de gallo, and a sour cream or citrus/mayonnaise sauce, all placed on top of a corn or flour tortilla. In the United States, they were first popularized by the Rubio's fast-food chain, and remain most popular in California, Colorado, and Washington. In California, they are often found at street vendors, and a regional variation is to serve them with cabbage and coleslaw dressing on top.\nTacos dorados (fried tacos; literally, \"golden tacos\") called flautas (\"flute\", because of the shape), or taquitos, for which the tortillas are filled with pre-cooked shredded chicken, beef or barbacoa, rolled into an elongated cylinder and deep-fried until crisp. They are sometimes cooked in a microwave oven or broiled.\nTacos sudados (\"sweaty tacos\") are made by filling soft tortillas with a spicy meat mixture, then placing them in a basket covered with cloth. The covering keeps the tacos warm and traps steam (\"sweat\") which softens them.\nTacos de birria (stewed meat tacos) are made with goat or beef roasted or stewed with spices and typically served with the broth from cooking the meat as a dipping sauce. Originating in the Mexican state of Jalisco, birria was mentioned in a 1925 Article in the El Paso Herald. The taqueria, El Remedio in San Antonio, began offering birria de res tacos in their current form in Texas in 2018. Offerings by taco stands in California and across the Southwest United States began occurring at about the same time.As an accompaniment to tacos, many taco stands will serve whole or sliced red radishes, lime slices, salt, pickled or grilled chilis (hot peppers), and occasionally cucumber slices, or grilled cambray onions."

According to official literature, Amato's sandwiches contained ham, American cheese, and fresh vegetables, which the Italian immigrants along the waterfront seemed to enjoy. Amato named his sandwich the \"Italian\" in honor of his country and his people (not, as is widely believed, because of its ingredients).In 1972, Dominic Reali, an employee at the original Amato's on India Street, purchased the store from his boss. Under Reali, the company increased from one store to thirteen, and began franchising.  Today there are 40 locations operating under the Amato's brand.

He had asthma as a child, forcing him to stay inside, where he watched his aunt cook. At age 13 he began working at a local pizzeria. In 1985 he won two plane tickets anywhere in the United States and, on a whim, chose to go to Phoenix.  When he got there, he felt connected to the place, and stayed.  He began making mozzarella in his apartment and selling it to Italian restaurants.  Later, Guy Coscos, a specialty grocer in Phoenix offered him the opportunity to make and sell pizzas in the corner of his store.  Bianco's pizza was popular and he realized he could make pizza for a living.  He went to Italy in 1993 to improve his pizzamaking.  In 1994, he returned to open Pizzeria Bianco at Town & Country Shopping Center in Phoenix.  In 1996, the restaurant moved to 623 East Adams Street, the historic site of Baird Machine Shop in Heritage Square.  Bianco also operates Bar Bianco, located next door to the pizzeria in Heritage Square, and Pane Bianco, located in Midtown Phoenix.Bianco cites Alice Waters, Suzanne Goin at Lucques, Mark Ladner at Del Posto, and Mario Batali as chefs who have inspired him."

In January 2010, Bianco announced that he was taking some time away from pizza making for health reasons (the wood oven and flour in the air was aggravating his asthma).

        "content": "The company was founded in 1964 on West 56th Street in New York City by 25-year-old Hiroaki Aoki, the father of Steve Aoki and Devon Aoki.Aoki, a wrestler who had qualified for but did not attend the 1960 Summer Olympics, started the restaurant with US$10,000 (equivalent to $98,240 in 2023) earned from driving an ice cream truck in Harlem.  The first restaurant, Benihana of Tokyo, was named for the red safflower that was the name for the coffee shop owned by his parents in Tokyo.\nAoki's concept was for the meals to be theatrically prepared by a knife-wielding, joke-telling chef at a teppanyaki table surrounded by a wooden eating surface in front of the guests (teppan meaning \"steel grill\" or \"griddle\" and yaki meaning \"grilled\" or \"broiled\").  It did not do well until early 1965, when Clementine Paddleford of the New York Herald Tribune gave it a rave review.The Beatles and Muhammad Ali were among the celebrities who patronized the four-table restaurant.Within a year Aoki opened a bigger restaurant that featured samurai armor, heavy wooden ceiling beams, and sliding sh\u014dji screens to provide some privacy.In 1968, it opened its first restaurant outside of New York City in Chicago.In 1976, Aoki brought in consultant Hardwicke Companies (its founder Charles H. Stein was the original developer of Six Flags Great Adventure, as well as the operator of various New York restaurants including Tavern on the Green) as a partner to run the company. In 1980, Aoki terminated the relationship and settled a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission complaint of insider trading of Hardwicke stock.In 1982, Benihana National Corporation went public with Joel Schwartz as president. Some of the restaurants continued to be privately owned by Aoki. The company had some missteps including the opening of the upscale Big Splash restaurant and a frozen food division, Benihana National Classics. Its stock dived and shareholders sued over management including the fact that Aoki still had his privately held restaurants of the same name.In 1995, the company acquired 17 restaurants from Benihana of Tokyo.The company has since expanded by purchasing the Haru and RA Sushi restaurants, which operate under those names. Haru is based in New York City; RA has locations across the country, and is based in Scottsdale, Arizona, with its original four locations scattered around the greater Phoenix area. Although Benihana owns these concepts, they are independently operated and were developed autonomously. It also acquired the Samurai and Kyoto restaurants which it has incorporated into its other brands.In 2004, the company issued a class of preferred stock to BFC Financial corporation to renovate its restaurants and expand. The stock diluted Aoki's control of the chain and the family sued, citing that Benihana had no compelling need for the cash, other forms of capital were available, and that the terms of the preferred stock issued to BFC were onerous. A  member of the board of directors was also a director of BFC, a company that held controlling interests in BankAtlantic, Blue Green, and Levitt Homes. However, the Delaware Court of Chancery upheld the decision.Benihana's famous figural \"tiki mugs\" for exotic cocktails, the most common of which depicts \"Hotei,\" a chubby buddha-like figure with arms raised in the air, have become collectible.Aoki died in 2008 at the age of 69.In 2009, Richard C. Stockinger became chief executive to replace Joel A. Schwartz, and in 2010 became president as Juan C. Garcia resigned.Benihana agreed in 2012 to be purchased by the private equity firm of Angelo Gordon & Company for $296 million.On February 5, 2014, the Board of Directors of Benihana Inc. named Steve Shlemon the company's new president and chief executive officer.In 2016, Benihana Inc. named Thomas J. Baldwin CEO and president. Baldwin had been director of Benihana and served as an advisor to the operator's principal investor, Angelo, Gordon & Co.In 2023 Benihana was exploring a possible sale that could value the chain at $600 million or more."

The word is originally a compound of the two Proven\u00e7al verbs bolhir ('to boil') and abaissar ('to reduce heat', i.e. 'simmer').\nBouillabaisse was originally a dish made by Marseille fishers, using the bony rockfish which they were unable to sell to restaurants or markets. There are at least three kinds of fish in a traditional bouillabaisse, typically red rascasse (Scorpaena scrofa); sea robin; and European conger. It can also include gilt-head bream, turbot, monkfish, mullet, or European hake.  It usually also includes shellfish and other seafood such as sea urchins, mussels, velvet crabs, spider crab or octopus. More expensive versions may add langoustine (Dublin Bay prawn; Norway lobster), though this was not part of the traditional dish made by Marseille fishers.  Vegetables such as leeks, onions, tomatoes, celery, and potatoes are simmered together with the broth and served with the fish. The broth is traditionally served with a rouille, a mayonnaise made of olive oil, garlic, saffron, and cayenne pepper on grilled slices of bread.\nWhat makes a bouillabaisse different from other fish soups is the selection of Proven\u00e7al herbs and spices in the broth; the use of bony local Mediterranean fish; the way the fish are added one at a time, and brought to a boil; and the method of serving. In Marseille, the broth is served first in a soup plate with slices of bread and rouille, then the fish is served separately on a large platter  (see image at top);  or, more simply,  as Julia Child suggests, the fish and broth are brought to the table separately and served together in large soup plates."

It usually also has congre (eng: European conger) and grondin (eng: sea robin). According to the Michelin Guide Vert, the four essential elements of a true bouillabaisse are the presence of rascasse, the freshness of the fish; olive oil, and excellent saffron.The American chef and food writer Julia Child, who lived in Marseille for a year, wrote: \"to me the telling flavor of bouillabaisse comes from two things: the Proven\u00e7al soup base\u2014garlic, onions, tomatoes, olive oil, fennel, saffron, thyme, bay, and usually a bit of dried orange peel\u2014and, of course, the fish\u2014lean (non-oily), firm-fleshed, soft-fleshed, gelatinous, and shellfish.\""

The fish simmer as the broth is then reduced, usually about twenty minutes.\nWhen the bouillabaisse is done, the rouille is prepared: the stem of the garlic is removed; the garlic cloves are crushed into a fine paste with a pestle in a mortar; the egg yolk and saffron are added and blended with olive oil little by little to make a mayonnaise.\nThe potatoes are peeled, cut into large slices and boiled in salted water for 15 to 20 minutes.\nThe last step is to open the sea urchins with a pair of scissors, and to remove the corail (gonads)  with a small spoon.  The pieces of fish are then arranged on a platter, and the corail of the sea urchins is added to the broth and stirred.\nIn this traditional version, the bouillon is served first, very hot, with the rouille spread on thick slices of bread rubbed with garlic. The fish and potatoes are served next on a separate platter.Another version of the classic Marseille bouillabaisse, presented in the Petit LaRousse de la Cuisine, uses congre, dorade, grondin, lotte, merlan, rascasse, saint-pierre, and velvet crabs (\u00e9trilles), and includes leeks. In this version, the heads and trimmings of the fish are put together with onions, celery and garlic browned in olive oil, and covered with boiling water for twenty minutes. Then the vegetables and bouquet garni are added, and then the pieces of fish in a specific order; first the rascasse, then the grondin, the lotte, congre, dorade, etrilles, and saffran. The dish is cooked for eight minutes over high heat. Then the most delicate fish, the saint pierre and merlan, are added, and the dish is cooked another 5\u20138 minutes. The broth is then served over bread with the rouille on top, and the fish and crabs are served on a large platter.Other variations add different seasonings, such as orange peel, and sometimes a cup of white wine or cognac is added."

They were different from the boullabaisse as they did not include saffron and rouille.The name bouillabaisse comes from the method of the preparation\u2014the ingredients are not added all at once. The broth is first boiled (bolh) then the different kinds of fish are added one by one, and each time the broth comes to a boil, the heat is lowered (abaissa).Generally fish soups are found in France (bourride, chaudr\u00e9e), Greece, Italy (zuppa di pesce), Portugal (caldeirada), Spain (sopa de pescado y marisco, Catalonia (suquet de peix), and all the countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea. What makes a bouillabaisse different from these other dishes are the local Proven\u00e7al herbs and spices, the particular selection of bony Mediterranean coastal fish, and the way the broth is served separately from the fish and vegetables."

The simulated crab meat product kanikama (short for kani-kamaboko) is the best-known form of surimi in the West.\nRed-skinned and white kamaboko are typically served at celebratory and holiday meals, as red and white are considered to bring good luck. In Japan, the prepackaged snack chiikama (cheese plus kamaboko) is commonly sold in convenience stores. In the city of Uwajima, a type of fried kamaboko called jakoten is popular.

Others think the term was borrowed from other languages because of the large use of similar foods throughout the Eastern Roman Empire. The term piada was officialized by Giovanni Pascoli, who adapted the Romagnol word pi\u00e8 into its more Italian form.  Romagna was heavily influenced by Byzantium during the early Middle Ages when the Eastern Empire reconquered parts of the Western domain which had fallen to the invading barbarians. In those days Ravenna was the capital city of the Exarchate, and that would explain how the Greco-Byzantine recipe entered the local gastronomy.\nThe first written evidence of piadina as it is now recognized dates back to 1371, in the Descriptio Romandiolae compiled by Cardinal Anglico, who for the first time gave the recipe of the bread of the people of Romagna: \"It is made with wheat flour moistened with water and flavoured with salt. It is then kneaded with milk as well, and also a little lard.\""

The bread is known in Swedish as v\u00f6rtbr\u00f6d/v\u00f6rtlimpa (\"wort bread/loaf\"). It is a yeast-leavened spice loaf, sweetened with brown sugar and molasses which comes in a large variety in regard to whether or not butter-enriched, and which spices are being used. Traditional bread spices are anise, caraway, fennel seeds, and bitter orange.\nTypically baked during the Christmas season, the festive wort breads/loaves (Swedish: v\u00f6rtbr\u00f6d / v\u00f6rtlimpa) are flavoured with spices like anise, caraway, and fennel seeds, and often orange rinds, raisins or sultanas, and dark beer, in addition to the wort. Its distinct taste and look is in large part due to the addition of wort to the dough, making it similar to a malt loaf. It is a typical dish for a traditional Christmas Eve sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord or julbord. Limpa bread pairs well with jams and jellies, or cream cheese."

Once this mixture has cooled to a lukewarm temperature it is combined with activated yeast and rye flour. The dough rises and more flour is added to knead the dough in preparation for a second rise, then the tops are brushed with melted butter and the loaves are baked.

Other flours blended in with the rye, depending on the recipe, can include cornmeal, whole wheat flour or all purpose flour. To add the orange flavor orange oil or orange zest can be used. Although not strictly traditional in the origin area of northern Sweden, some variations on the basic recipe may add raisins or prunes.

The current Jake's Restaurant and its predecessor establishments date back to 1892, establishing it as Portland's second oldest continuously operating restaurant. The original restaurant was called Mueller and Meier, a saloon established in 1892 at 18th and Washington Streets. This restaurant was one of two crawfish houses in Portland at the turn of the century. Mueller and Meier moved to the Whitney & Gray Building in 1911, where it operated as a saloon until 1913, when it became Mueller and Meier Cafe. In 1916 statewide prohibition took effect in Oregon and the restaurant began a soft drink service, a focus that continued throughout Prohibition.\nIn 1920, Mueller and Meier sold their interests to Jacob J. Freiman and J. Rometsch. Jake Freiman, the original \"Jake\", had been a waiter at the Quelle Restaurant, a crawfish house established by Fritz Sichtem and Baron Schlenk in 1893. Freiman, a popular waiter and local character, brought with him the crawfish expertise, a large customer following, and popularity which established the reputation that has continued to the current day.\n\nIn 1921, or 1922, Rometsch left or was bought out by Clem Hackman, and the latter association continued until 1933 when Jake died. The operation was then sold to Joseph Kaffesieder. Joe Kaffesieder, an outgoing personality himself, maintained the traditions and character of the restaurant and, in fact, also was known to many patrons as \"Jake\". The restaurant was later operated by Max Kaffesieder, Joe's son. Walter E. Holman Sr., acquired the restaurant in 1946 and operated it until 1958, when he sold the establishment to his son Walter Jr., who operated in until 1960. It was\nthen sold to three investors, Orton Hall, a dentist, Glen Westfall, a contractor, and a third party. In 1961, Howard Wilson, a former manager under Walter Holman, acquired the facility with partner Nick Shewczyk. The current owner, William McCormick, acquired the restaurant in 1971.In 1972, William \"Bill\" McCormick purchased Jake's Famous Crawfish and hired Doug Schmick as his manager. Several years later, the pair formed a partnership that would later become the restaurant chain McCormick & Schmick's.The building that has housed the restaurant since 1911 was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1983, as the Whitney & Gray Building and Jake's Famous Crawfish Restaurant."

It was originally called the Vieux Carr\u00e9 restaurant and was located on Bourbon Street across from the Old Absinthe House until 1956 when it moved to its current location.\nThis building, a two-story French Quarter mansion at 417 Royal Street constructed in 1795, was built for Don Jos\u00e9 Faurie and later housed the Banque de la Louisiane, the first bank in Louisiana. From 1841 to 1891, the mansion had been owned by the Morphy family, with Paul Morphy, the celebrated chess player and unofficial world chess champion, living there until his death in 1884. In 1920 William Ratcliffe Irby gave the building to Tulane University  and it was initially leased by Owen Brennan in 1954 to open the following year as Brennan's. The restaurant purchased the building in 1984.Because Brennan's father owned a share of the restaurant, the restaurant was eventually inherited by Brennan's siblings as well as his children. In 1973, disagreement within the Brennan family over the expansion of the restaurant line led to a split into several different corporations, with the original New Orleans restaurant being wholly owned by Brennan's widow and children, and other restaurants in New Orleans, Houston, and Dallas, the Brennan Family Restaurants, being owned by Brennan's siblings and their children.\nAlthough the section of Royal Street in the French Quarter was spared the flooding suffered by most of the city in the levee failures during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Brennan's did suffer significant damage, largely due to the contents of second-story refrigerators melting and seeping onto lower floors. The restaurant's extensive wine cellar lost temperature control, ruining the entire wine collection.\nFollowing an extensive renovation, Brennan's re-opened on June 8, 2006. Brennan's closed on June 28, 2013. The new owners of Brennan's, Terry White and Ralph Brennan (a cousin of the former owners) purchased the building and the business at auction(s) after the former owners ran into financial trouble.  For more than a year, the historic building (circa 1795) underwent an extensive renovation. The new Brennan's was unveiled in the fall of 2014."

Preparation of a single portion may take up to six hours. Although the dish is traditionally prepared with clay, the recipe has evolved; for convenience and safety it is often baked with dough, oven bags, ceramic cooking pots, or convection ovens."

        "content": "Beggar's chicken is very popular in China, with many regions claiming it as traditionally their own. Most experts agree the dish originated in Hangzhou. The clay-wrapped method of slow cooking is thousands of years old.Various legends surround the origins of beggar's chicken. In one, a beggar stole a chicken from a farm but having no pot or utensils, he wrapped the bird in lotus leaves and packed clay or mud around it, set it in a hole where he had lit a fire, and buried it. When he dug up the chicken and cracked open the clay, he found the meat was tender and aromatic. In other versions, the beggar stole the chicken from the emperor and used the mud-hole method to avoid smoke that might attract the imperial guards. Alternatively, the emperor stopped to dine with the beggar and so enjoyed the dish that he added it to the imperial menu and the beggar prospered by selling the dish to locals. Another legend, the dish was a childhood favorite of Emperor Gaozu of Han, who had been born a peasant. When he became emperor, the recipe became an imperial specialty. Finally, in another legend, during the 17th century toward the end of the Ming dynasty in Changshu, saying that politician and Koxinga's mentor Qian Qianyi met the beggar who made the impromptu dish and had his chefs improved the recipe."

It can be prepared in ovens, outdoor grills and smokers, and campfires. Non-toxic clay for preparing beggar's chicken can be obtained from hardware or arts and craft stores; however, cooks must pay attention when baking the dish with clay because if too much heat is used, \"the earth may crack and it can be very dangerous\" due to the pressure buildup in the clay shell.  Preparing the dish with dough is safer; ceramic cooking pots can also be used to retain moisture, but these are expensive to purchase. Alternatively, an oven bag can be used when cooking it in a domestic oven.\n\n A convection oven can eliminate the need to cover the dish and allows it to cook evenly, but the chicken should still be wrapped with lotus leaves and sheets of aluminum foil, and would be ready in less time than in an electric oven. This simplified version of the dish is also called \"foiled chicken\"."

The newspaper's Walker MacMurdo wrote, \"You'll be hard-pressed to find a breakfast this big and this good at this price anywhere else on the westside, let alone in the rest of the city. In an area that has developed into a jungle of Chipotle-wave d\u00e9cor, millennial apartment complexes and elite boutiques, Fuller's remains a deservedly popular bastion of a bygone time when elderly men in overalls could enjoy a glass of milk with their omelet.\" Portland Mercury's Megan Burbank wrote in 2017: If you want to spend brunch feeling like you're inside an Edward Hopper painting, you can't do better. And if, like me, your Waterloo of breakfast is deciding between savory and sweet, go for the breakfast special ... it has it all! ... There are tables outside, but the gem of Fuller's is its counter, which brings a sense of remarkable efficiency to the whole operation, and makes an especially good spot for solo brunching alongside loyal regulars and slumming Pearl District yuccies alike. In other words, it's perfect.\nThe Oregonian's Michael Russell has described the cheeseburger as \"what a McDonald's burger might still look like if the global corporation hadn't been worrying about shareholders for the past five decades\". He included Fuller's in his 2018\u20132020 overviews of the city's \"best inexpensive restaurants\".

Lizzy Acker and Russell ranked Fuller's number 21 in a 2019 list of the city's best corned beef hashes, and said, \"The food is good, the prices are hard to beat, but it's the old-school ambiance and friendly (but not overly friendly) service that keep us coming back to Fuller's.\"\nIn 2018, Food & Wine's David Landsel also said that the diner appears \"out of a Hopper painting\" and called the omelettes \"pretty great\". His 2020 overview of the nation's best diners described Fuller's as an \"alluring corner joint where each seat in the restaurant is a counter seat, backed by giant windows that even on the darkest days, lend Portland's finest no-nonsense diner an abundance of natural light. Classic it may be, but there's a distinctive creativity to the menu here, nearly essential in a town where breakfast and brunch are essentially a new kind of religion\". Landsel recommended that diners \"try the indulgent Monte Cristo sandwich, or simply appreciate just how good a plate of bacon, eggs, and potatoes can be, when someone back behind the counter gives a damn about quality. Other breakfasts may be more famous, but let them wait for another day\u2014at Fuller's, chances are you won't feel like you're missing out, at all.\"\nEater Portland's Erin DeJesus included Fuller's in her 2013 list of the twelve \"best restaurants for dining solo\" in the city, in which she said that the diner \"maintains that old-school, every-man-for-himself vibe\" and recommended a visit \"for morning/lunchtime solo diners (or those who bury themselves in the newspaper when eating alone)\". In a 2016 list of \"Portland's 12 Iconic Greasy Spoon Breakfasts\", the website said, \"Fuller's isn't old-fashioned; it's just old...

Fuller's Burger Shack's entr\u00e9e ranked number seven in Portland Monthly's 2020 list of the city's 20 best cheeseburgers; comparing the cheeseburger to the version served at Fuller's Coffee Shop, writers for the magazine said that \"the Burger Shack version is a hair better than the coffee shop original. What we loved: the warm creaminess, the perfect proportions, the luscious char, the splendid crunch of whole iceberg leaves, the way the cheese pooled over the edges\". Thrillist said that the diner feels \"like something you'd find on the way out of town, not a couple minutes from what people don't actually call Portland's financial district (even though it's true). The food is cheap but delicious. It's not trying to be anything other than a place for properly cooked eggs, crispy hash browns, and a seemingly never-ending cup of hot coffee.\" Fodor's Inside Portland (2020) described Fuller's as a \"reliably good greasy spoon\" with an \"endearing\" neon sign."

        "content": "The Romani, also spelled Romany or Rromani ( ROH-m\u0259-nee or  ROM-\u0259-nee) and colloquially known as the Roma (sg.: Rom), are an ethnic group of Indo-Aryan origin who traditionally lived a nomadic, itinerant lifestyle. Linguistic and genetic evidence suggests that the Romani originated in the Indian subcontinent, in particular the region of present-day Rajasthan. Their subsequent westward migration, possibly in waves, is now believed by historians to have occurred around 1000 CE. Their original name is from the Sanskrit word \u0921\u094b\u092e, doma and means a member of the Dom caste of travelling musicians and dancers. The Roma population moved west into the Persian Ghaznavid Empire and later into the Byzantine Empire. The Roma are thought to have arrived in Europe around the 13th to 14th century. Although they are widely dispersed, their most concentrated populations are located in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Spain, and Turkey.\nIn the English language, Romani people have long been known by the exonym Gypsies or Gipsies, which some Roma consider a racial slur. However, this is not always the case; for example, the term is actually preferred by most English and Welsh Romanies, and is used to refer to them in government documentation. The attendees of the first World Romani Congress in 1971 unanimously voted to reject the use of all exonyms for the Romani, including \"Gypsy\".Since the 19th century, some Romani have also migrated to the Americas. There are an estimated 1 million Roma in the United States and between 800,000 and 1 million in Brazil, most of whose ancestors emigrated in the 19th century from eastern Europe. Brazilian Romani are mostly descendant from German/Italian Sinti (in the South/Southeast regions), and Roma and Calon people. Brazil also includes a notable Romani community descended from Sinti and Roma deportees from the Portuguese Empire during the Portuguese Inquisition. In migrations since the late 19th century, Romani have also moved to other countries in South America and Canada. Though often confused with Irish Travellers and the Yenish people in western Europe, the Romani are culturally different.The Romani language is an Indo-Aryan language with strong Balkan and Greek influence. It is divided into several dialects, which together are estimated to have more than two million speakers. Because the language has traditionally been oral, many Romani are native speakers of the dominant language in their country of residence, or else of mixed languages combining the dominant language with a dialect of Romani in varieties sometimes called para-Romani."

        "content": "The traditional Romanies place a high value on the extended family. Traditionally, virginity is essential in unmarried women. However, Eastern European Roma people are more likely to find it acceptable for girls to have sex before marriage compared to other Eastern Europeans. Both men and women often marry young; there has been controversy in several countries over the Romani practice of child marriage. Romani law establishes that the man's family must pay a bride price to the bride's parents, but only traditional families still follow it.\nOnce married, the woman joins the husband's family, where her main job is to tend to her husband's and her children's needs and take care of her in-laws. The power structure in the traditional Romani household has at its top the oldest man or grandfather, and men, in general, have more authority than women. Women gain respect and power as they get older. Young wives begin gaining authority once they have children.Traditionally, as can be seen on paintings and photos, some Roma men wear shoulder-length hair and a mustache, as well as an earring.\nRoma women generally have long hair, and Xoraxane Roma women often dye it blonde with henna.Romani social behavior is strictly regulated by Indian social customs (\"marime\" or \"marhime\"), still respected by most Roma (and by most older generations of Sinti). This regulation affects many aspects of life and is applied to actions, people and things: parts of the human body are considered impure: the genital organs (because they produce emissions) and the rest of the lower body. Clothes for the lower body, as well as the clothes of menstruating women, are washed separately. Items used for eating are also washed in a different place. Childbirth is considered impure and must occur outside the dwelling place. The mother is deemed to be impure for forty days after giving birth.Death is considered impure, and affects the whole family of the dead, who remain impure for a period of time. In contrast to the practice of cremating the dead, Romani dead must be buried. Cremation and burial are both known from the time of the Rigveda, and both are widely practiced in Hinduism today (the general tendency is for Hindus to practice cremation, though some communities in modern-day south India tend to bury their dead). Animals that are considered to be having unclean habits are not eaten by the community."

They also often speak the languages of the countries they live in. Typically, they also incorporate loanwords and calques into Romani from the languages of those countries and especially words for terms that the Romani language does not have. Most of the Ciganos of Portugal, the Gitanos of Spain, the Romanichal of the UK, and Scandinavian Travellers have lost their knowledge of pure Romani, and speak the mixed languages Cal\u00f3, Angloromany, and Scandoromani, respectively. Most of the Romani language-speaking communities in these regions consist of later immigrants from eastern or central Europe.There are no concrete statistics for the number of Romani speakers, both in Europe and globally. However, a conservative estimate is 3.5 million speakers in Europe and a further 500,000 elsewhere, though the actual number may be considerably higher. This makes Romani the second-largest minority language in Europe, behind Catalan.In regards to the diversity of dialects, Romani works in the same way as most other European languages. Cross-dialect communication is dominated by the following features:\n\nAll Romani speakers are bilingual, accustomed to borrowing words or phrases from a second language; this makes it difficult to communicate with Romanis from different countries\nRomani was traditionally a language shared between extended family and a close-knit community. This has resulted in the inability to comprehend dialects from other countries, and is why Romani is sometimes considered to be several different languages.\nThere is no tradition or literary standard for Romani speakers to use as a guideline for their language use."

Partly for this reason, discrimination against the Romani has continued to be practiced to the present day, although efforts are being made to address it.Amnesty International reports continued to document instances of Antizigan discrimination during the late 20th century, particularly in Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, and Kosovo. The European Union has recognized that discrimination against Romani must be addressed, and with the national Roma integration strategy they encourage member states to work towards greater Romani inclusion and upholding the rights of the Romani in the European Union.\n\nIn eastern Europe, Roma children often attend Roma Special Schools, separate from non-Roma children; these schools tend to offer a lower quality of education than the traditional education options accessible by non-Roma children, putting the Roma children at an educational disadvantage.:\u200a83\u200aThe Romanis of Kosovo have been severely persecuted by ethnic Albanians since the end of the Kosovo War, and for the most part, the region's Romani community has been annihilated.Czechoslovakia carried out a policy of sterilization of Romani women, starting in 1973. The dissidents of the Charter 77 denounced it in 1977\u201378 as a genocide, but the practice continued through the Velvet Revolution of 1989. A 2005 report by the Czech Republic's independent ombudsman, Otakar Motejl, identified dozens of cases of coercive sterilization between 1979 and 2001, and called for criminal investigations and possible prosecution against several health care workers and administrators.In 2008, following the rape and subsequent murder of an Italian woman in Rome at the hands of a young man from a local Romani encampment, the Italian government declared that Italy's Romani population represented a national security risk and it also declared that it was required to take swift action to address the emergenza nomadi (nomad emergency). Specifically, officials in the Italian government accused the Romanies of being responsible for rising crime rates in urban areas.\nThe 2008 deaths of Cristina and Violetta Djeordsevic, two Roma children who drowned while Italian beach-goers remained unperturbed, brought international attention to the relationship between Italians and the Roma people. Reviewing the situation in 2012, one Belgian magazine observed:On International Roma Day, which falls on 8 April, the significant proportion of Europe's 12 million Roma who live in deplorable conditions will not have much to celebrate. And poverty is not the only worry for the community. Ethnic tensions are on the rise. In 2008, Roma camps came under attack in Italy, intimidation by racist parliamentarians is the norm in Hungary. Speaking in 1993, V\u00e1clav Havel prophetically remarked that \"the treatment of the Roma is a litmus test for democracy\": and democracy has been found wanting. The consequences of the transition to capitalism have been disastrous for the Roma. Under communism they had jobs, free housing and schooling. Now many are unemployed, many are losing their homes and racism is increasingly rewarded with impunity.\nThe 2016 Pew Research poll found that Italians, in particular, hold strong anti-Roma views, with 82% of Italians expressing negative opinions about Roma. In Greece, 67%, in Hungary 64%, in France 61%, in Spain 49%, in Poland 47%, in the UK 45%, in Sweden 42%, in Germany 40%, and in the Netherlands 37% had an unfavourable view of Roma. The 2019 Pew Research poll found that 83% of Italians, 76% of Slovaks, 72% of Greeks, 68% of Bulgarians, 66% of Czechs, 61% of Lithuanians, 61% of Hungarians, 54% of Ukrainians, 52% of Russians, 51% of Poles, 44% of French, 40% of Spaniards, and 37% of Germans held unfavorable views of Roma. IRES published in 2020 a survey which revealed that 72% of Romanians have a negative opinion about them.As of 2019, reports of anti-Roma incidents are increasing across Europe. Discrimination against Roma remains widespread in Kosovo, Romania, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and the Czech Republic, against which the European Court of Human Rights has ruled in Romani advocates' favor on the subject of discriminatory and segregationist education and housing practices. Roma communities across Ukraine have been the target of violent attacks.Roma refugees fleeing the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine have faced discrimination in Europe, including in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Moldova.Concerning employment, on average, across the European states which were surveyed, 16% of Roma women were in paid work in 2016 compared to a third of men."

Blanc was listed as running the restaurant. By 1879, Boston city records listed Luis Ober as the proprietor of a restaurant at 2 Winter Place of \"over twenty years' standing\".  From the start, the restaurant specialized in French food and was central to the financial, political, and intellectual history of Boston.\nLouis Ober was born in 1837 in the French department of Alsace. At age fourteen Ober moved to New York, working as a barber, book seller and importing and exporting goods between the United States and France. Ober lived and worked in New Jersey, Cincinnati, and Philadelphia, before settling in Boston. Ober was employed at the restaurant then owned and operated by Blanc. While in Blanc's employ, Ober became familiar with French food, fine wine and furnishings. By 1875, Ober had acquired ownership and applied to the city for expansion of the restaurant to 3-4 Winter Place. Financing was provided by Eben Jordan, a co-founder of the Jordan Marsh Company. The restaurant reopened as Ober's Restaurant Parisien.\nOver the next 20 years the restaurant was expanded and became furnished with increasingly luxurious imported materials typical of the Gilded Age, including Honduran mahogany, French furniture, Italian and French sculpture and paintings, English silver and Bohemian crystal lighting. Until 1970 the restaurant was open to males only.By the late twentieth century, Locke-Ober - though still possessing most of its original grand trappings - had lost much of its popularity. Boston restaurateur Lydia Shire, with investor Paul Licari, leased the space in 2001 and began a painstaking restoration of the main and private dining rooms on the third floor, adding two more contemporary rooms.  Jacky Robert was executive chef until 2003.  Nonetheless, the restaurant closed in 2012, with reports that the owners planned to sell the building.The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. The location is now occupied by Yvonne's.The restaurant was the setting of the opening scene in Robert B. Parker's 1980 Spenser novel Looking for Rachel Wallace. It was also the setting of the denouement of Death in a Tenured Position (also published as A Death in the Faculty) by Amanda Cross published in 1981. The detective, Kate Fansler, is taken there by the lawyer, John Cunningham, at which she presents to him her solution to the mystery. Cunningham claims Fansler only likes the restaurant because it used not to admit women; she denies this, saying she is attracted by the creamed spinach and the waiters who tended to be 'deaf and placating'. It was also the restaurant that Professor Lambeau took Robin Williams' character, Sean, to in an attempt to convince him to work with the main protagonist in Good Will Hunting. The fictional character I.M. Fletcher has lunch at Locke-Ober with newspaper editor Jack Saunders in the 1976 novel Confess, Fletch by Gregory McDonald."

        "content": "Fermented foods have a long history in many cultures, with sauerkraut being one of the most well-known instances of traditional fermented moist cabbage side dishes. The Roman writers Cato (in his De agri cultura) and Columella (in his De re Rustica) mentioned preserving cabbages and turnips with salt. Popular folklore has imagined that sauerkraut was introduced to Europe by the trade networks formed across Eurasia by the Golden Horde. However, according to Mack and Surina (2005), there is no evidence to support this theory, nor any evidence that fermented cabbage arrived from an East Asian source, and there is evidence of sauerkraut production in Europe dating back to the early period of the Western Roman Empire.Although \"sauerkraut\" is from a German word (Sauerkraut), the dish did not originate in Germany. Some claim fermenting cabbage suan cai was already practised in the days of the building of the Great Wall of China. However, the Romans, as previously noted, pickled forms of cabbage, and were the more likely source of modern-day European sauerkraut. It then took root in Central and Eastern European cuisines, but also in other countries including the Netherlands, where it is known as zuurkool, and France, where the name became choucroute. According to Mack and Surina (2005), the Slavic peoples of Europe likely discovered fermented cabbage on their own. The English name is borrowed from German where it means \"sour cabbage\".The names in Slavic and other Central and Eastern European languages have similar meanings with the German word: \"fermented cabbage\" (Albanian: lak\u00ebr turshi, Azerbaijani: k\u0259l\u0259m tur\u015fusu, Belarusian: \u043a\u0432\u0430\u0448\u0430\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430, Czech: kysan\u00e9 zel\u00ed, Lithuanian: rauginti kop\u016bstai, Polish: kapusta kiszona, Russian: \u043a\u0432\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430/\u043a\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430,, romanized: kva\u0161enaja kapusta, Turkish: lahana tur\u015fusu, \nRomanian: varz\u0103 murat\u0103, Persian: kalam tor\u015f, Bulgarian: \u043a\u0438\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0437\u0435\u043b\u0435, Estonian: hapukapsas, Finnish: hapankaali, Hungarian: savany\u00fak\u00e1poszta, Latvian: sk\u0101b\u0113ti k\u0101posti, Macedonian: \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u043b / \u043a\u0438\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0430 \u0437\u0435\u043b\u043a\u0430, Serbo-Croatian: \u043a\u0438\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0443\u0441 / \u043a\u0438\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0437\u0435\u0459\u0435, kiseli kupus / kiselo zelje, Slovak: kysl\u00e1 kapusta, Slovene: kislo zelje, Ukrainian: \u043a\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430, kysla kapusta).Before frozen foods, refrigeration, and cheap transport from warmer areas became readily available in Northern, Central, and Eastern Europe, sauerkraut \u2013 like other preserved foods \u2013 provided a source of nutrients during the winter. Captain James Cook always took a store of sauerkraut on his sea voyages, since experience had taught him it prevented scurvy.The word \"Kraut\", derived from this food, is a derogatory term for the German people. During World War I, due to concerns the American public would reject a product with a German name, American sauerkraut makers relabeled their product as \"liberty cabbage\" for the duration of the war."

        "content": "Sauerkraut is made by a process of pickling called lactic acid fermentation that is analogous to how traditional (not heat-treated) pickled cucumbers and kimchi are made. The cabbage is finely shredded, layered with salt, and left to ferment. Fully cured sauerkraut keeps for several months in an airtight container stored at 15 \u00b0C (60 \u00b0F) or below. Neither refrigeration nor pasteurization is required, although these treatments prolong storage life.\nFermentation by lactobacilli is introduced naturally, as these air-borne bacteria culture on raw cabbage leaves where they grow. Yeasts also are present, and may yield soft sauerkraut of poor flavor when the fermentation temperature is too high. The fermentation process has three phases, collectively sometimes referred to as population dynamics. In the first phase, anaerobic bacteria such as Klebsiella and Enterobacter lead the fermentation, and begin producing an acidic environment that favors later bacteria. The second phase starts as the acid levels become too high for many bacteria, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides and other Leuconostoc species take dominance. In the third phase, various Lactobacillus species, including L. brevis and L. plantarum, ferment any remaining sugars, further lowering the pH. Properly cured sauerkraut is sufficiently acidic to prevent a favorable environment for the growth of Clostridium botulinum, the toxins of which cause botulism.A 2004 genomic study found an unexpectedly large diversity of lactic acid bacteria in sauerkraut, and that previous studies had oversimplified this diversity. Weissella was found to be a major organism in the initial, heterofermentative stage, up to day 7. It was also found that Lactobacillus brevis and Pediococcus pentosaceus had smaller population numbers in the first 14 days than previous studies had reported.The Dutch sauerkraut industry found that inoculating a new batch of sauerkraut with an old batch resulted in an exceedingly sour product. This sourdough process is known as \"backslopping\" or \"inoculum enrichment\"; when used in making sauerkraut, first- and second-stage population dynamics, important to developing flavor, are bypassed. This is due primarily to the greater initial activity of species L. plantarum."

        "content": "In Azerbaijani, Belarusian, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Moravian, Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian cuisine, chopped cabbage is often pickled together with shredded carrots. Other ingredients may include caraway seeds, whole or quartered apples for additional flavor or cranberry for flavor and better keeping (the benzoic acid in cranberries is a common preservative). Bell peppers and beets are added in some recipes for color. The resulting sauerkraut salad is typically served cold, as zakuski or a side dish.\nA homemade type of very mild sauerkraut is available, where white cabbage is pickled with salt in a refrigerator for only three to seven days. This process results in very little lactic acid production. Sometimes in Russia double fermentation is used, with the initial step producing an exceptionally sour product, which is then \"corrected\" by adding 30-50% more fresh cabbage and fermenting the mix again. The flavor additives like apples, beets, cranberries, and sometimes even watermelons are usually introduced at this step.\nSauerkraut may be used as a filling for Polish pierogi, Ukrainian varenyky, Russian pirogi and pirozhki. Sauerkraut is also the central ingredient in traditional soups, such as shchi (a national dish of Russia), kwa\u015bnica (Poland), kapustnica (Slovakia), and zel\u0148a\u010dka (Czech Republic resp. Moravian). It is an ingredient of Polish bigos (a hunter's stew).In Ukraine, sauerkraut is known as \u043a\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430 (kysla kapusta) 'sour cabbage' or \u043a\u0432\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430 (kvashena kapusta) 'fermented cabbage'.\nIn Russia, sauerkraut is known as \u043a\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430 (kyslaya kapusta) 'sour cabbage' or \u043a\u0432\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430 (kvashenaya kapusta) 'fermented cabbage'.\nIn Germany and Austria, cooked sauerkraut is often flavored with juniper berries or caraway seeds; apples and white wine are added in popular variations. In South Tyrol, it is made with Juniper berries, Extra-virgin olive oil and smoked pancetta. Traditionally it is served warm, with pork (e.g. eisbein, schweinshaxe, Kassler) or sausages (smoked or fried sausages, Frankfurter W\u00fcrstchen, Vienna sausages, black pudding), accompanied typically by roasted or steamed potatoes or dumplings (kn\u00f6del or schupfnudel). Similar recipes are common in other Central European cuisines. The Czech national dish vep\u0159o knedlo zelo consists of roast pork with knedliky and sauerkraut.\nIn Bulgaria, Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia, North Macedonia and Slovenia, usually the whole cabbage heads are pickled. Such produce is used for many dishes, from a simple salad made of chopped cabbage and sprinkled with paprika, to cabbage rolls. In northern parts of Serbia and Croatia, it is often added to the bean soup. In central Serbia, a local specialty called \"wedding cabbage\" is made by slowly stewing roughly cut cabbage with at least three kinds of meats, lean, fatty, and smoked.\nIn Romania, the local type of sauerkraut (\"varza murata\" = whole pickled cabbage heads) are used as wrap for the national dish called \"Sarmale\", a Turkish-inspired roll, made of pickled cabbage leaves with minced pork and rice, having its own personality and very distinct in taste from its Ottoman predecessor.\nIn France, sauerkraut is the main ingredient of the Alsatian meal choucroute garnie (French for \"dressed sauerkraut\"), sauerkraut with sausages (Strasbourg sausages, smoked Morteau or Montb\u00e9liard sausages), charcuterie (bacon, ham, etc.), and often potatoes.\nIn Chile it is called chucrut and is a common topping for sandwiches and hotdogs, especially for completos.\nSauerkraut, along with pork, is eaten traditionally in Pennsylvania on New Year's Day. The tradition, started by the Pennsylvania Dutch, is thought to bring good luck for the upcoming year. Sauerkraut is also used in American cuisine as a condiment upon various foods, such as sandwiches and hot dogs. In Maryland, particularly in Baltimore and on the Eastern Shore, sauerkraut is a traditional accompaniment for the Thanksgiving turkey.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAs Europeans, especially Germans, emigrated to other countries, many of them continued making and eating sauerkraut around the world."

He supposedly visited Hotel Witt in Kalmar on May 4, 1862, where he wanted to treat his friends to a meal he used to eat in Russia. He ordered the ingredients needed from the kitchen, and the guests were instructed by Lindstr\u00f6m on how to make the patties.

Yeoh was keen to show that Asian food has just as much standing in the fine-dining circuit as other cuisines. The head chef is Alex Chow, while Yeoh continues to be the proprietor to this day.\nIn 2009, Kai Mayfair was awarded a Michelin Star, making it the only Chinese restaurant added to the 2009 Michelin List in the UK. It was also the first Chinese restaurant in London to be awarded a Michelin star, which the restaurant has retained ever since. Among its other awards include the Harden's Guide's award for Best Chinese Restaurant in London (2009 Edition) and the Zagat Survey's Best Chinese Restaurant in London for two years from 2003 - 2005. The restaurant also received nominations for Restaurant magazine's UK Best Dishes as well as Tatler magazine's Best Kitchen Awards in 2006.\nThe cuisine style has been described as 'Modern Chinese', which \"mixes tradition with innovation\", with the restaurant serving 'Liberated' Chinese cooking from the Nanyang region. The menu includes traditional, familiar dishes like prawn toast and sweet & sour pork but there are also many unfamiliar dishes like Nanyang chilli lobster and spring chicken & Sichuan spicy crumble, which is where the restaurant's \"true culinary personality can be found\", according to Yeoh's message at the start of the menu. The restaurant also offers an afternoon tea, available from 15:00 - 16:30 pm Wednesday to Sunday.\nKai Mayfair was dubbed \"home of the world's most expensive soup\" when it unveiled its \u00a3108 version of Buddha Jumps Over the Wall in 2005.

One month later, the company was registered as a joint-stock company according to German law under the company name of Mark's AG in the Commercial Register. In addition to Mark Korzilius, who served as the company's sole Management Board member, other investors were involved. The Italian architect and designer Matteo Thun contributed to the design. Among other elements, he came up with the interior design of the restaurant. At the end of 2003, the founder Mark Korzilius stepped down from his position as company Chairman, and the company was also renamed Vapiano AG. Based on the model of the original Hamburg location, the company opened additional restaurants, e.g. in 2004 in D\u00fcsseldorf as well as 2005 in Frankfurt, Nuremberg and Munich. New restaurants were also established in Hamburg.At the end of 2005, Vapiano moved its headquarters from Hamburg to Bonn. This was in connection with the opening of a restaurant in the Erich-Ollenhauer-Haus. In 2005, the company crossed the EUR 10 million threshold in revenue for the first time. From 2006, the company increasingly expanded abroad, e.g. to Belgium, Austria and Turkey. There was remarkable media reception marking the opening of the first restaurant in Vienna. Activities were also launched in Dubai and the United States. At the same time, Vapiano increasingly began cooperation with franchise partners in Europe. After continuous growth in the years 2006 and 2007, the number of restaurants in 2008 exceeded 30 and by the end of 2009 had already reached roughly 60. In 2011 in Vienna, Vapiano opened its 100th restaurant.Since September 2008, the company has been operating as Vapiano SE. In 2011, the private equity firm, Verm\u00f6gensverwaltung Mayfair, acquired 40 percent of the shares in Vapiano from Gregor Gerlach. Gerlach had invested in the company already in the start-up phase, acquired the shares of other shareholders and served as Chairman of the Supervisory Board. The equity position assumed by Mayfair, which according to Capital had even sought a majority, was intended above all to facilitate international growth. The Sander Family, heirs of Wella, had acquired shares in Vapiano in the meantime. The change in the shareholder structure led to the resignation of the longstanding Chairman Marko Silz, due to \"differing views\" concerning the future strategy. His successor was Gregor Gerlach, who continued to promote international expansion.After ten years in operation, the company had 118 restaurants and 7,200 employees worldwide, including 50 restaurants and 3,100 employees in Germany. In the 2010s, the company's success led to me-too competitors. In 2014, Vapiano altered its strategy and in smaller cities built new corporate-owned restaurants not run as franchise operations. The growth of the company slowed down,\n along with basic criticism of the company's expansion strategy in 2015. In mid-2015, Gregor Gerlach announced that he was moving from Chairman onto the Supervisory Board, in order to devote more efforts to other ventures. In addition to the Management Board, the Supervisory Board of Vapiano was also newly appointed.In 2017, Vapiano went public and at that time \"had a market value of about 553 million euros, or more than $630 million.\"In early 2019 the company was in financial trouble. Losses piled up after sales targets were missed, the share price had slumped by 75% since entering the stock market in 2017, and the company had expanded too quickly. As a result, the company decided to reduce the expansion tempo, have more locations operated by franchisees, alter the concept in order to reduce waiting times for customers and close unprofitable locations. In 2018 the company reported financial losses of \u20ac101 million. On 20 March 2020 the company filed for insolvency. The main reason was that losses had increased after almost all restaurants had to close temporarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The company officially entered insolvency proceedings on 2 April 2020 in Cologne.In June 2020, Vapiano was bought out of insolvency by a group of hospitality investors, led by Mario C. Bauer (former Board member, Vapiano). New investors include Henry McGovern (founder and ex-CEO of AmRest), Sinclair Beecham (Co-Founder Pret), Family van der Valk (Vapiano Netherlands and Belgium), and Gregor Gerlach (Founder of Vapiano)."

Self-service is an essential element of the Vapiano concept, but the company eschews the term \"fast-food restaurant\". The name Vapiano is derived from the Italian words va (\"go\") and piano (\"slowly\").

The distinguishing features of all the franchise restaurants are a long service counter, exposed-concrete floors, large wooden tables, basket lamps and Italian tile decor, along with a green wall consisting of real plants in the newest Vapianos. In addition, there is always an olive tree and an herb garden with basil and rosemary.Upon entering a restaurant, guests receive a chip card that keeps track of all the meals and drinks ordered; the guests hand in the chip card and pay for their orders when leaving the venue."

Working hours of works council chair members were said to have been reduced, and in addition, they were alleged to have been excluded from further training measures and relieved of responsibilities. Two works council chair members were even said to have been dismissed because the company claimed they had exerted pressure on the workforce. Vapiano issued a statement in this regard that the company had \"absolutely nothing against works councils\". A short time later, the Allgemeine Hotel- und Gastronomie-Zeitung, the weekly newspaper for the hotel and restaurant business in Germany, reported that the union and the company had approached one another and resumed discussions concerning the election of a works council.In June 2015, the company was subject to allegations that it had manipulated the records concerning the working hours of its employees, in order to push down wage costs. The German weekly newspaper Welt am Sonntag reported on former restaurant managers who claimed they had been instructed by their superiors to retroactively modify the time sheets of their employees and trainees. This was alleged to be standard practice in several Vapiano's corporate-run restaurants. According to estimates, the losses for employees were said to reach up to EUR 50,000 per year for each restaurant. Vapiano's Management Board was reportedly shocked by the allegations and spoke of \"criminal energy\". PricewaterhouseCoopers was hired to investigate the incidents, and the company also announced the introduction of a new system for time accounting.Also in 2015, \"Die Welt\" documented allegations by former employees, according to which best-by dates had been manipulated. \"Partly strange-smelling\" and \"no longer appetizing\" meals were said to have been served, also including pasta with a \"green shimmer\". In order to mask the disgusting odor of some products, employees are said to have been instructed to simply cook the food longer. Vapiano issued an apology for possible mistakes. The company said that, if the allegations were true, it was due to the \"misconduct of individual employees\". The company said it wanted to look into the allegations and cited its strict quality standards, including inspections by SGS Institut Fresenius and T\u00dcV Rheinland. The Bundesverband der Systemgastronomie, the German federal association for that type of industry, publicly defended Vapiano."

It is common to the cuisines of Central, Northern, Eastern and Southeastern Europe and much of Western Asia, Northern China, as well as parts of North Africa.\nMeat fillings are traditional in Europe, and include beef, lamb, or pork seasoned with garlic, onion, and spices. Grains such as rice and barley, mushrooms, and vegetables are often included as well. Fermented cabbage leaves are used for wrapping, particularly in southeastern Europe. In Asia, seafoods, tofu, and shiitake mushrooms or Vegeta may also be used. Chinese cabbage is often used as a wrapping.\nCabbage leaves are stuffed with the filling which are then baked, simmered, or steamed in a covered pot and generally eaten warm, often accompanied with a sauce. The sauce varies widely by cuisine. In Sweden and Finland, stuffed cabbage is served with lingonberry jam, which is both sweet and tart. In Central and Eastern Europe, tomato-based sauces and sour cream are typical. In Lebanon, the cabbage is stuffed with rice and minced meat and only rolled to the size of a cigar. It is usually served with a side dish of yogurt and a type of lemon and olive oil vinaigrette seasoned with garlic and dried mint.\nThe cabbage roll is a staple in the Romanian cuisine with variations of the recipe and sizing depending on the region, typically taking up to 6 hours to cook. Traditionally made with pork, beef, bacon, rice, spices and aromatics, broiled in a tomato sauce and served with polenta, sour cream and spicy pickled peppers.\nCooking textbook author Nancy Krcek stated that the origins are unclear and that it is possible multiple groups of people invented it at the same time. Another cooking book author Malgorzata Caprari stated it is believed that credit is owed to the poorer inhabitants of Central and Eastern European countries. Due to the widespread cultivation of cabbage in these regions, it is likely that the cultures who inhabited them were the original inventors of this dish.Cabbage rolls have found their way into popular culture, becoming one of the most recognizable dishes in Central and Eastern European cuisine. They often appear in literature and films as a symbol of homey comfort and tradition.\nA version called holishkes is traditionally eaten by Jews on Simchat Torah. Recipes vary depending on region; northern Poles prefer a savory sauce, while Galicia, Hungary and Ukraine favor sweet-and-sour, for example."

In terms of etymology palaw constitutes the classical pronunciation of Persian \u067e\u0644\u0627\u0648 wherein the sharp diphthong \"aw\" or /a\u028a/ is preserved.

It held three preview events\u2014a private event with local blues duo Curtis Salgado and Alan Hager on May 18, a multi-course seated dinner on May 19, and \"Sunday Jazz Brunch with Pete Krebs\" on May 20\u2014before opening to the public on May 22. The 80-seat restaurant replaced In Good Taste, a cooking school which occupied the space for eleven years and closed in February 2012. Its name (inspired by Louisiana's administrative divisions) was reflected by the restaurant's \"ecclesiastical\" interior, which included gray and pewter-colored \"cathedral-esque\" arches over the bar and a host stand which was a refurbished Prohibition-era Mississippi church pulpit.The Cajun, Louisiana Creole, and New Orleans-style seafood restaurant served entrees such as andouille, \u00e9touff\u00e9e, frog legs, jambalaya, maque choux, pork belly, and turtle soup, and was best known for its oysters. Its bar, Vieux Carr\u00e9 (French Quarter), served New Orleans cocktails including Bourbon-based drinks, daiquiris, and house infusions. The Parish's 4,000-square-foot (370 m2) interior, designed by Mark Annen, had a shucking station, oak floors, French-blue walls with gray accents, exposed brickwork, subway tiles, and salvaged woodwork.Hogan and Powell reportedly worked at both Eat and The Parish, switching daily. Like Eat, The Parish was a wholesale supplier of sustainably-farmed oysters to other Portland restaurants. Powell said about the difference between the two restaurants:\n\nWhen we were doing the oyster bar, we wanted a turn-of-the-20th-century, early-1900s style\u2014what you would find in Slidell, a po' boy shop with good gumbo and jambalaya, a little rowdy, where people consumed a lot of booze. The idea behind The Parish is to take it uptown, to the 1920s ... and (New Orleans') Garden District.\nIn July and August 2015, the restaurant was split in half, with one side serving brunch, lunch, and happy hour as the Palmetto Cafe. The 38-seat cafe's brunch menu included breakfast sandwiches, burritos, and pastries; its lunch menu included a fried green tomato sandwich with pimento cheese and coleslaw, po' boys, salads, and shrimp and grits. Fried chicken, kolaches, natchitoches meat pies, pimento cheeseburgers, seafood salads, and soft-boiled eggs were happy-hour menu items. In February 2016, the Palmetto was converted into a private event space and pop-up restaurant, and The Parish resumed serving lunch from 11:30 am to 3:00 pm on Fridays and Saturdays. The restaurant closed abruptly in September 2016, with little explanation."

In Italy it is recognized as a traditional agri-food product (PAT) of South Tyrol.The oldest strudel recipes (a Millirahmstrudel and a turnip strudel) are from 1696, in a handwritten cookbook at the Wienbibliothek im Rathaus (formerly Wiener Stadtbibliothek).

Other strudel types include sour cherry (Weichselstrudel), sweet cherry, nut filled (Nussstrudel), apricot strudel, plum strudel, poppy seed strudel (Mohnstrudel), rhubarb strudel and raisin strudel. There are also savoury strudels incorporating spinach, cabbage, potato, pumpkin, and sauerkraut, and versions containing meat fillings like the Lungenstrudel or Fleischstrudel.\nTraditional strudel pastry differs from puff pastry in that it is very elastic. It is made from flour with a high gluten content, water, oil and salt, with no sugar added. The dough is worked vigorously, rested, and then rolled out and stretched by hand very thinly with the help of a clean linen tea towel or kitchen paper. There are numerous techniques for manually pulling strudel dough. One method is to roll the dough thin before laying it over the back of the hands and drawing it thin by pulling the hands apart from one another. Purists say that it should be so thin that you can read a newspaper through it. A legend has it that the Austrian Emperor's perfectionist cook decreed that it should be possible to read a love letter through it. The thin dough is laid out on a tea towel, and the filling is spread on it. The dough with the filling on top is rolled up carefully with the help of the tea towel and baked in the oven."

Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is \"sushi rice\", also referred to as shari (\u3057\u3083\u308a), or sumeshi (\u9162\u98ef).The creator of modern sushi is believed to be Hanaya Yohei, who invented nigiri-zushi, a type of sushi most known today, in which seafood is placed on hand-pressed vinegared rice, around 1824 in the Edo period (1603\u20131867). It was the fast food of the ch\u014dnin class in the Edo period.Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.\nSushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a dish that consists of thinly sliced raw fish or occasionally meat, without sushi rice."

        "content": "The increasing popularity of sushi worldwide has resulted in variations typically found in the Western world but rarely in Japan. A notable exception to this is the use of salmon. The Japanese have eaten salmon since prehistory; however, caught salmon in nature often contains parasites and must be cooked or cured for its lean meat to be edible. On the other side of the world, in the 1960s and 1970s, Norwegian entrepreneurs started experimenting with aquaculture farming. The big breakthrough was when they figured out how to raise salmon in net pens in the sea. Being farm-raised, the Atlantic salmon reportedly showed advantages over the Pacific salmon, such as no parasites, easy animal capture, and could be grown with higher fat content. With government subsidies and improved techniques, they were so successful in raising fatty and parasite-free salmon they ended up with a surplus. Norway has a small population and limited market; therefore, they looked to other countries to export their salmon. The first Norwegian salmon was imported into Japan in 1980, accepted conventionally, for grilling, not for sushi. Salmon had already been consumed in North America as an ingredient in sushi as early as the 1970s. Salmon sushi did not become widely accepted in Japan until a successful marketing partnership in the late 1980s between Bjorn Eirik Olsen, a Norwegian businessman tasked with helping the Norwegian salmon industry glut, and the Japanese food supplier Nichirei.Other sushi creations to suit the Western palate were initially fueled by the invention of the California roll, a norimaki which presently almost always uses imitation crab (the original recipe calls for real cooked crab), along with avocado and cucumber. A wide variety of popular rolls (norimaki and uramaki) have evolved since. 'Norway roll' is another variant of uramakizushi filled with tamago (omelette), imitation crab and cucumber, rolled with shiso leaf and nori, topped with slices of Norwegian salmon, garnished with lemon and mayonnaise."

Frequent or significantly large consumption of methylmercury can lead to developmental defects when consumed by certain higher-risk groups, including women who are pregnant or may become pregnant, nursing mothers, and young children. A 2021 study in Catalonia, Spain reported that the estimated exposure to methylmercury in sushi consumption by adolescents exceeded the tolerable daily intake.A 2011 article reported approximately 18 million people infected with fish-borne flukes worldwide. Such an infection can be dangerous for expecting mothers due to the health risks that medical interventions or treatment measures may pose on the developing fetus. Parasitic infections can have a wide range of health impacts, including bowel obstruction, anemia, liver disease, and more. These illnesses' impact can pose health concerns for the expecting mother and baby.Sashimi or other types of sushi containing raw fish present a risk of infection by three main types of parasites:\n\nClonorchis sinensis, a fluke which can cause clonorchiasis\nAnisakis, a roundworm which can cause anisakiasis\nDiphyllobothrium, a tapeworm which can cause diphyllobothriasisFor these reasons, EU regulations forbid using raw fish that had not previously been frozen. It must be frozen at temperatures below \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F) in all product parts for no less than 24 hours. Fish for sushi may be flash frozen on fishing boats and by suppliers to temperatures as low as \u221260 \u00b0C (\u221276 \u00b0F). Super-freezing destroys parasites, and also prevents oxidation of the blood in tuna flesh that causes discoloration at temperatures above \u221220 \u00b0C (\u22124 \u00b0F).Calls for stricter analysis and regulation of seafood include improved product description. A 2021 DNA study in Italy found 30%\u201340% of fish species in sushi incorrectly described.Some forms of sushi, notably those containing the fugu pufferfish and some kinds of shellfish, can cause severe poisoning if not prepared properly. Fugu consumption, in particular, can be fatal. Fugu fish has a lethal dose of tetrodotoxin in its internal organs and, by law in many countries, must be prepared by a licensed fugu chef who has passed the prefectural examination in Japan. Licensing involves a written test, a fish-identification test, and a practical test that involves preparing the fugu and separating out the poisonous organs; only about 35 percent of applicants pass."

        "content": "Lahoh is traditionally and typically prepared from a thick batter of sorghum flour (preferred flour for making Laxoox), White cornmeal/cornflour, warm water, yeast, and a pinch of salt. The mixture is beaten by hand until soft and creamy. The batter is then left to ferment overnight to cook and then eat for breakfast. There is a sweet-tasting variety of the dish, one made with eggs, as well as another variety that is spiced and typically eaten in Somali households at breakfast during Eid called Cambaabuur (Ambaabuur).\nIt is traditionally baked on a metallic circular stove called a taawa. Lacking that, it can also be baked in an ordinary pan.\nSomali laxoox/canjeero is a pancake-like flatbread, i.e., made from a batter comprised typically of legumes or cereals other than wheat, usually due to a scarcity of wheat production. The modern-day production of Somali laxoox/canjeero is relatively homogenous, but recent research revealed two significant divergences: in bread formulation and in the procedure for structure development. These divergences correspond broadly to regional differences in production methods. An original framework of four production styles (\u201cheritage,\u201d \u201cnew heritage,\u201d \u201cinnovative,\u201d and \u201cglobal\u201d) illustrates these divergences in detail.In (greater) Somalia, gluten-like structure development in laxoox/canjeero historically relied on cajiin (Fig. 5), a pre-gelatinized dough made from sorghum (and/or other non-glutinous or low-gluten grains) and hot water in a manual process involving 1 to 2 days of intermittent activity. Hydrothermal treatment changes protein and starch properties, causing starch to gelatinize and conferring hydrocolloid properties which mimic gluten. Gelatinized starch provides the batter with gas-holding capacity which improves the stability of the dough and the flexibility of the resulting bread. Thus, cajiin was fundamental to achieving the desired texture in laxoox/canjeero made from low-gluten or gluten-free flours, such as sorghum. In the late twentieth century, industrial-grade kneading/sheeting machines were introduced in cities including Mogadishu, Hargeisa, Burao, Baidoa, and Warsheikh to produce commercial quantities of cajiin dough. This greatly reduced labor for household cooks, however, only a handful of machines remain; those in Somaliland cities were destroyed or dismantled during conflict leading up to Somalia's civil war and never replaced. Per a 2019 survey, canjeero production in southern Somalia and parts of Puntland includes the use of cajiin, while its use in Somaliland and Ethiopia's Somali State has ceased.\nLaxoox/canjeero is commonly prepared using long fermentation, typically overnight for consumption at breakfast. Some cooks enhance fermentation using a microbial starter known as dhanaanis, which speeds fermentation. Cooks may manipulate the type or quantity dhanaanis or other fermentation agent (such as commercial yeast) in response to temperature changes or adjust the fermentation period.\nWhile canjeero in Somalia is frequently prepared only with refined white flour and corn flour, laxoox in Somaliland and Ethiopia's Somali State is typically prepared with multiple dry ingredients including sorghum, maize, barley, teff, and pulses such as cowpea and adzuki beans in addition to herbs and spices to taste."

        "content": "Somali and Yemeni laxoox/lahoh bread is artisinal and therefore not standardized. The breadmaking process in Yemen and Somaliland is largely similar for laxoox/lahoh, including the selection of ingredients, fermentation steps, and baking, as well as the ways in which household technologies domesticated in Yemen and Somaliland in the last century (e.g., blenders, refrigeration) have given rise to new techniques. However, differences are observable. In the fermentation stage, while the use of pre-gelatinized dough in the initial sourdough batch fell out of favor circa the 1980s in Somaliland, it continues to be used in Yemen. In both locations, long fermentation and a microbial starter are used in subsequent batches. Other differences are readily identifiable, especially at the baking stage. Somaliland baking tools (e.g., taawa/daawa of a certain diameter, flat-bottomed plastic cups to pour and spread the batter across the pan, and butter knives to lift the cooked bread from the pan) are consistent across households. In Yemen, by contrast, the baking pan size differs drastically depending on the number of people to serve and on commercial versus household production. In the finished product, apart from differences in size, a spiral pattern is characteristic of Somaliland laxoox, whereas this pattern appears inconsistently in Yemeni lahoh.\nCooked laxoox/canjeero and Yemeni lahoh retain a soft, puffed side that never contacts the griddle (taawa or daawa) surface but rather rises via steam under a well-fitting lid; and a browned side that cooks on the oiled griddle and is crispy when just cooked but quickly softens. The flatbread is pockmarked with holes, or \u201ceyes,\u201d and appears translucent when held up to a light source. A 2022 study of laxoox and lahoh breads gathered from Somaliland and Yemen as well as from Yemeni households in Hargeisa showed that the breads had porous structures with a cell density varying from 22.4 to 57.4 cells/cm2 in the Somali laxoox, while one of the two Yemeni lahoh reached 145 cells/cm2.\nThe 2022 study showed that the bioactive content and the antioxidant activity of Somali laxoox and Yemeni laxoox breads significantly varied among households and baking batches due to the natural variability of manual food preparation, as well as in the recipes and compositions of raw materials used. Total carotenoids were highest (22.58 mg \u03b2-carotene/kg) in red sorghum flour, where anthocyanins were also found (0.32 mg cyanidin 3-O-glucoside/g), but markedly decreased by adding refined wheat flour, indicating that the use of refined wheat flour has negative effects on the content of bioactive compounds.\nIn the same study, a principal component analysis (PCA) underlined the main features that distinguish the laxoox breads from both of the Yemeni lahoh samples, although a Sanaa'ani style lahoh bread, representative of ordinary flatbread production in Yemen, was similar to the laxoox main group. In contrast, a flatbread sourced from Aruuq, Yemen was highly unique."

In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork. In casual settings, however, it is typically cut into slices to be eaten while held in the hand. Pizza is also sold in grocery stores in a variety of forms, including frozen or as kits for self-assembly.

In the 6th century BC, the Persian soldiers of the Achaemenid Empire during the rule of Darius the Great baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of their battle shields and the ancient Greeks supplemented their bread with oils, herbs, and cheese. An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the Aeneid, when Celaeno, queen of the Harpies, foretells that the Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book VII, Aeneas and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables. When they eat the bread, they realize that these are the \"tables\" prophesied by Celaeno. In 2023, archeologists discovered a fresco in Pompeii appearing to depict a pizza-like dish among other foodstuffs and staples on a silver platter. Italy's culture minister said it \"may be a distant ancestor of the modern dish\". The first mention of the word pizza comes from a notarial document written in Latin and dating to May 997 AD from Gaeta, demanding a payment of \"twelve pizzas, a pork shoulder, and a pork kidney on Christmas Day, and 12 pizzas and a couple of chickens on Easter Day\".Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century. Before that time, flatbread was often topped with ingredients such as garlic, salt, lard, and cheese. It is uncertain when tomatoes were first added and there are many conflicting claims, though it certainly could not have been before the 16th century and the Columbian Exchange. Pizza was sold from open-air stands and out of pizza bakeries until about 1830, when pizzerias in Naples started to have stanze with tables where clients could sit and eat their pizzas on the spot.A popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, pizza Margherita, was invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo (pizza maker) Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three different pizzas he created, the Queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed in the colors of the Italian flag\u2014red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella). Supposedly, this kind of pizza was then named after the Queen, with an official letter of recognition from the Queen's \"head of service\" remaining to this day on display in Esposito's shop, now called the Pizzeria Brandi. Later research cast doubt on this legend, undermining the authenticity of the letter of recognition, pointing that no media of the period reported about the supposed visit and that both the story and name Margherita were first promoted in the 1930s\u20131940s.Pizza was taken to the United States by Italian immigrants in the late nineteenth century and first appeared in areas where they concentrated. The country's first pizzeria, Lombardi's, opened in New York City in 1905. Following World War II, veterans returning from the Italian Campaign, who were introduced to Italy's native cuisine, proved a ready market for pizza in particular.The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (lit.\u2009'True Neapolitan Pizza Association') is a non-profit organization founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples that aims to promote traditional Neapolitan pizza. In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish, and in 2017 the art of its making was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage."

The choice of spices for each dish in traditional cuisine depends on regional cultural tradition and personal preferences. Such dishes have names that refer to their ingredients, spicing, and cooking methods. Outside the Indian subcontinent, a curry is a dish from Southeast Asia which uses coconut milk or spice pastes, commonly eaten over rice. Curries may contain fish, meat, poultry, or shellfish, either alone or in combination with vegetables. Others are vegetarian. Dry curries are cooked using small amounts of liquid, which is allowed to evaporate, leaving the other ingredients coated with the spice mixture. Wet curries contain significant amounts of sauce or gravy based on broth, coconut cream or coconut milk, dairy cream or yogurt, or legume pur\u00e9e, saut\u00e9ed crushed onion, or tomato pur\u00e9e.\nCurry powder, a commercially prepared mixture of spices marketed in the West, was first exported to Britain in the 18th century when Indian merchants sold a concoction of spices, similar to garam masala, to the British East India Company returning to Britain."

Archaeological evidence dating to 2600 BCE from Mohenjo-daro also suggests the use of mortar and pestle to pound spices including mustard, fennel, cumin, and tamarind  pods with which they flavoured food. Black pepper is native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia and has been known to Indian cooking since at least 2000 BCE.The three basic ingredients of the spicy stew were ginger, garlic, and turmeric. Using a method called \"starch grain analysis\", archaeologists identified the residue of these spices in both skeletons and pottery shards from excavations in India, finding that turmeric and ginger were present.The establishment of the Mughal Empire, in the early 16th century, also influenced some curries, especially in the north. Another influence was the establishment of the Portuguese trading centre in Goa in 1510, resulting in the introduction of chili pepper, tomatoes and potatoes to India from the Americas, as a byproduct of the Columbian Exchange.The British lumped all sauce-based dishes under the generic name 'curry'. It was introduced to English cuisine from Anglo-Indian cooking in the 17th century, as spicy sauces were added to plain boiled and cooked meats. Curry was first served in coffee houses in Britain from 1809, and has been increasingly popular in Great Britain, with major jumps in the 1940s and the 1970s. During the 19th century, curry was carried to the Caribbean by Indian indentured workers in the British sugar industry.

Although the formation mechanism of chemical composition in soy sauce is complex, it has been widely accepted that free amino acids, water-soluble peptides and Maillard reaction products in soy sauce are considered as essential chemical composition and to provide core sensory effects. \nThe primary fermentation of lactic-acid-fermenting halophiles lowers the pH of the moromi, and this directly results in the acidic pH range (4.4\u20135.4) of soy sauce products. The secondary fermentation conducted by heterofermentative microbes provides soy sauce with a wide range of flavor and odorant compounds by breaking down macronutrients. Soy proteins and grain proteins are hydrolyzed into short peptide chains and free amino acids, which adds umami to the product. Based on the result of free amino acid analysis, the most abundant amino acids in Chinese soy sauce product are glutamic acid, aspartic acid, alanine and leucine.Starch is hydrolyzed into simple sugars which contribute to the sweet flavor in soy sauce. Legume fats may also be decomposed into short chain fatty acids, and the interactions among lipids and other macronutrients also result in a richer flavor in the final product. Non-enzymatic browning also contributes significantly to the development of the properties of soy sauce. The hydrolysis of proteins and large carbohydrates also provides free amino acids and simple sugars as reagents for the Maillard reaction.\nSoy sauce may contain more than 1% alcohol and may run afoul of liquor control legislation."

        "content": "The taste of soy sauce is predominated by saltiness, followed by moderate umami, sweet taste, and finally slight bitterness, which is hard to perceive due to the masking effect of other tastes. The overall flavor of soy sauce is a result of the balance and interaction among different taste components. The saltiness is largely attributed to the presence of NaCl (common salt) in brine. The sugars hydrolyzed from starch add sweetness into soy sauce. Umami is largely caused by the presence of free amino acids, mainly glutamine and aspartic acid. Sodium from the brine and disodium ribonucleotides from the soy also add to the umami. Other amino acids cause additional basic flavors, with sweet coming from Ala, Gly, Ser, and Thr; bitter coming from Arg, His, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, Trp, Tyr, and Val; and no taste in Cys, Lys, and Pro. The amino-acid nitrogen content, an indication of the free amino acid concentration, is used in China for grading soy sauce. The highest \"special grade\" is defined at \u2265 0.8 g/100 mL.Despite a large variety of volatile and odorant compounds that have been identified in soy sauce, the food product per se does not present a strong aroma. Alcohols, acids, esters, aldehydes, ketones, phenols, heterocyclic compounds, alkynes and benzenes have been identified in Chinese soy sauces. An explanation for this observation is that the aroma of soy sauce does not depend largely on the aroma-active compounds. The subtle aroma is a result of a \"critical balance\" achieved among all volatile and odorant compounds, whose respective concentrations are relatively low."

The Spanish paella, and the South Asian pilau or pulao, and biryani, evolved from such dishes.\nAccording to author K. T. Achaya, the Indian epic Mahabharata mentions an instance of rice and meat cooked together. Also, according to Achaya, \"pulao\" or \"pallao\" is used to refer to a rice dish in ancient Sanskrit works such as the Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya Sm\u1e5bti. However, according to food writers Colleen Taylor Sen and Charles Perry, and social theorist Ashis Nandy, these references do not substantially correlate to the commonly used meaning and history implied in pilafs, which appear in Indian accounts after the medieval Central Asian conquests.Similarly Alexander the Great and his army, many centuries earlier, in the 4th century BCE, have been reported to be so impressed with Bactrian and Sogdian pilavs that his soldiers brought the recipes back to Macedonia when they returned. Similar stories exist of Alexander introducing pilaf to Samarkand; however, they are considered apocryphal by art historian John Boardman. Similarly, it has been reported that pilaf was consumed in the Byzantine Empire and in the Republic of Venice.The earliest documented recipe for pilaf comes from the tenth-century Persian scholar Avicenna (Ibn S\u012bn\u0101), who in his books on medical sciences dedicated a whole section to preparing various dishes, including several types of pilaf. In doing so, he described the advantages and disadvantages of every item used for preparing the dish. Accordingly, Persians consider Ibn Sina to be the \"father\" of modern pilaf. Thirteenth-century Arab texts describe the consistency of pilaf that the grains should be plump and somewhat firm to resemble peppercorns with no mushiness, and each grain should be separate with no clumping.Another primary source for pilaf dishes comes from the 17th-century Iranian philosopher Molla Sadra.Pilau became standard fare in the Middle East and Transcaucasia over the years with variations and innovations by the Persians, Arabs, Turks, and Armenians.\nDuring the period of the Soviet Union, the Central Asian versions of the dish spread throughout all Soviet republics, becoming a part of the common Soviet cuisine."

There are Dutch archives about Minangkabau that state regular contacts between India and West Sumatra in the early second millennium, thus suggests that north Indian curry was possibly the precursor of rendang. Indian curry was adopted by the Minangkabau people as gulai, a local version of curry. Minangkabau people then cooked this gulai further in order to prepare kalio also known as wet rendang. This cooking process was then continued until it thickened and became rendang or also known as dry rendang.Andalas University historian, Prof. Gusti Asnan suggests that rendang began to spread across the region when Minangkabau merchants began to trade and migrate to Malacca in the 16th century, \"Because the journey through the river waterways in Sumatra took much time, a durable preserved dry rendang is suitable for a long journey.\" The dried Padang rendang is a durable food, good to consume for weeks, even when left at room temperature. One of the earliest written records of rendang is from the Malaccan Malay manuscript of Hikayat Amir Hamzah, \nRendang originated in the Sumatran Minangkabau region and the making of rendang spreads from Minangkabau highlands to Mandailing, Riau, Jambi, across the strait to Malacca and Negeri Sembilan, resulting in a variety of rendang traditions.During the Indonesian National Revolution in 1946, the Indonesian First Lady Fatmawati, the wife of Sukarno, cooked and sent rendang to boost the morale of Indonesian republic freedom fighters around Yogyakarta. Declined by household helps, she insisted on buying beef and went to the market herself by becak, despite being pregnant at the time.The popularity of rendang has spread widely from its original domain because of the marantau (migrating) culture of Minangkabau people. In the modern era, Overseas Minangkabau leave their hometown to start a career in other Indonesian cities as well as neighboring countries, and Padang restaurants, Minangkabau eating establishments that are ubiquitous in Indonesian cities, spring up. These Padang restaurants have introduced and popularized Minangkabau style rendang and other Padang food dishes across Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the wider world."

It has been claimed that the four main ingredients represent Minangkabau society as a whole:\nThe meat (daging) symbolises the Niniak Mamak, the traditional clan leaders such as the datuk, the nobles, royalty, and revered elders.\nThe coconut milk (karambia) symbolises the Cadiak Pandai, intellectuals, teachers, poets, and writers.\nThe chilli (lado) symbolises the Alim Ulama, clerics, ulama and religious leaders. The hotness of the chilli symbolises Sharia.\nThe spice mixture (pemasak) symbolises the rest of Minangkabau society.In Minangkabau tradition, rendang is a requisite dish for special occasions in traditional Minang ceremonies, from birth ceremonies to circumcision, marriage, Qur'an recitals, and religious festivals such as Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha.In 2011, rendang placed 11th place on a list of World's 50 best foods published by CNN International. An online reader's poll of 35,000 voters chose beef rendang as the top dish on CNN International's Readers' picks list.\nThe Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture have included six rendang preparations under its National Intangible Cultural Heritage of Indonesia list, all of which are registered under West Sumatra: Randang (Minang spelling), and gulai rendang, were part of the inaugural list in 2010. They were joined by randang daging (meat rendang), randang kantang (potato rendang), and randang incek kacang, in 2016. Rendang paku (fern rendang) of Dharmasraya, is the most recent addition as of 2018.In 2018, rendang was officially recognised by the Indonesian government as one of the country's five national dishes: the others are soto, sate, nasi goreng, and gado-gado."

        "content": "Rendang is most often described as meat slow-cooked in coconut milk and spices until it becomes tender. If cooked properly, dry rendang can last for as long as four weeks. Prior to refrigeration technology, this style of cooking enabled preservation of the large amount of meat. The cooking technique flourished because of its role in preserving meat in a tropical climate. Its durability is one of the reasons that today, prepackaged rendang is sent as food aid relief for natural disaster survivors in Indonesia. The cut of beef suitable for rendang is lean meat of the rear leg of the cattle; i.e. topside or round beef, which is considered perfect for slow cooking.Rendang is rich in spices. Along with the main meat ingredient, rendang uses coconut milk and a paste of mixed ground spices, including ginger, galangal, turmeric leaves, lemongrass, garlic, shallots, chillis and other spices. This spice mixture is called pemasak in Minangkabau. The spices, garlic, shallot, ginger and galangal used in rendang have antimicrobial properties and serve as natural organic preservatives. Although some culinary experts describe rendang as a curry, the dish is usually not considered as such in Indonesia or Malaysia since it is richer and contains less liquid than is normal for curries.Traditionally the term rendang does not refer to a certain type of dish. The verb merendang actually refers to a method of slow cooking; continuously churning the ingredients in a pot or frying pan, on a small fire, until all of the liquids evaporate and the meat is well done. Traditional Padang rendang takes hours to cook. Cooking rendang involves pounding and grinding ingredients as well as slow cooking, and so is time-consuming and requires patience. The meat pieces are slowly cooked in coconut milk and spices until almost all the liquid is gone, allowing the meat to become tender and absorb the condiments. The cooking process changes from boiling to frying, as the liquid evaporates and the coconut milk turns to coconut oil. Cooking the meat until tender with almost all the liquid evaporated requires great care, keeping it from getting burnt. Because of its generous use of numerous spices, rendang is known for having a complex and unique taste.\nRendang is often served with steamed rice, ketupat (a compressed rice cake) or lemang (glutinous rice cooked in bamboo tubes), accompanied with vegetable side dishes such as boiled cassava leaf, cubadak (young jackfruit gulai), cabbage gulai and lado (red or green chilli pepper sambal).\n\nStages of rendang cooking"

        "content": "In Minangkabau culinary tradition, there are three recognised stages in cooking meat in spicy coconut milk. The dish which results is categorised according to the liquid content of the cooked coconut milk, which ranges from the most wet and soupy to the most dry: Gulai \u2014 Kalio \u2013 Rendang. The ingredients of gulai, kalio and rendang are almost identical with the exceptions that gulai usually has less red chilli pepper and more turmeric, while rendang has richer spices.\nIf pieces of meat are cooked in spicy coconut milk and the process stopped right when the meat is done and the coconut milk has reached its boiling point, the dish is called gulai. If the process continues until the coconut milk is partly evaporated and the meat has started to brown, the dish is called kalio. For traditional dry rendang, the process continues hours beyond this, until the liquid has all but completely evaporated and the color turns to a dark brown, almost black color. Thus not only liquid content but also color indicate which type of rendang is involved: gulai is light yellow, kalio is brown and rendang is very dark brown. Today, one mostly finds only two simpler categories of rendang: either dry or wet.\nAccording to Minangkabau tradition, their true rendang is the dry one. Although, unlike crispy dendeng balado spicy jerky, rendang's texture is not actually dry, since it is quite moist and rather oily. Rendang is diligently stirred, attended, and cooked for hours until the coconut milk has evaporated, turned into coconut oil, and the meat has absorbed the spices. It is still served for special ceremonial occasions or to honor guests. If cooked properly, dried rendang can last for three to four weeks stored at room temperature and is still good to consume. It can even last months stored in a refrigerator, and up to six months if frozen."

Chicken or duck rendang also contains tamarind and is usually not cooked for as long as beef rendang.The original Minangkabau rendang has two categories, rendang darek and rendang pesisir. Rendang darek (\u2018land rendang\u2019) is an umbrella term for dishes from old regions in mountainous areas of the Minangkabau Highlands such as Batusangkar, Agam, Lima Puluh Kota, Payakumbuh, Padang Panjang and Bukittinggi.

The cattle intestine rendang is quite similar with gulai tambusu, gulai iso or gulai usus.Today, rendang is quite widespread in Indonesia, owned mainly by the proliferation of Padang restaurants in the country, which led to popularity and adoption of rendang\ninto the kitchens of contemporary Indonesian households of various ethnic backgrounds. This might led to development of variants with slightly altered tastes to accommodate regional preferences. Other ethnic groups in Indonesia also have adopted a version of rendang into their daily diet. For example, in Java, the rendang\u2014aside from the Padang variety sold in Padang restaurants\u2014tend to be wet, slightly sweeter and less spicy to accommodate Javanese tastes."

        "content": "This chain of Tex-Mex restaurants was started by Texas-based DF&R Restaurants Inc. in 1985. After a period of rapid growth throughout the state of Texas, Don Pablo's began to build new locations in the Midwest.By 1995, DF&R had 51 Don Pablo's locations which led Madison, Georgia-based Apple South to notice the chain's successful growth and to purchase DF&R later that year. At the time of the purchase, Apple South was one of the largest franchise holders in the Applebee's restaurant system with 170 Applebee's restaurants, and operated restaurants from other franchise chains, most of which were located in the South and Midwest. Two years later, Apple South decided to divest all of its 264 Applebee's franchises (in a franchise system that had 960 units), along with its other franchise properties, to focus its efforts on the 120-unit Don Pablo's and the other company-owned chains. Shortly after the Applebee's restaurant divestiture, Apple South changed its name to Avado Brands to emphasise the change of business.Things did not go as well as Avado had originally planned, and it filed for bankruptcy in 2004. At that time, it had 106 Don Pablo's. Avado exited bankruptcy a year later with 96 Don Pablo's in operation. After spending two years trying to revitalize the brand, Avado filed for bankruptcy for the second time in September 2007 and subsequently closed or sold about half of its 90 locations.In February 2008, 41 Don Pablo's locations were acquired by Rita Restaurant Corporation of Madison, Georgia, a fully owned subsidiary of DDJ Capital Management of Waltham, Massachusetts. Rita tried to revitalize the brand by closing under-performing locations and selling franchises. A franchise was sold to a Florida-based operator who re-opened a Don Pablo's in Sarasota, Florida, in 2012. The Sarasota location was the sole remaining franchise until it was finally closed in 2015.In 2014, the 34-unit chain was acquired by San Antonio-based Food Management Partners (FMP). FMP is also a franchise operator of Buffalo Wild Wings and several Italian restaurant chains. While FMP owned the company, locations were closed in February 2014 at Atlanta, Georgia; in August 2014 at Hobart, Indiana; in February 2015 at Canton, Ohio; in April 2015 at Flint, Michigan; in February 2016 at Greenville, South Carolina and Maple Grove, Minnesota; in August 2016 at Richfield, Minnesota and Newport, Kentucky; and in September 2016 at Beavercreek, Ohio and Owings Mills, Maryland.On October 4, 2016, Rita Restaurant Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after nearly cutting the number of Don Pablo's locations in half. At the time of the bankruptcy announcement, all four Indianapolis-area locations along with locations in Battle Creek, Michigan and Toledo, Ohio were immediately closed with little advance warning. At the time of the bankruptcy filing, there were 12 restaurants remaining. By November 2016, the Alexandria, Virginia location quietly disappeared from the Don Pablo's website. The Eden Prairie, Minnesota location quietly disappeared from the Don Pablo's website sometime between February and July 2017. The contents of the Eden Prairie restaurant were auctioned off in March. The Shelby Charter Township, Michigan location disappeared from the Don Pablo's website sometime between July 8 and July 19. In February 2018, the Don Pablo's location in Lafayette, Indiana quietly closed to leave 8 locations.In April 2018, the Grand Prairie, Texas location quietly closed its doors to leave the number of locations at 7 by May 2018.In July 2018, the Norwood, Ohio location closed its doors to leave a total number of 6 locations in Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, and Texas. In September 2018, the Christiana, Delaware restaurant was closed, leaving just 5 restaurants in three states.In early November 2018, the Moorestown, New Jersey, restaurant closed for the final time and about the same time, the listing for the Fort Worth, Texas, restaurant disappeared from the Don Pablo's website to leave three locations. Just two and a half weeks later, the location at White Marsh Mall in Baltimore County, the last location in Maryland, was closed just days before Thanksgiving while the last Don Pablo's restaurant in Texas also disappeared from the website, leaving Deptford Township, New Jersey as the last one in business. The Deptford location finally closed in June 2019."

Lamb, and, sometimes, horse meat was used to make a triangular pie. An opening on the top was used to add broth immediately before eating which made it a hot meal.

It is differentiated from a torta by its filling: a crostata has an inconsistent chunky filling, whereas a torta has a consistent filling made of blended ingredients. There are \"endless variations\" of both sweet and savoury crostata, the sweet ones usually being served as a dessert.\nSweet variations use fruit preserves as a filling, typically apricot, cherry, peach or nectarine, or berries. The crostata can also be blind-baked and then filled with pastry cream (crema pasticciera) topped with pieces of fresh fruit; this is called crostata di frutta. In his 1570 cookbook Opera dell'arte del cucinare, Bartolomeo Scappi included a recipe for a crostata of plums and sour cherries, and others for quince, and pears. A modern version is crostata alla nutella, which has Nutella as the filling.Ingredients for a savoury crostata may include meat, fish, or vegetables, which are pre-cooked. Opera dell'arte del cucinare included a recipe for a \"crostata of crabmeat and shrimp\", and also stated that to instead make a torta, the shrimp and crab should be crushed. A popular sweet variant, especially in central Italy, is crostata di ricotta, made with ricotta mixed with sugar and lemon zest, and which may additionally include cocoa or raisins.Scappi included many recipes for crostata in Opera dell'arte del cucinare. For meat and seafood based crostata, there were recipes using pork jowls or prosciutto, crayfish, anchovies, or oysters. Other savoury crostata recipes included a crostata with creamy cheese referred to as a butirata, those with truffles or field mushrooms, one with artichoke or cardoon hearts, and one with \"the viscera of any sort of turtle\"."

The pudding is unique in that it contains bacon and a very large number of egg yolks \u2014 fifteen in total. According to its creator, \"The pudding is rather easy to make, but difficult to get right.\"In 2011, the Abbot of Priscos pudding was one of the runners-up in the Seven Wonders of Portuguese Gastronomy competition."

        "content": "Krupuk (Javanese) is a cracker made from starch or animal skin and other ingredients that serve as flavouring. Most krupuk are deep fried, while some others are grilled or hot sand fried. They are popular snacks in maritime Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, and Philippines), most closely associated with the culinary traditions of Indonesia, in particular Javanese cuisine. It is a ubiquitous staple in its country of origin and has spread to other countries either via the migration of diaspora populations or exports."

        "content": "Krupuk in Javanese means \"fried side dish\" (made of flour, mixed with other ingredients). The word was later absorbed into other languages and stylized according to local pronunciations. In Indonesia and the modern states of Brunei, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines, krupuk is known under a general name with minor phonetic variations. It is called \"kerupuk\" in Indonesian, while in Malay, it is \"keropok\". In Dutch, it is \"kroepoek\" (\"oe\" being equivalent to \"u\"), which was also the original spelling prior to the establishment of modern Indonesia and post-independence spelling reform.\nThe Javanese onomatopoeia for the sound of crunchy foods (krauk for a big crunch; kriuk for a small crunch) is believed to have inspired the name. It might have also inspired the naming of kripik, a different type of Javanese cracker."

        "content": "According to culinary historian Fadly Rahman, krupuk had existed in Java since the 9th or 10th century. It was written in the Batu Pura Inscription as krupuk rambak, which refers to crackers made from cow or buffalo skin, that still exist today as krupuk kulit (\"skin krupuk\") and are usually used in a Javanese dish called krechek. In its development, krupuk spread across the archipelago, and the taste varies according to the ingredients. From Java, krupuk spread to various coastal areas of Kalimantan, Sumatra, to the Malay Peninsula. It is produced and consumed in various varieties and is an integral part of the national cuisines of several Southeast Asian countries. Kroepoek also can be found in the Netherlands, through their historic colonial ties with Indonesia.Today, krupuk has been one of the food-product export commodities of Indonesia, reaching foreign markets including Thailand, China, South Korea, the United States, Mexico, and the European Union."

        "content": "To achieve maximum crunchiness, most of this pre-packed raw krupuk must be sun-dried first before being deep fried at home. To cook krupuk, a wok with plenty of high-temperature cooking oil is needed. A healthier, fatless version might be made by briefly pulsing the raw krupuk in the microwave oven: usually one minute at the medium (~700W) power is enough to successfully puff a handful of chips. Raw krupuk is quite small, hard, and darker in color than the cooked one.Krupuk and kripik can be consumed alone as a snack or cracked and garnished on top of foods for a complementary, crisp texture. Certain Indonesian dishes such as gado-gado, karedok, rujak, asinan, bubur ayam and certain kinds of soto require a certain type of krupuk for toppings. It is an essential ingredient to make seblak, a savoury-spicy dish made of boiled, wet krupuk cooked with protein (chicken, beef, or seafood), all in a spicy sauce."

        "content": "In Indonesia, major production centres of krupuk are usually coastal fishing towns. Sidoarjo in East Java, Cirebon in West Java, Karimun Jawa island, Padang, Palembang and Medan in Sumatra, Bangka Island, Samarinda and Pontianak in Kalimantan, and Makassar in Sulawesi are major producers of krupuk, and many recipes originate from there.\nSome inland towns are also famous as krupuk production centres, such as Bandung, Garut and Malang. Although they usually do not produce seafood-based krupuk as their coastal town counterparts. Most krupuk producers traditionally are modest home industries. However, today there is a dilemma among krupuk factories, whether to shift to automation through modern machinery but have to lay-off some of their workers, or continue producing in traditional ways but lack in producing capacity.Most of the coastal towns in Malaysia such as Mukah, Malacca Town, Pangkor Island and Lumut produce keropok from large scale manufacturing to small scale home factories."
