        "content": "The Chrysler Building is an Art Deco skyscraper in the Turtle Bay neighborhood on the East Side of Manhattan, New York City, at the intersection of 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. At , it is the tallest brick building in the world with a steel framework, and was the world's tallest building for 11 months after its completion in 1930. , the Chrysler is the 11th-tallest building in the city, tied with The New York Times Building. Originally a project of real estate developer and former New York State Senator William H. Reynolds, the building was constructed by Walter Chrysler, the head of the Chrysler Corporation. The construction of the Chrysler Building, an early skyscraper, was characterized by a competition with 40 Wall Street and the Empire State Building to become the world's tallest building. Although the Chrysler Building was built and designed specifically for the car manufacturer, the corporation did not pay for its construction and never owned it; Walter Chrysler decided to fund the entire cost personally so his children could inherit it. An annex was completed in 1952, and the building was sold by the Chrysler family the next year, with numerous subsequent owners. When the Chrysler Building opened, there were mixed reviews of the building's design, ranging from views of it as inane and unoriginal to the idea that it was modernist and iconic. Perceptions of the building have slowly evolved into its now being seen as a paragon of the Art Deco architectural style; and in 2007, it was ranked ninth on the List of America's Favorite Architecture by the American Institute of Architects. The building was designated a New York City landmark in 1978, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark in 1976."

The land was donated to The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in 1902. The site is roughly a trapezoid with a  frontage on Lexington Avenue; a  frontage on 42nd Street; and a  frontage on 43rd Street. The site bordered the old Boston Post Road, which predated, and ran aslant of, the Manhattan street grid established by the Commissioners' Plan of 1811. As a result, the east side of the building's base is similarly aslant. The Grand Hyatt New York hotel and the Graybar Building are across Lexington Avenue, while the Socony\u2013Mobil Building is across 42nd Street. In addition, the Chanin Building is to the southwest, diagonally across Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street."

        "content": "In the mid-1920s, New York's metropolitan area surpassed\u00a0London's as the world's most populous metropolitan area and its population exceeded ten million by the early 1930s. The era was characterized by profound social and technological changes. Consumer goods such as radio, cinema, and the automobile became widespread.\u00a0In 1927, Walter Chrysler's automotive company, the Chrysler Corporation, became the third-largest car manufacturer in the United States, behind\u00a0Ford and\u00a0General Motors. The following year, Chrysler was named Time\u00a0magazine's \"Person of the Year\". The economic boom of the 1920s and speculation in the real estate market fostered a wave of new skyscraper projects in New York City. The Chrysler Building was built as part of an ongoing building boom that resulted in the city having the world's tallest building from 1908 to 1974. Following the end of World War I, European and American architects came to see simplified design as the epitome of the modern era and Art Deco skyscrapers as symbolizing progress, innovation, and modernity. The 1916 Zoning Resolution restricted the height that street-side exterior walls of New York City buildings could rise before needing to be setback from the street. This led to the construction of Art Deco structures in New York City with significant setbacks, large volumes, and striking silhouettes that were often elaborately decorated. Art Deco buildings were constructed for only a short period of time; but because that period was during the city's late-1920s\u00a0real\u00a0estate\u00a0boom, the numerous skyscrapers built in the Art Deco style predominated in the city skyline, giving it the romantic quality seen in films and plays. The Chrysler Building project was shaped by these circumstances."

        "content": "Originally, the Chrysler Building was to be the Reynolds Building, a project of real estate developer and former\u00a0New York State\u00a0Senator William\u00a0H. Reynolds. Prior to his involvement in planning the building, Reynolds was best known for developing Coney Island's Dreamland amusement park.\u00a0When the amusement park was destroyed by fire in 1911, Reynolds turned his attention to\u00a0Manhattan real estate, where he set out to build the tallest building in the world. In 1921, Reynolds rented a large plot of land at the corner of Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street with the intention of building a tall building on the site. In 1927, after several years of delays, Reynolds hired the architect\u00a0William Van Alen to design a forty-story building there. Van Alen's original design featured many Modernist stylistic elements, with glazed, curved windows at the corners. Van Alen was respected in his field for his work on the Albemarle Building at Broadway and 24th Street, designing it in collaboration with his partner\u00a0H. Craig Severance.\u00a0Van Alen and Severance complemented each other, with Van Alen being an original, imaginative architect and Severance being a shrewd businessperson who handled the firm's finances.\u00a0However, the relationship between them became tense over disagreements on how best to run the firm.\u00a0The breaking point came after a 1924 article in the\u00a0Architectural Review, praising the Albemarle Building's design; Van Alen was attributed as the designer in the firm, while Severance's\u00a0role was altogether ignored. The architects' partnership dissolved acrimoniously several months later, with lawsuits over the firm's clients and assets lasting over a year. The rivalry ended up being decisive for the design of the future Chrysler Building, since Severance's more traditional architectural style would otherwise have restrained Van Alen's more modern outlook."

        "content": "By February 2, 1928, the proposed building's height had been increased to 54 stories, which would have made it the tallest building in Midtown. The proposal was changed again two weeks later, with official plans for a 63-story building. A little more than a week after that, the plan was changed for the third time, with two additional stories added. By this time, 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue were both hubs for construction activity, due to the removal of the Third Avenue Elevated's 42nd Street spur, which was seen as a blight on the area. The adjacent 56-story Chanin Building was also under construction. Because of the elevated spur's removal, real estate speculators believed that Lexington Avenue would become the \"Broadway of the East Side\", causing a ripple effect that would spur developments farther east. In April 1928, Reynolds signed a 67-year lease for the plot and finalized the details of his ambitious project. Van Alen's original design for the skyscraper called for a base with first-floor showroom windows that would be triple-height, and above would be 12 stories with glass-wrapped corners, to create the impression that the tower was floating in mid-air. Reynolds's main contribution to the building's design was his insistence that it have a metallic crown, despite Van Alen's initial opposition; the metal-and-crystal crown would have looked like \"a jeweled sphere\" at night. Originally, the skyscraper would have risen , with 67 floors. These plans were approved in June 1928. Van Alen's drawings were unveiled in the following August and published in a magazine run by the\u00a0American Institute of Architects (AIA). Eventually, this design would prove too advanced and expensive for Reynolds. He instead devised an alternate design for the Reynolds Building, which was published in August 1928. The new design was much more conservative, with an Italianate dome that a critic compared to Governor Al Smith's bowler hat, and a brick arrangement on the upper floors that simulated windows in the corners, a detail that remains in the current Chrysler Building. This design almost exactly reflected the shape, setbacks, and the layout of the windows of the current building, but with a different dome."

        "content": "With the design complete, groundbreaking for the Reynolds Building took place on September 19, 1928, but Reynolds did not have the means to carry on construction. Reynolds sold the plot, lease, plans, and architect's services to Walter Chrysler for $2 million on October 15, 1928. That same day, the Goodwin Construction Company began demolition of what had been built. A contract was awarded on October 28, and demolition was completed on November 9. Chrysler's initial plans for the building were similar to Reynolds's, but with the 808-foot building having 68 floors instead of 67. The plans entailed a ground-floor pedestrian arcade; a facade of stone below the fifth floor and brick-and-terracotta above; and a three-story bronze-and-glass \"observation dome\" at the top. However, Chrysler wanted a more progressive design, and he worked with Van Alen to redesign the skyscraper to be  tall. At the new height, Chrysler's building would be taller than the  Woolworth Building, a building in lower Manhattan that was the world's tallest at the time. At one point, Chrysler had requested that Van Alen shorten the design by ten floors, but reneged on that decision after realizing that the increased height would also result in increased publicity. From late 1928 to early 1929, modifications to the design of the dome continued. In March 1929, the press published details of an \"artistic dome\" that had the shape of a giant thirty-pointed star, which would be crowned by a sculpture five meters high. The final design of the dome included several arches and triangular windows. Lower down, the design was affected by Walter Chrysler's intention to make the building the Chrysler Corporation's headquarters, and as such, various architectural details were modeled after Chrysler automobile products, such as the hood ornaments of the Plymouth (see ). The building's gargoyles on the 31st floor and the eagles on the 61st floor, were created to represent flight, and to embody the machine age of the time. Even the topmost needle was built using a process similar to one Chrysler used to manufacture his cars, with precise \"hand craftmanship\". In his autobiography, Chrysler says he suggested that his building be taller than the Eiffel Tower. Meanwhile, excavation of the new building's  foundation began in mid-November 1928 and was completed in mid-January 1929, when bedrock was reached. A total of  of rock and  of soil were excavated for the foundation, equal to 63% of the future building's weight. Construction of the building proper began on January 21, 1929. The Carnegie Steel Company provided the steel beams, the first of which was installed on March 27; and by April 9, the first upright beams had been set into place. The steel structure was \"a few floors\" high by June 1929, 35 floors high by early August, and completed by September. Despite a frantic steelwork construction pace of about four floors per week, no workers died during the construction of the skyscraper's steelwork. Chrysler lauded this achievement, saying, \"It is the first time that any structure in the world has reached such a height, yet the entire steel construction was accomplished without loss of life\". In total, 391,881 rivets were used, and approximately 3,826,000 bricks were manually laid to create the non-loadbearing walls of the skyscraper. Walter Chrysler personally financed the construction with his income from his car company. The Chrysler Building's height officially surpassed the Woolworth's on October 16, 1929, thereby becoming the world's tallest structure."

        "content": "The same year that the Chrysler Building's construction started, banker George L. Ohrstrom proposed the construction of a 47-story office building at 40 Wall Street downtown. Shortly thereafter, Ohrstrom modified his project to have 60 floors, but it was still below Woolworth and the 808-foot Chrysler Building project, as announced in 1928. H. Craig Severance, Van Alen's former partner and the architect of 40 Wall Street, increased 40 Wall's height to  with 62 floors in April of that year. It would thus exceed the Woolworth's height by  and the Chrysler's by . 40 Wall Street and the Chrysler Building started competing for the distinction of \"world's tallest building\". The Empire State Building, on 34th Street and Fifth Avenue, entered the competition in 1929. The race was defined by at least five other proposals, although only the Empire State Building would survive the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The \"Race into the Sky\", as popular media called it at the time, was representative of the country's optimism in the 1920s, which helped fuel the building boom in major cities. The 40 Wall Street tower was revised from  to 925 feet in April 1929, which would make it the world's tallest. Severance then publicly claimed the title of the world's tallest building. Construction of 40 Wall Street began in May 1929 at a frantic pace, and it was completed twelve months later. In response, Van Alen obtained permission for a  spire and had it secretly constructed inside the frame of his building. The spire was delivered to the site in four different sections. On October 23, 1929, one week after surpassing the Woolworth Building's height and one day before the catastrophic Wall Street Crash of 1929 started, the spire was assembled. According to one account, \"the bottom section of the spire was hoisted to the top of the building's dome and lowered into the 66th floor of the building.\" Then, within 90 minutes the rest of the spire's pieces were raised and riveted in sequence, helping raise the tower's height to 1,046 feet. Van Alen, who witnessed the process from the street along with its engineers and Walter Chrysler, compared the experience to watching a butterfly leaving its cocoon. In \"The Structure and Metal Work of the Chrysler Building\", an article published in the October 1930 edition of Architectural Forum, Van Alen explained the design and construction of the crown and needle: The steel tip brought the Chrysler Building to a height of , greatly exceeding 40 Wall Street's height. However, contemporary news media did not write of the spire's erection, nor were there any press releases celebrating the spire's erection. Even the New York Herald Tribune, which had virtually continuous coverage of the tower's construction, did not report on the spire's installation until days after the spire had been raised. Chrysler realized that his tower's height would exceed the Empire State Building's as well, having ordered Van Alen to change the Chrysler's original roof from a stubby Romanesque dome to the narrow steel spire. However, the Empire State's developer John J. Raskob reviewed the plans and realized that he could add five more floors and a spire of his own to his 80-story building, and subsequently acquired the nearby plots needed to support that building's height extension. Two days later, the Empire State Building's co-developer, former Governor Al Smith, announced the updated plans for that skyscraper, with an observation deck on the 86th-floor roof at a height of , higher than the Chrysler's 71st-floor observation deck at ."

        "content": "In January 1930, it was announced that the Chrysler Corporation would maintain offices in the Chrysler Building during Automobile Show Week, and the first leases by outside tenants were announced in April 1930, before the building was officially completed. The building was formally opened on May 27, 1930, in a ceremony that coincided with the 42nd Street Property Owners and Merchants Association's meeting that year. In the lobby of the building, a bronze plaque that read \"in recognition of Mr. Chrysler's contribution to civic advancement\" was unveiled. Former Governor Smith, former Assemblyman Martin G. McCue, and 42nd Street Association president George W. Sweeney were among those in attendance. By June, it was reported that 65% of the available space had been leased. By August, the building was declared complete, but the New York City Department of Construction did not mark it as finished until February 1932. The added height of the spire allowed the Chrysler Building to surpass 40 Wall Street as the tallest building in the world and the Eiffel Tower as the tallest structure. The Chrysler Building was thus the first man-made structure to be taller than ; and as one newspaper noted, the tower was also taller than the highest points of five states. The Chrysler Building was appraised at $14 million, but was exempt from city taxes per an 1859 law that gave tax exemptions to sites owned by the Cooper Union. The city had attempted to repeal the tax exemption, but Cooper Union had opposed that measure. Because the Chrysler Building retains the tax exemption, it has paid Cooper Union for the use of their land since opening. Van Alen's satisfaction at these accomplishments was likely muted by Walter Chrysler's later refusal to pay the balance of his architectural fee. Chrysler alleged that Van Alen had received bribes from suppliers, and Van Alen had not signed any contracts with Walter Chrysler when he took over the project. Van Alen sued and the courts ruled in his favor, requiring Chrysler to pay Van Alen $840,000, or 6% of the total budget of the building. However, the lawsuit against Chrysler markedly diminished Van Alen's reputation as an architect, which, along with the effects of the Great Depression and negative criticism, ended up ruining his career. Van Alen ended his career as professor of sculpture at the nearby Beaux-Arts Institute of Design and died in 1954. According to author Neal Bascomb, \"The Chrysler Building was his greatest accomplishment, and the one that guaranteed his obscurity.\" The Chrysler Building's distinction as the world's tallest building was short-lived. John Raskob realized the 1,050-foot Empire State Building would only be  taller than the Chrysler Building, and Raskob was afraid that Walter Chrysler might try to \"pull a trick like hiding a rod in the spire and then sticking it up at the last minute.\" Another revision brought the Empire State Building's roof to , making it the tallest building in the world by far when it opened on May 1, 1931. However, the Chrysler Building is still the world's tallest steel-supported brick building. The Chrysler Building fared better commercially than the Empire State Building did: by 1935, the Chrysler had already rented 70% of its floor area, while the Empire State had only leased 23% of its area and was popularly derided as the \"Empty State Building\". The Chrysler Corporation was not involved in the construction or ownership of the Chrysler Building, although it was built and designed for the corporation. It was a project of Walter P. Chrysler for his children. In his autobiography, Chrysler wrote that he wanted to erect the building \"so that his sons would have something to be responsible for\"."

        "content": "The Chrysler family inherited the property after the death of Walter Chrysler in 1940, with the property being under the ownership of W.P. Chrysler Building Corporation. In 1944, the corporation filed plans to build a 38-story annex to the east of the building, at 666 Third Avenue. In 1949, this was revised to a 32-story annex costing $9 million. The annex building, designed by Reinhard, Hofmeister & Walquist, had a facade similar to that of the original Chrysler Building. The stone for the original building was no longer manufactured, and had to be specially replicated. Construction started on the annex in June 1950, and the first tenants started leasing in June 1951. The building itself was completed by 1952, and a sky bridge connecting the two buildings' seventh floors was built in 1959. The family sold the building in 1953 to William Zeckendorf for its assessed price of $18 million. The 1953 deal included the annex and the nearby Graybar Building, which, along with the Chrysler Building, sold for a combined $52 million. The new owners were Zeckendorf's company Webb and Knapp, who held a 75% interest in the sale, and the Graysler Corporation, who held a 25% stake. At the time, it was reported to be the largest real estate sale in New York City's history. In 1957, the Chrysler Building, its annex, and the Graybar Building were sold for $66 million to Lawrence Wien's realty syndicate, setting a new record for the largest sale in the city. In 1960, the complex was purchased by Sol Goldman and Alex DiLorenzo, who received a mortgage from the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company. In 1961, the building's stainless steel elements, including the needle, crown, gargoyles, and entrance doors, were polished for the first time. A group of ten workers steam-cleaned the facade below the 30th floor, and manually cleaned the portion of the tower above the 30th floor, for a cost of about $200,000. Massachusetts Mutual obtained outright ownership in 1975 after Goldman and DiLorenzo defaulted on the mortgage. The company purchased the building for $35 million. In 1978, they devised plans to renovate the facade, heating, ventilation, air\u2010conditioning, elevators, lobby murals, and Cloud Club headquarters in a $23 million project. This renovation was completed in 1979. They delegated the leasing of the building's space to the Edward S. Gordon Company, which leased  of vacant space within five years. During Massachusetts Mutual's ownership of the Chrysler Building, the tower received two historic designations. The building was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1976, and as a New York City Landmark in 1978, although the city only landmarked the lobby and facade. Massachusetts Mutual had opposed the city landmark designation because it \"would cause 'inevitable delay' in moving new tenants into the skyscraper\". At the time, the building had  of vacant floor space, representing 40% of the total floor area. In September 1979, the building was sold again, this time to entrepreneur and Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke, in a deal that also transferred ownership of the Los Angeles Kings and Lakers to Jerry Buss. The spire underwent a restoration that was completed in 1995. The joints in the now-closed observation deck were polished, and the facade restored, as part of a $1.5 million project. Some damaged steel strips of the needle were replaced and several parts of the gargoyles were re-welded together. The cleaning received the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Lucy G. Moses Preservation Award for 1997. Cooke died in 1997, and creditors moved to foreclose on the estate's unpaid fees soon after. Tishman Speyer Properties and the Travelers Insurance Group bought the Chrysler Center in 1997\u20131998 for about $220\u00a0million (equal to $ million in ) from a consortium of banks and the estate of Jack Kent Cooke. Tishman Speyer Properties had negotiated a 150-year lease from the Cooper Union, and the college continues to own the land under the Chrysler Building. Cooper Union's name is on the deed."

The structure contains 3,862 exterior windows. Approximately fifty metal ornaments protrude at the building's corners on five floors reminiscent of gargoyles on Gothic cathedrals. The 31st-floor contains gargoyles as well as replicas of the 1929 Chrysler radiator caps, and the 61st-floor is adorned with eagles as a nod to America's national bird. The Chrysler Building uses bright \"Nirosta\" stainless steel extensively in its design, an austenitic alloy developed in Germany by Krupp (a German acronym for nichtrostender Stahl, meaning \"non-rusting steel\"). It was the first use of this \"18-8 stainless steel\" in an American project, composed of 18% chromium and 8% nickel. Nirosta was used in the exterior ornaments, the window frames, the crown, and the needle. The steel was an integral part of Van Alen's design, as E.E. Thum explains: \"The use of permanently bright metal was of greatest aid in the carrying of rising lines and the diminishing circular forms in the roof treatment, so as to accentuate the gradual upward swing until it literally dissolves into the sky....\" Stainless steel producers used the Chrysler Building to evaluate the durability of the product in architecture. In 1929, the American Society for Testing Materials created an inspection committee to study its performance, which regarded the Chrysler Building as the best location to do so; a subcommittee examined the building's panels every five years until 1960, when the inspections were canceled because the panels had shown minimal deterioration."

This gives the building the appearance of a ziggurat on one side and a U-shaped palazzo on the other.

The floor plans of the first sixteen floors were made as large as possible to optimize the amount of rental space nearest ground level, which was seen as most desirable. The U-shaped cut above the fourth floor served as a shaft for air flow and illumination. The area between floors 28 and 31 added \"visual interest to the middle of the building, preventing it from being dominated by the heavy detail of the lower floors and the eye-catching design of the finial.

At each corner of the 31st floor, large car-hood ornaments made of Nirosta steel serve as visually striking objects that make the base look larger. These corner extensions help counter a common optical illusion seen in tall buildings with horizontal bands, whose taller floors would normally look larger. The 31st floor also contains a gray and white frieze of hubcaps and fenders, which symbolizes both the Chrysler Corporation and serves as a visual signature of the building's Art Deco design. The bonnet embellishments take the shape of Mercury's winged helmet and resemble hood ornaments installed on Chrysler vehicles at the time. The shaft of the tower was designed to emphasize both the horizontal and vertical: each of the tower's four sides contains three columns of windows, each framed by bricks and an unbroken marble pillar that rises along the entirety of each side. The spandrels separating the windows contain \"alternating vertical stripes in gray and white brick\", while each corner contains horizontal rows of black brick."

        "content": "The Chrysler Building is renowned for, and recognized by, its terraced crown, which is an extension of the main tower. Composed of seven radiating terraced arches, Van Alen's design of the crown is a cruciform groin vault of seven concentric members with transitioning setbacks, mounted one behind another. The entire crown is clad with Nirosta steel, ribbed and riveted in a radiating sunburst pattern with many triangular vaulted windows, reminiscent of the spokes of a wheel. The windows are repeated, in smaller form, on the terraced crown's seven narrow setbacks. Due to the curved shape of the dome, the Nirosta sheets had to be measured on site, so most of the work was carried out in workshops on the building's 67th and 75th floors. According to Robinson, the terraced crown \"continue[s] the wedding-cake layering of the building itself. This concept is carried forward from the 61st floor, whose eagle gargoyles echo the treatment of the 31st, to the spire, which extends the concept of 'higher and narrower' forward to infinite height and infinitesimal width. This unique treatment emphasizes the building's height, giving it an other worldly atmosphere reminiscent of the fantastic architecture of Coney Island or the Far East.\" Television station WCBS-TV (Channel 2) originated its transmission from the top of the Chrysler Building in 1938. WCBS-TV transmissions were shifted to the Empire State Building in 1960 in response to competition from RCA's transmitter on that building. For many years WPAT-FM and WTFM (now WKTU) also transmitted from the Chrysler Building, but their move to the Empire State Building by the 1970s ended commercial broadcasting from the structure. The crown and spire are illuminated by a combination of fluorescent lights framing the crown's distinctive triangular windows and colored floodlights that face toward the building, allowing it to be lit in a variety of schemes for special occasions. The V-shaped fluorescent \"tube lighting\" \u2013 hundreds of 480V 40W bulbs framing 120 window openings \u2013 was added in 1981, although it had been part of the original design. Until 1998, the lights were turned off at 2\u00a0a.m., but The New York Observer columnist Ron Rosenbaum convinced Tishman Speyer to keep the lights on until 6\u00a0a.m. Since 2015, the Chrysler Building and other city skyscrapers have been part of the Audubon Society's Lights Out program, turning off their lights during bird migration seasons."

        "title": "Chrysler Building_Lobby",
        "content": "The triangular lobby is regarded as a paragon of the Art Deco style, with clear influences of German Expressionism. Chrysler wanted the design to impress other architects and automobile magnates, so he imported various materials without giving consideration to the extra costs incurred. He covered the walls with huge slabs of African red granite. On the floor, he marked a path from the entrances to the elevators using travertine from Siena. Originally, Van Alen's plans for the lobby included four large supporting columns, but they were removed after Chrysler objected on the grounds that the columns made the lobby appear \"cramped\". Opposite the main entrance is a security guard's desk topped by a digital clock. The lobby has dim lighting that gives it a somewhat subdued quality, although the appliqu\u00e9s of the lamps are striking and iconic. Both combine to create an intimate atmosphere and act to highlight the place. Vertical bars of fluorescent light are covered with Belgian blue marble and Mexican amber onyx, which soften and diffuse the light, to both illuminate and blend with the red marble walls. The lobby also contains four elevator banks, each with a different design. The ceiling contains a  mural named \"Transport and Human Endeavor\", commissioned from Edward Trumbull in 1930. The mural's theme is \"energy and man's application of it to the solution of his problems\", and it pays homage to the Golden Age of Aviation and the Machine Age. The mural is painted in the shape of a \"Y\" with ocher and golden tones. The central image of the mural is a \"muscled giant whose brain directs his boundless energy to the attainment of the triumphs of this mechanical era\", according to a 1930 pamphlet that advertised the building. The mural's Art Deco style is manifested in characteristic triangles, sharp angles, slightly curved lines, chrome ornaments, and numerous patterns. The mural depicts several silver planes, including the Spirit of St. Louis, as well as furnaces of incandescent steel and the building itself. There is a wall panel dedicated to the work of clinchers, surveyors, masons, carpenters, plasterers, and builders. Fifty different figures were modeled after workers who participated in its construction. In 1999, the mural was returned to its original state after a restoration that removed the polyurethane coating and filled-in holes added in the 1970s. Presently, the lobby is the only publicly accessible part of the Chrysler Building. When the building opened, the first and second floors housed a public exhibition of Chrysler vehicles. The exhibition, known as the Chrysler Automobile Salon, was near the corner of Lexington Avenue and 42nd Streets, and opened in 1936. The ground floor featured \"invisible glass\" display windows, a  diameter turntable upon which automobiles were displayed, and a ceiling with lights arranged in concentric circles. Escalators led to the showroom's second floor where Plymouths, Dodges, and DeSotos were sold. The Chrysler Salon remained operational through at least the 1960s."

        "title": "Chrysler Building_Elevators",
        "content": "There are 32 elevators in the skyscraper, clustered into four banks. At the time of opening, 28 of these elevators were for passenger use. Each bank serves different floors within the building, with several \"express\" elevators going from the lobby to a few landings in between, while \"local\" elevators connect the landings with the floors above these intermediate landings. As per Walter Chrysler's wishes, the elevators were designed to run at a rate of , despite the  speed restriction enforced in all city elevators at the time. This restriction was loosened soon after the Empire State Building opened in 1931, as that building had also been equipped with high-speed elevators. The Chrysler Building also had three of the longest elevator shafts in the world at the time of completion. Over the course of a year, Van Alen painstakingly designed these elevators with the assistance of L.T.M. Ralston, who was in charge of developing the elevator cabs' mechanical parts. The cabs were manufactured by the Otis Elevator Company, while the doors were made by the Tyler Company. The dimensions of each elevator were  deep by  wide. The doors are made of metal and covered with eight types of exotic woods. When the doors are closed, they resemble \"tall fans set off by metallic palm fronds rising through a series of silver parabolas, whose edges were set off by curved lilies\" from the outside, as noted by Curcio. However, when a set of doors is open, the cab behind the doors resembles \"an exquisite Art Deco room\". These elements were influenced by ancient Egyptian designs, which significantly impacted the Art Deco style. According to Vincent Curcio, \"these elevator interiors were perhaps the single most beautiful and, next to the dome, the most important feature of the entire building.\" Even though the woods in the elevator cabs were arranged in four basic patterns, each cab had a unique combination of woods. Curcio stated that \"if anything the building is based on patterned fabrics, [the elevators] certainly are. Three of the designs could be characterized as having 'geometric', 'Mexican' and vaguely 'art nouveau' motifs, which reflect the various influences on the design of the entire building.\" The roof of each elevator was covered with a metal plate whose design was unique to that cab, which in turn was placed on a polished wooden pattern that was also customized to the cab. Hidden behind these plates were ceiling fans. Curcio wrote that these elevators \"are among the most beautiful small enclosed spaces in New York, and it is fair to say that no one who has seen or been in them has forgotten them\". Curcio compared the elevators to the curtains of a Ziegfeld production, noting that each lobby contains lighting that peaks in the middle and slopes down on either side. The decoration of the cabs' interiors was also a nod to the Chrysler Corporation's vehicles: cars built during the building's early years had dashboards with wooden moldings. Both the doors and cab interiors were considered to be works of extraordinary marquetry."

The Interborough Rapid Transit Company, which at the time was the operator of all the routes serving the 42nd Street station, originally sued to block construction of the new entrance because it would cause crowding, but the New York City Board of Transportation pushed to allow the corridor anyway. Chrysler eventually built and paid for the building's subway entrance. Work on the new entrance started in March 1930 and it opened along with the Chrysler Building two months later. The basement also had a \"hydrozone water bottling unit\" that would filter tap water into drinkable water for the building's tenants.

Its creation was spurred by Texaco's wish for a proper restaurant for its executives prior to renting fourteen floors in the building. The Cloud Club was a compromise between William Van Alen's modern style and Walter Chrysler's stately and traditional tastes. A member had to be elected, and if accepted, paid an initial fee of $200, plus a $150 to $300 annual fee. There was a Tudor-style foyer on the 66th floor with oak paneling, and an old English-style grill room with wooden floors, wooden beams, wrought-iron chandeliers, and glass and lead doors. The main dining room, on the 67th floor, was connected to the 66th floor by a Renaissance-style marble and bronze staircase and had a futuristic appearance, with polished granite columns and etched glass appliqu\u00e9s in Art Deco style. There was a mural of a cloud on the ceiling, and a mural of Manhattan on the dining room's north side. It is believed that the dining room was an inspiration for the Rainbow Room and the Rockefeller Center Luncheon Club, both at 30 Rockefeller Center. On the same floor, Walter Chrysler and Texaco both had private dining rooms. Chrysler's dining room had a black and frosted-blue glass frieze of automobile workers. The 68th floor mainly contained service spaces. In the 1950s and 1960s, members left the Cloud Club for other clubs. Texaco, whose executives comprised most of the Cloud Club's membership, moved to Westchester County in 1977, and the club closed two years later. Although there have been several projects to rehabilitate the club or transform it into a disco or a gastronomic club, these plans have never materialized, as then-owner Cooke reportedly did not want a \"conventional\" restaurant operating within the old club. Tishman Speyer rented the top two floors of the old Cloud Club. The old staircase has been removed, as have many of the original decorations, which prompted objections from the Art Deco Society of New York."

Van Alen was hailed as the \"Doctor of Altitude\" by Architect magazine, while architect Kenneth Murchison called Van Alen the \"Ziegfeld of his profession\", comparing him to popular Broadway producer Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. The building was praised for being \"an expression of the intense activity and vibrant life of our day\", and for \"teem[ing] with the spirit of modernism, ... the epitome of modern business life, stand[ing] for progress in architecture and in modern building methods.\" An anonymous critic wrote in Architectural Forum October 1930 issue: \"The Chrysler...stands by itself, something apart and alone. It is simply the realization, the fulfillment in metal and masonry, of a one-man dream, a dream of such ambitions and such magnitude as to defy the comprehension and the criticism of ordinary men or by ordinary standards.\" Conversely, journalist George S. Chappell called the Chrysler's design \"distinctly a stunt design, evolved to make the man in the street look up\". Douglas Haskell stated that the building \"embodies no compelling, organic idea\", and alleged that Van Alen had abandoned \"some of his best innovations in behalf of stunts and new 'effects'\". Others compared the Chrysler Building to \"an upended swordfish\", or claimed it had a \"Little Nemo\"-like design. Lewis Mumford, a supporter of the International Style and one of the foremost architectural critics of the United States at the time, despised the building for its \"inane romanticism, meaningless voluptuousness, [and] void symbolism\". The public also had mixed reviews of the Chrysler Building, as Murchison wrote: \"Some think it's a freak; some think it's a stunt.\" Later reviews were more positive. Architect Robert A. M. Stern wrote that the Chrysler Building was \"the most extreme example of the [1920s and 1930s] period's stylistic experimentation\", as contrasted with 40 Wall Street and its \"thin\" detailing. George H. Douglas wrote in 2004 that the Chrysler Building \"remains one of the most appealing and awe-inspiring of skyscrapers\". Architect Le Corbusier called the building \"hot jazz in stone and steel\". Architectural critic Ada Louise Huxtable stated that the building had \"a wonderful, decorative, evocative aesthetic\", while Paul Goldberger noted the \"compressed, intense energy\" of the lobby, the \"magnificent\" elevators, and the \"magical\" view from the crown. The city's Landmarks Preservation Commission said that the tower \"embodies the romantic essence of the New York City skyscraper\". The travel guide Frommer's gave the building an \"exceptional\" recommendation, with author Pauline Frommer writing, \"In the Chrysler Building we see the roaring-twenties version of what Alan Greenspan called 'irrational exuberance'\u2014a last burst of corporate headquarter building before stocks succumbed to the thudding crash of 1929.\""

The building was supposed to be featured in the 1933 film King Kong, but only makes a cameo at the end thanks to its producers opting for the Empire State Building in a central role. The Chrysler Building notably appears in the background of The Wiz (1978); as the setting of much of Q - The Winged Serpent (1982); in the initial credits of The Shadow of the Witness (1987); and during or after apocalyptic events in Independence Day (1996), Armageddon (1998), Deep Impact (1998), Godzilla (1998), and A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001). The building also appears in other films, such as Spider-Man (2002), Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007), Two Weeks Notice (2002), The Sorcerer's Apprentice (2010) and Men in Black 3 (2012).

The Chrysler Building is frequently the subject of photographers.  In December 1929, Walter Chrysler hired the famed Margaret Bourke-White to capture it for publicity purposes. She took the images from a scaffold  high and worked in a 61st-floor studio designed by John Vassos, until she was evicted in 1934. According to one account, Bourke-White wanted to live in the building for the duration of the photo shoot, but the only person able to do so was the janitor, so she was instead relegated to co-leasing a studio with Time Inc. In 1930, several of her photographs were used in a special report on skyscrapers in the then-new Fortune magazine. In 1934, Bourke-White's partner Oscar Graubner took a famous photo called \"Margaret Bourke-White atop the Chrysler Building\", which depicts her taking a photo of the city's skyline while sitting on one of the 61st-floor eagle ornaments. On October 5, 1998, Christie's auctioned the photograph for $96,000. In addition, during a January 1931 dance organized by the Society of Beaux-Arts, six architects, including Van Alen, were photographed while wearing costumes resembling the buildings that each architect designed. The building is also mentioned in the lyrics of several songs, as well as in the number \"It's the Hard Knock Life\" for the musical Annie. In the Squaresoft (now Square Enix) videogame Parasite Eve, the building is the setting for the post-game content."

        "content": "Belton House is a Grade I listed country house in the parish of Belton near Grantham in Lincolnshire, England, built between 1685 and 1688 by Sir John Brownlow, 3rd Baronet. It is surrounded by formal gardens and a series of avenues leading to follies within a larger wooded park. Belton has been described as a compilation of all that is finest of Carolean architecture, the only truly vernacular style of architecture that England had produced since the Tudor period. It is considered to be a complete example of a typical English country house. For about three centuries until 1984, Belton House was the seat successively of the Brownlow family, which had first acquired land in the area in the late 16th century, and of its heirs the Cust family (in 1815 created Earl Brownlow). Despite his great wealth Sir John Brownlow, 3rd Baronet, chose to build a comparatively modest house rather than one of the grand Baroque palaces being built by others at the time. The contemporary, if provincial, Carolean style was the selected choice of design. The new house was fitted with the latest innovations such as sash windows for the principal rooms, and more significantly, with completely separate areas for the staff. Successive generations made changes to the interior of the house which reflected their changing social position and tastes, yet the fabric and design of the house changed little. Following World War I the Custs, like many wealthy English families, were faced with mounting financial problems and finally in 1984 they donated the house, with most of its contents, to the National Trust, which now opens Belton to the public. It is in a good state of repair and is visited by many thousands of tourists each year."

        "content": "The Brownlow family, a dynasty of lawyers, began accumulating land in the Belton area from approximately 1598. In 1609 they acquired the reversion of the manor of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. King James had stayed a night as a guest of Sir Henry Pakenham in the old house in March 1617 on his way to Scotland. The old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of \u00a39,000 per annum (about \u00a3 in present-day terms) and \u00a320,000 in cash (equivalent to about \u00a3 now). They immediately bought a town house in the newly fashionable Southampton Square in Bloomsbury, and decided to build a new country house at Belton. Work on the new house began in 1685. The architect thought to have been responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, that it could have been the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons. Whoever the architect, Belton follows closely the design of Clarendon House, completed in 1667. This great London town house (demolished c. 1683) has been one of the most admired buildings of its era due to \"its elegant symmetry and confident and common-sensical design\". Sir John Summerson described Clarendon House as \"the most influential house of its time among those who aimed at the grand manner\" and Belton as \"much the finest surviving example of its class\". John and Alice Brownlow assembled one of the finest teams of craftsmen available at the time to work on the project. This dream team was headed by the master mason William Stanton who oversaw the project. His second in command, John Thompson, had worked with Sir Christopher Wren on several of the latter's London churches, while the chief joiner John Sturges had worked at Chatsworth under William Talman. The wrought-ironworker John Warren worked under Stanton at Denham Place, Buckinghamshire, and the fine wrought iron gates and overthrow at Belton may be his. Thus so competent were the builders of Belton that Winde may have done little more than provide the original plans and drawings, leaving the interpretation to the on-site craftsmen. This theory is further demonstrated by the external appearance of the adjoining stable block. More provincial, and less masterful in proportion, it is known to have been entirely the work of Stanton."

        "content": "The late 17th century in England was a time of great progress in design. Following the austere years of Commonwealth rule, a great flourishing and development in both architecture and the arts began after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. Royalist exiles and wealthy young men who made the Grand Tour, returned home with new ideas\u2014often extravagant variations on classical themes. This was, for England, the dawn of the Baroque era. The new wave of architects such as Roger Pratt, John Webb, and Sir Christopher Wren were not just building vast edifices in Renaissance-inspired styles, but also transforming existing older houses. Representative of the utilisation of older houses is Coleshill House in Berkshire, where Pratt transformed the medieval, but now redundant, great hall into a classically inspired entrance hall complete with an imperial staircase. Great Halls were considered redundant now that employers wished to live separately from their servants, and no longer ate with them in a Great Hall. All evidence and odours of cooking and staff were banished from the principal parts of the house. Employers began to live in fine airy rooms, above the ground floor, with privacy from their servants, who were now confined, unless required, to specifically delegated areas\u2014often the ground and uppermost attic floors. This was a period of great social change in British history, and the educated prided themselves on enlightenment and elegance. Belton was designed in the restrained almost Palladian-inspired architecture of the time immediately before the full emergence in England of the ornate Baroque. The general form this architecture took was of severely symmetrical, often rectangular houses, with a pediment over the central bays. This almost rigid concept was to influence the design of innumerable houses, including Belton. Later to be known as the Carolean style (from \"Carolus,\" the Latin name for the reigning monarch Charles II), it was popular with the minor aristocracy and gentry for both their town and country houses until long after Charles II's death. Belton is faced with the local Ancaster stone, with a lighter ashlar from Ketton for the quoining. The \"H\"-shaped plan was a design which became popular in the late Elizabethan period. However, by the late 16th century, domestic architecture had evolved further than the \"one room deep\" ranges of the earlier \"H\" plan houses, such as Montacute House. The new layout placed rooms back to back, creating a house two rooms deep. This became known as \"double pile\". As at Belton, this permitted rooms to be not just better lit and heated but also better accessed and related to each other, and with the greatest advantage of all\u2014greater privacy. On the construction side, the double room depth allowed the house to be more compact and under one, more easily constructed, roof, thus lowering building costs."

        "content": "The plan of the rooms at Belton was pass\u00e9 for a grand house of its time. Following the Restoration and the influx of European ideas, it had become popular for large houses to follow the continental fashion of a suite of state rooms consisting of a withdrawing room, dressing room, and bedroom proceeding from either side of a central saloon or hall. These rooms were permanently reserved for use by a high ranking guest, such as a visiting monarch. While Belton does have a saloon at its centre, enfilades of state rooms of lessening grandeur do not flank it. The possible reason for this unusual layout is that, while the Brownlows possessed great wealth, their title was only a baronetcy, and their fortune was barely a century old. They would have been regarded as gentry, not aristocracy. As a result, building a suite of state rooms would have been in hope rather than anticipation of a royal guest. However, the lack of a fashionable and formal suite of state apartments coupled with the Brownlows' lack of social credentials did not prevent a visit from King William III to the newly completed house in 1695. The King occupied the \"Best bedchamber\", a large room with an adjoining closet, directly above the saloon, that led directly from the second floor Great Dining Chamber. This design followed the older style of having reception rooms and bedrooms scattered over the two main floors. The layout used followed Roger Pratt's theory that guest and family rooms should be quite separate. As a consequence of this philosophy, the family occupied the rooms on the first and second floors of the west and east wings, with the state rooms in the centre. The great staircase, designed to be grand and imposing, rose to the east side of the house, and formed part of the guest's state route from the Hall and Saloon on the first floor to the principal dining room and bedroom on the second. The principal entrance hall, reception and family bedrooms were placed on the ground and first floors above a low semi-basement containing service rooms. The two principal entrances to the mansion in the centre of both the north and south facades were accessed by external staircases, originally a single flared flight on the north side and a double staircase on the south, each of which have since been replaced by single broad flights of steps. The second floor has a matching fenestration, with windows of equal value to those on the first floor below. The very latest innovation, sash windows, was used on both floors. The semi-basement and attic storey used the more old-fashioned mullioned and transomed windows, indicating the lower status of the occupants of these floors. It was clearly emphasised from without that the two main floors of the house were purely for state and family use, and the staff and service areas were confined to the semi-basement and attic floors. This concept of keeping staff and domestic matters out of sight (when not required) was relatively new and had first been employed by Pratt in the design of Coleshill House in Berkshire. The contemporary social commentator of the day Roger North lauded back stairs, of which Belton has two examples (5 and 14 on plan), as one of the most important inventions of his day. The principal room is the large Marble Hall (1) at the centre of the south front; this hall is the beginning of a grand procession of rooms, and corresponds to the former Great Parlour or Saloon (9) on the north front. The Marble Hall is flanked by the former Little Parlour (11, now the Tapestry Room) and the Great Staircase (2), while the Saloon is flanked by two withdrawing rooms (8, 10). The bedrooms are arranged in individual suites on both floors of the two wings (3, etc.) that flank the state centre of the house. The main staircase, set to one side of the Marble Hall, is one of the few things at Belton which is asymmetrically placed. It has a robust plaster-work ceiling incorporating the Brownlow crest by the London plasterer Edward Goudge, \"now looked on as ye best master in England in his profession,\" William Winde reported in 1690. Bodily and spiritual needs were balanced symmetrically within the mansion: the kitchen (16) and the chapel (7) were both large two-storied halls, rising from the semi-basement to the first floor. This design not only provided a great and lofty space, but also allowed the servants to worship in the chapel without leaving the service floor, while their employers would worship from a private gallery, complete with fireplace, overlooking the chapel on the first floor. One of the most Carolean features of the house is the balustrade and cupola surmounting the roof, another element introduced to English architecture by Roger Pratt. The cupola at Belton does not light a lofty domed hall, as is often the case in Europe, but houses a staircase which gives access to a large viewing platform on top of a lead roof, concealed from the ground by the balustrade which tops the more conventional and visible hipped roof. From this vantage point, the owners of Belton could admire the perfect symmetry of their avenues and formal gardens spreading from the house. This feature of the house was removed by the architect James Wyatt when he modernised the house in the 18th century. It was restored to its original form in the 1870s by the 3rd Earl Brownlow."

        "content": "Some of Belton's many rooms have been altered over the last 300 years both in use and design. One of the principal rooms, the Marble Hall (1), the first of the large reception rooms, serves as an entrance hall from the south entrance, and takes its name from a chequer board patterned floor of black and white marble tiles. By the time of Belton's conception, the great hall was no longer a place for the household to eat, but intended as a grand entrance to the house. The hall was originally hung with 28 portraits of Kings, Queens, and Emperors, from William the Conqueror to William III, intended to give the house an air of dynastic importance. The less numerous and far newer Brownlow family portraits were originally hung in the Great Dining Room immediately above. The room is fully panelled, and parts of the panelling contain lime wood embellishments attributed to Grinling Gibbons. In the early 19th century, this room, and some others, were re-modelled by Jeffry Wyatville, who in addition to graining and painting the panelling to imitate oak installed new doors. The second of the principal reception rooms, the Saloon (9), opens from the Marble Hall. This large panelled room is on an axis to the avenues of the formal north gardens. Originally known as the Great Parlour, this has always been the chief reception room of the house. It retains its original marble fireplace and has an ornate plaster ceiling which is a Victorian copy of the original ceiling by the Carolean plasterer Edward Goudge. The centrepiece of the room is a large Aubusson carpet made in 1839 for the 1st Earl Brownlow. Either side of the Saloon are two smaller drawing rooms (8, 10), which would originally have served as private withdrawing rooms from the more public activities which would have taken place in the Marble Hall and Saloon. One of these rooms, now called the Tyrconnel Room (10), was transformed into the principal or state bedroom during the occupancy of Lord Tyrconnel in an attempt to create a more fashionable suite of Baroque state rooms on the first floor. After his death in 1754, it became a Billiard Room, until the 3rd Earl Brownlow had it refurnished more than a century later. Unusually, the floor is painted with the family arms and crest. The date of the floor is not known for certain but the early nineteenth century has been suggested. The final large reception room on the first floor is the Hondecoeter Room (16), so named because of the three huge oil paintings by Melchior d'Hondecoeter (1636\u20131695), depicting scenes of birds in courtyards, which are fitted into the neo-Carolean panelling. The panelling was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876, when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion. The room was initially created as a library in 1808 from the upper part of the earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories. The West staircase (14) was originally a service stairs, and would have been plainer in decor, but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family. Either side of the Marble Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which contains a collection of early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The Great Staircase to the east of the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would expect to find the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by James Wyatt in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today. Rupert Gunnis attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir Richard Westmacott. Leading from the Library is the Queen's Room, the former \"Best Bed Chamber\". This panelled room was redecorated in 1841 for the visit of Queen Adelaide, widow of William IV, when its former function as a state bedroom was resurrected. It contains the great canopied Rococo-style bed in which the Queen slept, complete with the royal monogram \"AR\" (Adelaide Regina) embroidered on the bedhead. Other rooms on the second floor are mostly bedrooms, which include the Chinese Room (directly above the Tyrconnel Room) with its original hand-painted 18th-century Chinese wallpaper, the Yellow Room (directly above the Blue Room), and the Windsor Bedroom (directly above the School Room), so-called following its use by King Edward VIII of the United Kingdom, who became the Duke of Windsor after the abdication crisis of 1936. Edward visited Belton in the 1930s with his mistress Wallis Simpson, and the 6th Baron Brownlow was heavily involved in the crisis thanks to his position as the King's Lord-in-waiting. Today, Belton has a permanent exhibition devoted to that event. Another royal visitor, Charles, Prince of Wales, also used the room frequently while a cadet at nearby RAF Cranwell."

        "content": "In 1690, Sir John Brownlow was granted permission to enclose an area of 1,000\u00a0acres (4\u00a0km2) to transform into a park, with a grant to keep deer. There is evidence to suggest that some of this area had been a park since at least 1580. The park was laid out with avenues, including the still surviving Eastern Avenue which led east from the house. Brownlow also had a large pond or lake dug and planted 21,400 ash trees, 9,500 oak trees, and 614 fruit trees. It is thought that William Winde may have advised on the layout of the gardens. Closer to the house were a series of more formal gardens, including canal ponds bordered by plantations containing symmetrical walks resembling the \"rond-points\" (circular clearings in a garden from which straight paths radiate) introduced by the landscape gardener Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre. By the end of the eighteenth century, these formal parterres had been removed and the canal ponds filled in. Sir John Brownlow was succeeded at Belton by his brother, who was content to permit Brownlow's widow, Alice, to remain in occupation. She spent the remainder of her life at Belton arranging advantageous marriages for her five daughters. On her death in 1721, the house passed to her husband's nephew (and her son-in-law) Sir John Brownlow III (later Viscount Tyrconnel). Tyrconnel, a dilettante of no great intellect, was responsible for many of the architectural features which survive in the park and garden. Between 1742 and 1751, a series of follies, including a Gothic ruin, a cascade, and a prospect or belvedere known as the Belmount Tower, were constructed for him. When built the tower had two small wings flanking each side, since removed. John Cust, 1st Earl Brownlow, owner of Belton House from 1807 to 1853, commissioned the architect Anthony Salvin to undertake improvements to the Estate in 1838. Salvin's additions included a public house, estate cottages, a hermitage and the boathouse."

        "content": "In 1754, Belton was inherited by Sir John Cust, the son of previous owner Viscount Tyrconnel's widowed sister. Cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent 1760s, and his monument at Belton blames his death at the age of 51 to the \"unusual fatigues of his office\". His heir was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years. In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted. At the beginning of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home dep\u00f4t and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established in the southern part of Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and Grantham railway station on the East Coast Main Line. The dep\u00f4t was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920. Little sign of the Machine Gun Corps's stay remains in the park, but plaques and inscriptions can be followed from the south gate of Belton park to the memorial gate on the way from there to the town centre and in the north aisle of Grantham parish church.  This was the subject for an episode of Time Team; season 20, episode 01, \"The Forgotten Gunners of WWI\". Belton again saw war service during World War II. From 1942, part of the Royal Air Force Regiment was housed in Nissen huts at the park in a facility named RAF Belton Park. The years following World War I were severely testing for the owners of many great estates. The staff both indoor and outdoor, which had previously been plentiful, essential, and cheap, were now in short supply. Millions of men had left private service to join the army, and very few returned. Female domestic staff had been called up for war service in factories, and now realised there was an easier and better paid existence outside of the gates of the great country houses. Belton House remained relatively untouched during this period, largely owing to the failing fortunes of the Brownlow family. The 3rd Earl Brownlow and his Countess lived for only a few months of the year at Belton, where they came for the fox-hunting, and divided the remainder of their time between their house in London and Ashridge, another country house in Hertfordshire. Ashridge, a huge Gothic revival pile, had come to the Brownlows in the 19th century through the Egerton family. It was sold, with its art collection and furnishings, to pay the death duties arising on the death of the 3rd Earl in 1921. Hence Belton became the Brownlows' sole country home. Further death duties were incurred in 1927 on the death of the 3rd Earl's successor, his second cousin Adelbert Cust, 5th Baron Brownlow. In the ensuing period many thousands of country houses of great architectural value were demolished, or had whole wings razed to the ground. In 1955 alone one house was demolished every five days. In this respect Belton was fortunate to survive at all, as in addition to the family's problems, the house deteriorated to such an extent that in 1961 the 6th Baron employed the architect Francis Johnson to oversee a large restoration program lasting three years. Not only was the roof repaired but much of the panelling taken down and repaired, and new cornices installed. Also attempts were made to curtail serious infestations of dry rot."

        "content": "The seventh Baron attempted to retain the house and estate by opening to the public. An adventure playground was built in the nearby woods to attract families to the house as a tourist attraction. However, the financial difficulties were too great and in January 1984 he transferred ownership of the house, garden, and some of the contents to the National Trust, a charitable body experienced in the management of historic properties. An auction of the contents was held at Belton House by Christie's over three days 30 April \u2013 2 May 1984, comprising 1,022 lots. The National Trust then purchased at a cost of \u00a38 million (worth about \u00a3 today) 1,317\u00a0acres (5.3\u00a0km2) of parkland and much of the remaining contents with a grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund. The Trust quickly produced a guide book for the 1984 season and opened to the public. A priority was the establishment of a restaurant, which would not only augment the estate's income, but also encourage people to spend more time at Belton, and travel greater distances to visit. Though the house, its contents, and outbuildings were in an adequate state of repair at the time of the gift, they have since become part of an ongoing programme of conservation and restoration. At the same time, the National Trust has introduced new features and attractions such as a silver exhibition that displays a collection of silver amassed by the Brownlow family, dating from 1698. Further revenue is raised from the use of the property as a filming location, and from licensing the Marble Hall for civil weddings. The house features in the BBC's 1988 adaptation of Moondial. and also as \"Rosings Park\" in the BBC's 1995 television version of Pride and Prejudice. It was visited by 460,547 people during 2019."

The historic site contains 23 standing columns and 5 partial columns; it is administered by the Mississippi Department of Archives and History. Through the years, three of the cast iron stairways, that survived the 1890 fire, disappeared from the site.  The fourth stairway was moved to Alcorn State University and serves as the entrance to Oakland Memorial Chapel. North of Windsor Ruins is a cemetery where members of the Daniell and Freeland families have been buried since the early 19th century.

        "content": "The Jefferson Memorial is a presidential memorial built in Washington, D.C. between 1939 and 1943 under the sponsorship of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt thought that it was a suitable memorial to the Founding Fathers of the United States and to Thomas Jefferson, the principal author of the United States Declaration of Independence and the founder of the Democratic-Republican Party. The neoclassical building is situated in West Potomac Park on the shore of the Potomac River. It was designed by John Russell Pope and built by Philadelphia contractor John McShain. Construction began in 1939 and was completed in 1943. The bronze statue of Jefferson was added in 1947. Pope made references to the Roman Pantheon whose designer was Apollodorus of Damascus, and to Jefferson's own design for the rotunda at the University of Virginia. The Jefferson Memorial and the White House form one of the main anchor points in the area of the National Mall in D.C. The Washington Monument was intended to be located at the intersection of the White House and the site for the Jefferson Memorial, but soft swampy ground required that it be situated to the east. The national memorial is managed by the National Park Service of the Department of the Interior  under its National Mall and Memorial Parks division. In 2007, it was ranked fourth on the \"List of America's Favorite Architecture\" by the American Institute of Architects."

        "content": "It became apparent that the site was well suited for another high-profile memorial since it sat directly south of the White House.  By 1901 the Senate Park Commission, better known as the McMillan Commission, had proposed placing a Pantheon-like structure on the site hosting \"the statues of the illustrious men of the nation, or whether the memory of some individual shall be honored by a monument of the first rank may be left to the future\"; no action was ever taken by Congress on this issue. The completion of the Tidal Basin Inlet Bridge in 1908 helped to facilitate the recreational usage of East and West Potomac Parks. In 1918, large liquid-chlorine dispensers were installed under the bridge to treat the water and make the Tidal Basin (also known as Twining Lake) suitable for swimming. The Tidal Basin Beach, on the site of the future Memorial, opened in May 1918 and operated as a \"Whites Only\" facility until 1925, when it was permanently closed to avoid the question of racial integration. A design competition was held for a memorial to Theodore Roosevelt in 1925.  The winning design was submitted by John Russell Pope and consisted of a half-circle memorial situated next to a circular basin.  The plan was never funded by Congress and was not built. The Memorial's chance came in 1934 when President Franklin Roosevelt, an admirer of Jefferson, in large part because of the book on Jefferson by his friend Claude G. Bowers, inquired to the Commission of Fine Arts about the possibility of erecting a memorial to Jefferson, including it in the plans for the Federal Triangle project, which was under construction at the time. Later the same year, Congressman John J. Boylan followed FDR's lead and urged Congress to create the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Commission. Boylan was appointed the Commission's first chairman and Congress eventually appropriated $3\u00a0million for a memorial to Jefferson. The Commission chose John Russell Pope as the architect in 1935. Pope was also the architect of the National Archives Building and original (west) building of the National Gallery of Art. He prepared four different plans for the project, each on a different site. One was on the Anacostia River at the end of East Capitol Street; one at Lincoln Park; one on the south side of the National Mall across from the National Archives; and one situated on the Tidal Basin, directly south of the White House. The Commission preferred the site on the Tidal Basin mainly because it was the most prominent site and because it completed the four-point plan called for by the McMillan Commission (Lincoln Memorial to the Capitol; White House to the Tidal Basin site).  Pope designed a very large pantheon-like structure, to sit on a square platform, and to be flanked by two smaller, rectangular, colonnaded buildings."

        "content": "Construction began on December 15, 1938, and the cornerstone was laid on November 15, 1939, by Franklin Roosevelt. By this point Pope had died (1937) and his surviving partners, Daniel P. Higgins and Otto R. Eggers, took over construction of the memorial. The design was modified at the request of the Commission of Fine Arts to a more conservative design. The memorial cost approximately $3\u00a0million to construct. Construction commenced amid significant opposition. The Commission of Fine Arts never actually approved any design for the memorial and even published a pamphlet in 1939 opposing both the design and site of the memorial. Additionally, many Washingtonians opposed the site because it did not align with L'Enfant's original plan for the city; and many well-established elm and cherry trees, including rare stock donated by Japan in 1912, were targeted for removal under the memorial's original plan. Construction continued amid the opposition, which included women protestors chaining themselves to cherry trees. The negative press toward the memorial caused President Roosevelt considerable dismay, but it ultimately helped limit the projected footprint of the new memorial, so that it would peacefully co-exist with the spring-blooming cherry orchard flanking and abutting it. In 1939, the Memorial Commission hosted a competition to select a sculptor for the planned statue in the center of the memorial.  They received 101 entries and chose six finalists.  Of the six, Rudulph Evans was chosen as the main sculptor and Adolph A. Weinman was chosen to sculpt the pediment relief situated above the entrance. Landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. designed the memorial landscape. The Olmsted planting plan installed at the time of construction featured a simple design within a circular driveway; primarily evergreen trees with limited flowering trees and shrubs. The design was perceived as too thin, so white pines were added and some other plantings took place before the dedication in 1943. Many changes to Olmsted's plans occurred in the 1970s, while 1993 and 2000 restorations have attempted to restore integrity to Olmsted's altered design. President Roosevelt ordered trees to be cut so that the view of the memorial from the White House would be enhanced; additional tree pruning was completed to create an unobstructed view between the Jefferson Memorial and Lincoln Memorial. The Jefferson Memorial was officially dedicated by President Roosevelt on April 13, 1943, the 200th anniversary of Jefferson's birthday. At that time, Evans' statue had not yet been finished.  Due to material shortages during World War II, the statue that was installed at the time was a plaster cast of Evans' work painted to look like bronze.  The finished bronze statue was installed in 1947, having been cast by the Roman Bronze Works of New York. As a National Memorial it was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966."

        "content": "The interior of the memorial has a  tall,  bronze statue of Jefferson by the sculptor Rudulph Evans. The statue was added four years after the dedication. Most prominent are the words which are inscribed in a frieze below the dome: \"I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.\" This sentence is taken from a letter written by Jefferson on September 23, 1800, to Dr. Benjamin Rush wherein he defends the constitutional refusal to recognize a state religion. On the panel of the southwest interior wall are excerpts from the Declaration of Independence, written in 1776: We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men. We ... solemnly publish and declare, that these colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states ... And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence, we mutually pledge our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor. The inscription uses the word \"inalienable\", as in Jefferson's draft, rather than \"unalienable\", as in the published Declaration. On the panel of the northwest interior wall is an excerpt from the 1777 Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, except for the last sentence, which is taken from a letter of August 28, 1789, to James Madison: Almighty God hath created the mind free ... All attempts to influence it by temporal punishments or burthens ... are a departure from the plan of the Holy Author of our religion ... No man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship or ministry or shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief, but all men shall be free to profess and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion. I know but one code of morality for men whether acting singly or collectively. The quotes from the panel of the northeast interior wall are from multiple sources. The first sentence, beginning \"God who gave ...\", is from A Summary View of the Rights of British America.  The second, third and fourth sentences are from Notes on the State of Virginia. The fifth sentence, beginning \"Nothing is more ...\", is from Jefferson's autobiography. The sixth sentence, beginning \"Establish the law ...\", is from a letter of August 13, 1790, to George Wythe. The final sentence is from a letter of January 4, 1786, to George Washington: God who gave us life gave us liberty. Can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just, that his justice cannot sleep forever. Commerce between master and slave is despotism. Nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate than these people are to be free. Establish the law for educating the common people. This it is the business of the state to effect and on a general plan. The inscription on the panel of the southeast interior wall is redacted and excerpted from a letter of July 12, 1816, to Samuel Kercheval: I am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions. But laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times. We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors."

The hotel property is bounded by rue Saint Louis to the north, and rue Mont Carmel to the south. Terrasse Dufferin is a terrace that wraps around the hotel from the northeast to the southeast, overlooking the Saint Lawrence River. Two public roads run through the hotel, rue du Tr\u00e9sor, and rue des Carri\u00e8res. The hotel building was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada, known as the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac National Historic Site of Canada. The area was designated as a National Historic Site in January 1981. Located near the edge of the promontory of Quebec, the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac is situated near several major historic attractions within the historic district of Old Quebec's Upper Town. To the northeast of the hotel lies the Ursulines Monastery of Quebec, a 17th-century monastery founded by a missionary group of Ursuline nuns, and another National Historic Site of Canada. To the south of the hotel lies the Plains of Abraham, a historic area within The Battlefields Park, and the site of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. Another major attraction south of the hotel is the Citadelle of Quebec, situated at the atop Cap Diamant, an elevated point of the promontory. The Citadelle serves as an active military installation for the Canadian Armed Forces, as well as a secondary official residence for the Canadian monarch and the Governor General of Canada. East of the hotel lies the Terrasse Dufferin, and Old Quebec's Lower Town directly below it. The Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac was not the first hotel built on the site. The first hotel was built during the 1780s, and was known as the Ch\u00e2teau Haldimand, named after the Governor of Quebec who ordered the hotel's construction. That hotel was later demolished to make way for the present hotel."

        "content": "The Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac is one of Canada's grand railway hotels built by the Canadian Pacific Railway. The Ch\u00e2teauesque architectural style used throughout the hotel would later serve as a template for other Canadian grand railway hotels erected in the late-19th to early-20th century. The central fortress-like tower design is derived from medieval chateaus found throughout France's Loire Valley. Ch\u00e2teauesque elements include the hotel's asymmetrical profile, with steeply pitched roofs, massive circular and polygonal towers and turrets, ornate gables and dormers, and tall chimneys. The exterior base of the hotel is largely made of grey stone ashlar, with steel framing running up the building, Glenboig brick cladding. Materials that make up the interior of the building includes mahogany panelling, marble staircases, carved stone, wrought iron, and glass roundels. However, as opposed the other Ch\u00e2teauesque-styled buildings found in France, the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac did not utilize elements of Italianate architecture, instead placing a greater emphasis on Gothic elements. The hotel also draws certain elements from Victorian style of architecture, with rich polychromatic surfaces throughout its exterior. Built in 1892\u201393, the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac was originally designed by architect Bruce Price. Price's plan called for a horseshoe-shaped hotel, made up of four wings of unequal length, connected at obtuse angles. Public rooms made up the majority of the first two floors of Price's designs. The original proposal called for a square structure, however the completion of the Terrasse Dufferin led to the development for a more picturesque building. Since its completion, the hotel has undergone several major expansions and renovations led by several different architects and architectural firms. William Sutherland Maxwell led two major expansions to the hotel, one in 1908\u201309, and another in 1920\u201324 (co-led with his brother, Edward Maxwell). Renovations in the 1990s was led by the Arcop, an architectural firm based in Montreal. The hotel was again expanded in 1993, with the addition of a new wing. Access to the hotel's main entrance is marked by several porte-coch\u00e8re with large dormers and a cupola. The porte-coch\u00e8re leads guests into the hotel's centre courtyard, as well as the entrance to the hotel's main lobby. The building stands , containing 18 floors primarily made up of guest rooms and other hotel amenities. After the addition of the tallest tower in 1924, the hotel became the tallest building in Quebec City. It remained the city's tallest building until 1930, when \u00c9difice Price was completed just northwest of the hotel. Although several buildings in Quebec City are taller, the hotel continues to hold a prominent position in the city's skyline, as it is perched atop a tall cape overlooking the Saint Lawrence River."

One of the contributors to this project was Lord Dufferin, who supervised the construction of the old city wall and many public buildings that followed the theme of old, medieval, European Quebec. Dufferin also made a plan to reconstruct the Chateau Saint-Louis which was located on the cape where the Chateau Frontenac currently stands and served as the home of the French governors from 1620 to 1834. Dufferin's plan did not take off until the City Council and the Board of Trade adopted the idea and planned to instead construct a grand hotel on the site to attract upper-class tourism to the area, but after failing to finance its construction, businessmen from Toronto and Montreal with connections to the Canadian Pacific Railway took control of the project."

The hotel was a part of a series of Chateauesque-styled hotels built for the Canadian Pacific Railway company during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The last of the Canadian Pacific Railway's Chateauesque hotels was completed in 1908, leaving the rival company Grand Trunk Railway to continue the trend. The hotel was expanded in 1924 to designs by William Sutherland Maxwell. The 1924 expansion saw the addition of the hotel's central tower. The hotel was named after Louis de Buade, Count of Frontenac, who was the Governor General of New France from 1672 to 1682, and again from 1689 to 1698. The World War II Allies met during the First and Second Quebec Conference (in 1943 and 1944 respectively). During these conferences, officials including American President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, discussed strategy for World War II. In 1953, this hotel was used as the filming location for the final scene in Alfred Hitchcock's film I Confess, featuring Montgomery Clift and Anne Baxter. In 1993, the hotel saw another expansion, with the addition of the new wing that included a pool, fitness centre, and outdoor terrace. On June 14, 1993, Canada Post issued 'Le Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac, Qu\u00e9bec' designed by Kosta Tsetsekas, based on illustrations by Heather Price. The $C0.43 stamp features an image of the hotel building, and is perforated 13.5 and printed by Ashton-Potter Limited. In 2001, the hotel was sold to Legacy REIT, which is partially owned by Fairmont, for $185 million. The hotel was renamed the Fairmont Le Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac in November 2001, shortly after Canadian Pacific Hotels reformed itself as Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, taking the name of an American company it acquired in 2001. In 2011, the hotel was sold to Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge. Shortly after acquiring the hotel, Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge announced an investment of $9 million for the restoration of the building's masonry work, and the replacement of the building's copper roofs. The company further announced another $66 million investment for general improvements and renovations throughout the hotel. When the roof was being replaced, an image of the roof was printed on polypropylene safety netting and hung from scaffolding to hide the refurbishing project from view. The extensive renovation saw conference rooms expanded, restaurants remodeled, modernization of the lobby, and the gutting and rebuilding of three-fifths of the hotel's rooms. The hotel was featured in the 2016 Korean drama Guardian: The Lonely and Great God."

After investigating suitable sites, including Piccadilly, an oddly shaped plot facing Albert Square was chosen. The Albert Square frontage measures , Lloyd Street is , Princess Street the longest at  and Cooper Street measures . On this tight site, the corporation built a grand hall, a suite of reception rooms, quarters for the lord mayor, offices and a council chamber. The second stage of a competition to design the town hall which attracted 137 entries was judged by Thomas Leverton Donaldson, a classicist, and gothicist George Edmund Street. The eight finalists were Waterhouse, William Lee, Speakman & Charlesworth, Cuthbert Brodrick, Thomas Worthington, John Oldrid Scott, Thomas Henry Wyatt and Edward Salomons. In terms of design and aesthetics, Waterhouse's proposal was placed fourth behind those of Speakman & Charlesworth, Oldrid Scott and Worthington but his design was considered far superior in architectural quality, layout and use of light and he was appointed architect on 1 April 1868. The foundation stone was laid on 26 October 1868 by the Mayor, Robert Neill. Construction took nine years and used 14 million bricks. Estimates for the cost of construction vary from \u00a3775,000 to around \u00a31,000,000 translating to between \u00a3 and \u00a3 in . When Queen Victoria refused to attend, Manchester Town Hall was opened on 13 September 1877 by the mayor, Abel Heywood, who had championed the project."

        "content": "The rapid growth and accompanying pollution in Victorian cities caused great problems for architects including denial of light, overcrowding, awkward sites, noise, accessibility and visibility of buildings, and air pollution. Provision for \"the sufficiency of window light supplied throughout the building\" was addressed by the use of architectural devices: suspended first floor rooms, made possible by the use of iron-framed construction, skylights, extra windows and dormers, \"borrowed lights\" for interior spaces and glazed white bricks in conjunction with mosaic marble paving in areas where the light was \"less strong\". Clear glass was used in important rooms, with light-coloured tints for coloured glazing, as \"the sky of Manchester does not favour the employment of deeply stained glass.\" The building exemplifies the Victorian Gothic revival style of architecture, using themes and elements from 13th-century Early English Gothic architecture. Gothic features most prominent in the Manchester Town Hall are low rib vault ceilings and tall arched windows. The choice of the Gothic was influenced by the wish for a spiritual acknowledgement of Manchester's late medieval heritage in the textile trade of the Hanseatic league and an affirmation of modernity in the fashionable neo-Gothic style favoured over the Neoclassical architecture of Liverpool. Despite its medieval styling, the building was designed to support the practical technologies of the 19th century. It had gas lighting, and a warm-air heating system, which provided fresh air drawn through ornamental stone air inlets below the windows and admitted behind the hot water pipes and 'coils' into the rooms. Warmed, fresh air was fed into the stairwells and through hollow shafts within the spiral staircases to ventilate the corridors. Pipes supplying gas for lighting were ingeniously concealed underneath the banister rails of the spiral staircases. Waterhouse designed the building structure to be fireproof, using a combination of concrete and wrought-iron beams."

        "content": "In mid-19th-century Manchester, many important Georgian buildings were blackened by atmospheric pollution. By the 1870s the local soft red Collyhurst sandstone was deemed to be unsuitable for public buildings, and tough Pennine sandstones were preferred. The architectural competition entries were judged in part on their suitability for the \"climate of the district\", and sample stone types were investigated. Waterhouse believed it was a matter of great difficulty to find a stone \"proof against the evil influences of the peculiar climate of Manchester\" but decided that the Bradford Dale-quarried Spinkwell Stone and Bolton Woods Stone/Gaisby Rock/Elland Flags stone would resist \"the deleterious influences of Manchester atmosphere\". The interior decoration was chosen with a view to providing permanent colour and cleanable surfaces. Public corridors were faced with terracotta rather than plaster, and extensive use was made of stone vaulted ceilings, tiled dados and washable mosaic floors. Waterhouse's design used a Gothic style with limited carved decoration and a uniform colour, a departure from the high Victorian heaviness and colour used in contemporary Ruskinian Gothic buildings, and was criticised by some Manchester inhabitants for not being Gothic enough. The decision to spend large amounts of money on a building \"when most of its architectural effect would be lost because ruined by soot and made nearly invisible by smoke\" was criticised. Waterhouse avoided using a polychrome scheme as seen in High Victorian Gothic buildings such as St Pancras railway station believing it to be impractical as Manchester's industrial atmosphere would quickly ruin the effect and decided a uniform stone exterior was the better solution. Statues of notable figures in the city's history decorate its exterior, that of Agricola, founder of the Roman fort is over the main door and over its gable is a statue of St George. Statues of Thomas Grelley, first lord of the manor, Humphrey Chetham and Thomas de la Warre are among six at the corner of Albert Square and Princess Street. Waterhouse's design proved successful and although its exterior was blackened by the late 1890s, the stonework was in a suitable condition to be cleaned and restored to its original appearance in the late 1960s."

The Palace of Fine Arts was designed by Bernard Maybeck, who was tasked with creating a building that would serve as a quiet zone where exhibition attendees could pass through between visiting the crowded fairgrounds and viewing the paintings and sculptures displayed in the building behind the rotunda. Maybeck designed what was essentially a fictional ruin from another time, taking his inspiration from Roman and Ancient Greek architecture (specifically Piranesi's etching of the remnants of the so-called Temple of Minerva Medica in Rome), and also from B\u00f6cklin's symbolist painting Isle of the Dead. While most of the exposition was demolished when the exposition ended, the Palace was so beloved that a Palace Preservation League, founded by Phoebe Apperson Hearst, was founded while the fair was still in progress. For a time the Palace housed a continuous art exhibit, and during the Great Depression, W.P.A. artists were commissioned to replace the decayed Robert Reid murals on the ceiling of the rotunda. From 1934 to 1942 the exhibition hall was home to eighteen lighted tennis courts. During World War\u00a0II, it was requisitioned by the military for storage of trucks and jeeps. At the end of the war, when the United Nations was created in San Francisco, limousines used by the world's statesmen came from a motor pool there. From 1947 on the hall was put to various uses: as a city Park Department warehouse; as a telephone book distribution center; as a flag and tent storage depot; and even as temporary Fire Department headquarters. While the Palace had been saved from demolition, its structure was not stable. Originally intended to only stand for the duration of the Exhibition, the colonnade and rotunda were not built of durable materials, and thus framed in wood and then covered with staff, a mixture of plaster and burlap-type fiber. As a result of the construction and vandalism, by the 1950s the simulated ruin was in fact a crumbling ruin. In 1964, the original Palace was completely demolished, with only the steel structure of the exhibit hall left standing. The buildings were then reconstructed until 1974 in permanent, light-weight, poured-in-place concrete, and steel I-beams were hoisted into place for the dome of the rotunda. All the decorations and sculpture were constructed anew. The only changes were the absence of the murals in the dome, two end pylons of the colonnade, and the original ornamentation of the exhibit hall. In 1969, the former Exhibit Hall became home to the Exploratorium interactive museum, and, in 1970, also became the home of the 966-seat Palace of Fine Arts Theater. In 2003, the City of San Francisco along with the Maybeck Foundation created a public-private partnership to restore the Palace and by 2010 work was done to restore and seismically retrofit the dome, rotunda, colonnades and lagoon. In January 2013, the Exploratorium closed in preparation for its permanent move to the Embarcadero. In 1992 and 1996, the popular U.S. game show Wheel of Fortune taped shows at the Palace for broadcast in the months of November. In April 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, plans were announced to convert the Palace of Fine Arts into a temporary shelter for 162 homeless people. The decision was reversed shortly afterwards, following protests by residents of the neighboring wealthy Marina neighborhood and concerns that the lodging conditions would be inadequate. Today, Australian eucalyptus trees fringe the eastern shore of the lagoon. Many forms of wildlife have made their home there including swans, ducks (particularly migrating fowl), geese, turtles, frogs, and raccoons."

Thomas Paty, later a notable Bristol architect, worked as a mason during its construction. The house stands on a steep slope, so that while only three stories face the street, the five-bay garden front is four stories tall with low wings (both raised from one story to two during the nineteenth century) and a double flight of steps down to the garden. There is a World War II Air raid shelter accessible beneath the steps which is visible from the South Fa\u00e7ade. Before 1850, the far end of the garden was sold and built into the Bellevue terrace. Original rococo plasterwork, by Joseph Thomas, survives in a number of interior rooms. The Symonds Music Room, which adjoins the Drawing Room, was constructed in the 1850s and extends beyond the left point of the south fa\u0107ade. The vantage point of the house offered a view of the Avon, of the city of Bristol, and of the Bath hills. The house was later home to the nineteenth century 'man-of-letters', John Addington Symonds, whose father had bought the house in 1851. May Staveley bought the house assisted by her supporters from the Symonds family in 1909 to create the first hall of residence for women in south-west England. In 1911, the university took over the running of the house and they bought the adjacent Callandar House, which dates from the late 18th century and is itself grade II listed. Callandar House was extended in the 1920s thanks to the Wills family (regular benefactors to the university) and, along with Old Clifton, continued to house only female residents. Additional land was acquired and in the early 1960s Fry Wing was constructed on 5 floors (\"A\" to \"E\" floors) with South Wing following some 10 years later with its 4 floors (\"D\" to \"G\" floors). Clifton Hill House now houses approximately 230 students in total, of all genders. There is a Junior Common Room with a stage and bar.

The building, which was in the Gothic style, served as the seat of government and also housed a number of shops on the ground floor. The -tall Torre Bissara precedes this structure, as it is known from as early as 1172; however, its height was increased on this occasion, and its pinnacle was finished in 1444. It has five bells in the chord of E. The 15th-century edifice had an upside-down cover, partly supported by large archivolts, inspired by the one built in 1306 for the eponymous building of Padua. The Gothic fa\u00e7ade was in red and gialletto marble of Verona, and is still visible behind the Palladio addition. A double order of columns was built by Tommaso Formenton in 1481\u20131494 to surround the palace. However, two years after its completion, the south-western corner collapsed. In the following decades, the Vicentine government called in architects such as Antonio Rizzo, Giorgio Spavento, Antonio Scarpagnino, Jacopo Sansovino, Sebastiano Serlio, Michele Sanmicheli and Giulio Romano to propose a reconstruction plan. In 1546, the Council of One Hundred chose a 40-year-old local architect, Andrea Palladio, to reconstruct the building starting from April 1549. Palladio added a new outer shell of marble classical forms, a loggia and a portico that now obscure the original Gothic architecture. He also dubbed the building a \"basilica\", after the ancient Roman civil structures of that name. The Basilica was an expensive project (some 60,000 ducats once finished) and took a long time to complete.  Palladio received for the work an income of five ducats a month for most of his life. In 1614\u2014thirty years after his death\u2014the building was completed, with the finishing of the main fa\u00e7ade on Piazza delle Erbe."

        "content": "Drawings by Palladio, from his original proposal of 1546 to the final construction, have been preserved. His solution, which also encompasses the necessary measure to adapt the addition to the pre-existing structure, is based on the so-called serliana: this is a repetitive structure in which round arches are flanked by rectangular openings; the latter were of different size, in order to match the variable size of the internal bay.  In the angular arcades, the architrave openings become very narrow. The serliana had been already used in the Veneto some years before by Jacopo Sansovino for his Biblioteca Marciana (1537), as well as in the reconstruction of the Polirone Abbey by Giulio Romano (1540). The loggias in the lower floor were in the Doric order; the associated entablature has a frieze which alternates metope (decorated by dishes and bucrania) and triglyphs. The upper-floor loggias, by contrast, are in the Ionic order, with a continuous frieze entablature. The parapet has statues by Giovanni Battista Albanese, Grazioli and Lorenzo Rubini. The clocktower has five bells in the chord of E major."

        "content": "The building was conceived by Lt. Commander J.W. Hobbs, an entrepreneur from Toronto. Hobbs recognized that the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 would greatly increase Vancouver's importance as a commercial port, and decided that the city needed a grand, iconic building, in the venue of the newly constructed Chrysler Building in New York. The design was assigned to McCarter Nairne and Partners, who had never worked on the design of a skyscraper before. Construction started on March 13, 1929 as reported by a local newspaper: The building was completed on 7 October 1930. At  (22 floors) it was the tallest skyscraper in the city until 1939. According to the architects, McCarter & Nairne, the building was intended to evoke \"some great crag rising from the sea, clinging with sea flora and fauna, tinted in sea-green, touched with gold.\" The building cost $2.3 million to build \u2013 $1.1 million over budget\u2014but due to the Great Depression it was sold to the Guinness family of Ireland for only $900,000. The 2016 property assessment is $90 million. There was an observation deck, but during the depression in the 1930s the 25-cent admission price proved unaffordable for most. Currently, there are no public galleries in the building. Inside the massive brass-doored elevators the walls are inlaid with 12 varieties of local hardwoods. All over the walls and polished brass doors are depictions of sea snails, skate, crabs, turtles, carp, scallops, seaweed and sea horses, as well as the transportation means of the era. The floor presents the zodiac signs. The exterior is studded with flora and fauna, tinted in sea-green and touched with gold. During a renovation from 1982-1989 to update the electrical, mechanical and air-conditioning systems, the \"battleship linoleum\" (imported from Scotland) in the lobby was replaced with marble. The former Merchant Exchange was also gutted, and is now a restaurant called Tractor Foods.  This building was also the management centre for Oneworld, of one of the three largest airline alliances in the world, from its founding in May 2000 until it was relocated to New York City in June 2011."

It is considered a major monument in architectural history, and was a turning point in Neutra's career. It is often described as the first steel frame house in the United States, and also an early example of the use of gunite (sprayed-on concrete).

It was included in the 1932 exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York that retrospectively defined the style. In essence it reflects Neutra's interest in industrial production, and this is most evident in the repetitive use of factory-made window assemblies. In fact, Neutra's apprentice Harwell Hamilton Harris suggested that Neutra was drawn to America because of Henry Ford. The interior reflects Neutra's interest in Cubism, transparency, and hygiene. The \"minimal\" detailing shows the influence of Irving Gill. In another nod to industrial production, Neutra installed two Ford Model-A headlights in the main stairwell. (The headlights were provided by Neutra apprentice Gregory Ain.)

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade\u00a0I listed building, and described in the list as \"one of the finest surviving 18th-century town halls\".  The authors of the Buildings of England series refer to its \"magnificent scale\", and consider it to be \"probably the grandest\u00a0...suite of civic rooms in the country\", and \"an outstanding and complete example of late Georgian decoration\". It is not an administrative building but a civic suite, Lord Mayor's parlour and Council chamber; local government administration is centred at the nearby Cunard Building. The town hall was built between 1749 and 1754 to a design by John Wood the Elder replacing an earlier town hall nearby. An extension to the north designed by James Wyatt was added in 1785. Following a fire in 1795 the hall was largely rebuilt and a dome designed by Wyatt was built. Minor alterations have subsequently been made. The streets surrounding its site have altered since its initiation, notably when viewed from Castle Street, the south-side, it appears as off-centre. This is because Water Street which ran to the junction with Dale Street, the west-east axis, was continuous and built up across the junction so that the town hall was not visible originally from that aspect. The structures were removed 150 years after this to expose the building from this position. The ground floor contains the city's Council Chamber and a Hall of Remembrance for the Liverpool servicemen killed in the First World War. The upper floor consists of a suite of lavishly decorated rooms which are used for a variety of events and functions. Conducted tours of the building are arranged for the general public and the hall is licensed for weddings."

        "content": "The first recorded town hall in Liverpool was in 1515 and it was probably a thatched building. and was located in the block bounded by High Street, Dale Street & Exchange Street East. It was replaced in 1673 by a building slightly to the south of the present town hall. This town hall stood on \"pillars and arches of hewen stone\" and under it was the exchange for merchants and traders to carry out their business. Building of the present town hall began in 1749 on a site slightly to the north of its predecessor; its foundation stone was laid on 14\u00a0September. The architect was John Wood the Elder, who has been described as \"one of the outstanding architects of the day\".  It was completed and opened in 1754. The ground floor acted as the exchange, and a council room and other offices were on the upper floor.  The ground floor had a central courtyard surrounded by Doric colonnades but it was \"dark and confined, and the merchants preferred to transact business in the street outside\".  Above the building was a large square dome with a cupola. The town hall was bombarded by striking seamen during the 1775 Liverpool Seamen's Revolt. The very last act of the American Civil War was when Captain Waddell walked up the steps of the town hall in November 1865 with a letter to present to the mayor surrendering his vessel, the CSS Shenandoah, to the British government. Improvements began in 1785 with an extension to the north designed by James Wyatt. Buildings close to the west and north sides were demolished, and John Foster prepared plans for the west fa\u00e7ade. In 1786 Wood's square dome was demolished and plans were made by Wyatt for a new dome over the central courtyard. In 1795, before the new dome was built, the hall was seriously damaged by a fire. Wyatt's north extension was not significantly damaged, but Wood's original building was gutted. The building was reconstructed and Wyatt's new dome was added. The work was supervised by Foster and completed in 1802. Under the dome the central courtyard was replaced with a hall containing a staircase. In 1811 a portico was added to the south side. The construction and decoration of the interior was completed by about 1820. In 1881 an attempt to blow up the town hall by the Fenians was aborted.  In 1899\u20131900 the portico on the north face was rebuilt and extended, and the northern extension was enlarged to form a recess in the Council Chamber for the Lord Mayor's chair, this was the work of the borough surveyor Thomas Shelmerdine.  In 1921 a room on the ground floor was made into the Hall of Remembrance to commemorate the military men from Liverpool who died in the First World War.  Part of the building was damaged in the Liverpool Blitz of 1941; this restored after the end of the Second World War.  Further restoration was carried out between 1993 and 1995. Between 2014 and 2015 the exterior of the building was renovated as part of a \u00a3400,000 project. The work included repairing bomb damage from the 1941 Blitz and cleaning the sandstone from the effects of pollution."

The northern facade on these stories contains intermittent limestone cladding with brick. Above the 20th story, the west, south, and east facades are designed identically and are each six bays wide. On these facades, the two center bays are flanked by wide piers and separated by a narrow pier, with recessed spandrels separating the windows on each floor. Within the four outer bays on each facade, the windows on different stories are separated by horizontal bands. In the center bays from the 36th to 39th stories, the piers contain horizontal bands. The spandrels beneath the 36th and 37th floors contain black vertical lines, and there are balconies on the 38th floor. At the 39th floor are black-and-white sunburst motifs flanking a round window in the center bays. The roof above the 40th floor contains friezes with black-and-white triangles and zigzag patterns. The northern facade is similar but has no windows in the center two bays. Additionally, there is no balcony on the 38th floor, and the 39th and 40th floors have dark geometric patterns without any windows."

        "content": "The lowest six stories were reserved for shops or art galleries. According to The New York Times, the base was designed to provide \"salon shop space\". Tenants could occupy ground-level storefronts on 57th Street or Madison Avenue, as well as space on the second through sixth floors above their respective storefronts. Each space could be served by its own elevator and circular stair. The arrangement of vertical storefronts and the lobby's design were intended to \"give the greatest attraction to the exteriors of the shops\", according to Douglas Grant Scott of the United States Realty and Construction Company, the Fuller Company's parent corporation. Rents for the stores was initially calculated by averaging the rates for the first through sixth floors; in typical buildings, space on higher floors was subjected to lower rates than space on lower floors. In the years after its opening, many galleries were opened on the storefronts in the lowest six floors. The Fuller Building became \"one of Manhattan's most prestigious gallery addresses\", as The New York Times described it. The gallery tenants over the years have included the Nailya Alexander Gallery, Andrew Crispo, the Charles Egan Gallery, Andr\u00e9 Emmerich, Hammer Galleries, Marlborough-Gerson, Pierre Matisse, the Katharina Rich Perlow Gallery, and the Zabriskie Gallery. Other gallery occupants have included the Kent Fine Art Gallery, Jan Krugier, David McKee, Robert Miller, the Tibor de Nagy Gallery, and Joan Washburn. The 7th to 15th stories were designed as spaces for interior decorators and art dealers to sell merchandise. The 16th to 40th stories were designed as offices. The Fuller offices on the 16th through 19th stories were trimmed extensively in teakwood and had private elevator service. At the roof, Walker and Gillette designed an eleven-room penthouse apartment for J. H. Carpenter, president of the Fuller Construction Company at the time of the building's completion. The offices were built with cement floors, white plaster walls, and steel-and-glass partitions, while the corridors had marble and terrazzo floors."

Unlike other architecture firms of the time, Fuller's firm intended to handle all aspects of building construction except for the design, similar to the modern general contractor. Following Fuller's death in 1900, his son-in-law Harry S. Black took over as president of the Fuller Company and made it a subsidiary of the new United States Realty and Construction Company. Shortly after Fuller's death, Black constructed what is now the Flatiron Building at Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street for the company's headquarters. That structure was supposed to be called the \"Fuller Building\" in honor of the late Fuller, but its triangular flatiron shape led to the popular name \"Flatiron Building\" instead. By the 1920s, the center of business in Manhattan had moved northward to Midtown."

The United States Realty and Construction Company founded a subsidiary, the GAF Realty Company, to construct a 30-story building on the site. The board of GAR Realty consisted of officers from the National City Bank of New York and the Fuller Company, which were to occupy the building. Walker and Gillette were hired to draw the plans. The plans were revised to 39 stories by September 1929, when the official blueprints were filed with the Manhattan Bureau of Buildings. To fund the construction, United States Realty sold $5 million in bonds and $3 million from debentures in January 1929. The Fuller Company planned to name the new structure \"Fuller Building\", transferring the name from the Flatiron Building. The Fuller Company labeled both entrances of its new building prominently, likely in an attempt to prevent the structure from being mislabeled like its predecessor had been. In June 1929, twenty-four mechanics received craftsmanship awards for their work on the Fuller Building. The building was completed on September 7, 1929. Two days later, the Fuller Company moved its offices to the 16th through 19th floors of the building, becoming its first tenant."

Storefront and basement space was also leased to Sally Gowns Inc. and McGibben & Co., both clothing companies, and Edward Garratt Inc., furniture dealer. Galleries moved to the building as well, including the F. Kleinberger Galleries, the Pierre Matisse Gallery, the French Art Galleries, and manuscript and autograph dealer Thomas F. Madigan Inc. The office story tenants included the French Consul, food processor Standard Brands, book publisher Jordanoff Aviation Corporation, developer Paul Tishman, financier Frederick Lewisohn, former New York governor Herbert H. Lehman, and businessman Bernard Baruch. A committee was formed in 1935 to protect the interests of the building's bondholders. The Penroy Realty Company. led by Miami-based realtor Kenneth S. Keyes, bought the building on behalf of \"out-of-town\" investors in January 1949. At the time, the Fuller Construction Company still maintained its executive offices there. Shortly afterward, the building received a $3 million first mortgage from Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance.  In January 1961, investor Lawrence Wien purchased the building's 33-year lease from the Fuller Building Corporation, with two options for 25-year renewals. Four months later, a syndicate headed by Irving Brodsky and Richard Gittlin bought a 99-year leasehold for the land from the Fuller Building Corporation.  Leases on , about half of the office space, were set to expire in 1962, and it was renting at a rate below the average for the neighborhood. As a result, the owners decided to renovate the building's mechanical features such as acoustical ceilings, fluorescent lighting, and air conditioning. Simultaneously, new or existing tenants signed leases for the remaining office space. In 1968, Brodsky signed a contract to purchase the Fuller Building on behalf of the Fred F. French Company, which paid cash to cover the $4.2 million mortgage. By the late 20th century, the Fuller Building had become a center for art galleries. Not only was 57th Street still an artistic hub, but also, building management was willing to accommodate each gallery's specific needs, such as large doorways, minimal window space, and heavy floor slabs. Accordingly, by the 1970s, much of the showroom space on the lowest six floors was used mostly by galleries. The building's retail space also remained popular despite being split across multiple levels. As Carter B. Horsley wrote for The New York Times in 1978, the building was one of the few in the city \"that have been successful in maintaining more than two retail floors\", aside from specialty buildings. The Fuller Company continued to occupy the building until the early 1980s. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the exterior and lobby interior as city landmarks in 1986."

While the Fuller Building contained over twenty art galleries at the time, several gallery tenants expressed frustration that rents at the building were much higher compared to other buildings. By the beginning of 1994, the Fuller Building was more than 25 percent vacant. Within the same year, the office space remained vacant but much of the available gallery space was occupied. The mortgage holder L&B Group retook the building in December 1994 and subsequently started renovating the building. The changes included replacement windows, a facade cleaning, and upgrading the interior to modern standards. By then, the Fuller Building had been overshadowed by the construction of the much taller Four Seasons Hotel on the adjacent lot, which had been completed in 1993. In August 1999, Vornado Realty Trust arranged to purchase the Fuller Building for approximately $125 million, and the next month, the company closed on its purchase. Vornado announced in 2002 that it planned to renovate the base to designs by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, though this plan received some opposition. The proposal called for replacing the glass above the main entrance with \"electronic glass\", which could alternate between being transparent or opaque, as well as adding similar glass above the lobby ceiling. Coach Inc. opened its global flagship store in the building in 2005. Coach abruptly closed its store in January 2020 and a Berluti store opened in the space that December."

        "content": "Our Lady of Mount Carmel, or Virgin of Carmel, is the title given to the Blessed Virgin Mary in her role as patroness of the Carmelite Order, particularly within the Catholic Church. The first Carmelites were Christian hermits living on Mount Carmel in the Holy Land during the late 12th and early to mid-13th century. They built in the midst of their hermitages a chapel which they dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, whom they conceived of in chivalric terms as the \"Lady of the place.\" Our Lady of Mount Carmel was adopted in the 19th century as the patron saint of Chile. Since the 15th century, popular devotion to Our Lady of Mount Carmel has centered on the Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, also known as the Brown Scapular. Traditionally, Mary is said to have given the Scapular to an early Carmelite named Saint Simon Stock (1165-1265). The liturgical feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is celebrated on 16 July. The solemn liturgical feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel was probably first celebrated in England in the later part of the 14th century. Its object was thanksgiving to Mary, the patroness of the Carmelite Order, for the benefits she had accorded to it through its difficult early years. The institution of the feast may have come in the wake of the vindication of their title \"Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary\" at Cambridge, England, in 1374. The date chosen was 17 July; on the European mainland this date conflicted with the feast of St. Alexis, requiring a shift to 16 July, which remains the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel on the Roman Calendar of the Catholic Church. The Latin poem \"Flos Carmeli\" (meaning \"Flower of Carmel\") first appears as the sequence for this Mass."

        "content": "The Carmelite Order was the only religious order to be started in the Crusader States. In the 13th century, some of its people migrated west to England, setting up a chapter and being documented there about 1241\u20131242. A tradition first attested to in the late 14th century says that Saint Simon Stock, believed to be an early English prior general of the Carmelite Order soon after its migration to England, had a vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary in which she gave him the Brown Scapular. This formed part of the Carmelite habit after 1287. In Stock's vision, Mary promised that those who died wearing the scapular would be saved. This is a devotional sacramental signifying the wearer's consecration to Mary and affiliation with the Carmelite order. It symbolizes her special protection and calls the wearers to consecrate themselves to her in a special way. In 1642, a Carmelite named Fr. John Cheron published a document which he said was a 13th-century letter written by Saint Simon Stock's secretary, Peter Swanington. Since the early 20th century, historians have concluded that this letter was forged, likely by Cheron himself. But Stock's vision was long embraced by many promoters of the scapular devotion. The forged Swanington letter claimed that 16 July 1251 was the date of the vision (16 July being the date of the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel), which led for centuries to a strong association between this feast day and the scapular devotion. Based on available historical documentation, the liturgical feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel did not originally have a specific association with the Brown Scapular or the tradition of Stock's vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary. This tradition grew gradually, as did the liturgical cult of St. Simon. The latter has been documented in Bordeaux, where Stock died, from the year 1435; in Ireland and England, from 1458; and in the rest of the Order, from 1564. Historians have long questioned whether Stock had the vision of Mary and the scapular. Although Simon Stock was never officially canonized, his feast day was celebrated in the church. The Carmelite convent of Aylesford, England, was restored and a relic of Saint Simon Stock was placed there in 1951. The saint's feast is celebrated in the places dedicated to him. Also associated with Our Lady of Carmel was a papal bull saying that there was a Sabbatine privilege associated with devotion to the saint; that is, until the late 1970s, the Catholic liturgy for that day mentioned the scapular devotion. Vatican II resulted in scrutiny of the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, as well as that of Saint Simon Stock, because of the historical uncertainties about the origins. The liturgies were revised and, in the 21st century, neither, even in the Carmelite proper, makes reference to the scapular. In Spain and other Spanish-speaking countries, there has been particular devotion to Our Lady of Mount Carmel, who has been adopted as a patron saint of several places, as she has been in other Catholic-majority countries. In addition, Carmen and Mar\u00eda del Carmen have been popular given names for girls in Spanish-speaking countries. An annual festival, known as Mamacha Carmen, is held in the highland Paucartambo District, Peru, featuring a procession with the Virgin and traditional dancers. Veneration of the Virgen del Carmen (often also associated with the Stella Maris) is particularly strong in coastal towns of Spain."

As she says to the servants at the wedding at Cana, \"Do whatever he [Jesus] tells you.\" Carmelites look to the Virgin Mary as a Spiritual Mother.

In some images, she is portrayed as accompanied with angels and persons wearing Brown Scapulars, who plead for her mediation. In 1613, the Church forbade images to be made of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel descending into purgatory, due to errors being preached about certain privileges associated with the Brown Scapular (known as \"the Sabbatine Privilege\"). That privilege appears in the noted Decree of the Holy Office (1613). It was inserted in its entirety (except for the words forbidding the painting of the pictures) into the list of the indulgences and privileges of the Confraternity of the Scapular of Mount Carmel. In the 21st century, the Carmelites do not promote the Sabbatine Privilege. They encourage a belief in Mary's general aid and prayerful assistance for persons beyond death, especially her aid to those who devoutly wear the Brown Scapular, and commend devotion to Mary especially on Saturdays, which are dedicated to her."

When the procession reached the end of the city, a violent earthquake shook the whole district of Palmi, ruining most of the old houses along the way. But, only nine people died out of a population of about 15,000 inhabitants, as almost all of the population had been on the street to watch the procession and were not trapped inside the destroyed buildings. Therefore, the city commemorates the 1894 procession each year, accompanied by firecrackers, lights, and festive stalls. The Catholic Church has officially recognized the miracle.

        "content": "After the establishment of the Diocese of Hildesheim in 815 by Louis the Pious, a Chapel of St. Mary was built on the locations of the modern apse. Bishop Gunthar of Hildesheim, who was in office from 815 to 834, had a small basilica with two round towers built immediately to the south of the chapel, which he dedicated to Saint Cecilia. This served as the original cathedral and Stift church. The first four bishops were buried there. Only traces of the foundations of these two buildings remain. An older Hildesheim parish church probably once stood on the site of the Chapel of Saint Stephen next to the gatehouse at the eastern entrance to the chapel of St. Hellweg, which might date back to Hildegrim of Ch\u00e2lons and his expedition to East Saxony. The cathedral was built in 872 under Bishop Altfrid as a cruciform three-aisled basilica with a two-story westwork. It is an example of Ottonian architecture, with alternating column support and semi circular apses completing the naves. The building suffered severe fire damage in 1046. Bishop Azelin planned to erect a new, larger building further to the west and to extend the nave. His successor, Hezilo of Hildesheim, abandoned this plan and instead built on the old foundations, incorporating the surviving walls into the new building. Further important renovations occurred up to the end of the fourteenth century but did not deviate from the ground plan of Bishop Altfrid's basilica. The northern paradise and the north and south side chapels date from the gothic period and the tower above the crossing from the baroque period. In the nineteenth century, the original westwork was replaced by a Neo-Romanesque two-tower facade, which stood until 1945."

        "content": "During the aerial bombardment of Hildesheim by the RAF and RCAF in World War II, the main building was almost entirely destroyed; only the westwork and the outer walls survived. Of the ancillary buildings, only the Gothic Anne's chapel (), erected in 1321 in the middle of the cathedral's courtyard, was mostly undamaged. It was the only cathedral in Germany that had to be newly consecrated after its reconstruction, on 27 March 1960 by Bishop Heinrich Maria Janssen. The building was rebuilt between 1950 and 1960 in a simplified form. The baroque elements were abandoned in favour of a form which took its cue from the early Romanesque style. The most visible aspect of this on the exterior was that upper stories, and side towers added to the westwork in 1840 were not restored, and the westwork was reconstructed closer to its earlier state based on the model of the westwork of Minden Cathedral. In addition, the gatehouse in front of the westwork was reduced by about half. Otherwise, the exterior appeared as it had done before the destruction \u2013 in particular, the baroque crossing-tower was rebuilt. The reconstruction was carried out under tight constraints. Because of the lack of sandstone tiles, the floor was relaid in marble. The roofs of the nave, transept, and cloisters were cast in concrete and covered with wooden boards on the inside to recall the appearance of ceiling beams. The interior walls, as well as the walls of the nave, were rebuilt in brick and limestone, hidden from view by a dimension stone coating on the outside and by a coat of smooth plaster on the inside. The ground level was raised by 60\u00a0cm, which resulted in the rooms having a squat appearance, especially in the transepts. The columns of the nave were cast in concrete, and the pilasters were coated in sandstone. The reconsecration took until 1960 to complete because of various problems, chiefly the \"Hildesheim Cathedral construction dispute\" (Hildesheimer Dombaustreit), an argument between the Diocese of Hildesheim and the Land of Lower Saxony about the cost of the reconstruction and particularly about whether Lower Saxony was one of the legal successors of the Free State of Prussia which had undertaken to cover the cathedral's building expenses in 1803 (when it was still the Kingdom of Prussia) during the process of German mediatization. The parties reached a settlement in 1957."

Along with technical and conservation measures, there were alterations to the design. The floor was lowered to the original level, the Hezilo and Azelin chandeliers were restored to their places in the nave and the high choir, and Bernward Doors were again mounted facing outwards, behind an antechamber, as originally intended. In addition, a bishop's crypt was created. On 10 January 2010, the cathedral was closed for the work to begin. During the reconstruction, the basilica of St. Godehard served as the bishop's church (cathedra), as it had in the postwar years. The cathedral renovation was the largest church construction project in Germany. The solemn reopening of the cathedral was on 15 August 2014, coinciding with the beginning of the Diocese's 1200 year jubilee."

        "content": "The cathedral building is widely known for the \"Thousand-year Rose\" () which grows outside the building on the outer wall of the apse in the courtyard of the cloisters. The exact age of the rose is no longer precisely known, but the legend of the rose bush claims that it dates to 815. It is an important symbol of Hildesheim - according to folklore, as long as the bush flourishes, Hildesheim will prosper. According to the story, Emperor Louis the Pious had to hold a Mass while out hunting in the middle of the forest. For this purpose, a reliquary of St. Mary which he had with him was hung from the branch of a wild rose. After the mass, the reliquary could not be removed from the branch. The Emperor considered this a sign that the new bishopric should be established here (not in Elze as he had planned) and he should dedicate it to St. Mary, whose symbol is the rose. The existence of the rose bush has been attested for at least four hundred years. The aerial bombardment of 22 March 1945 which damaged the cathedral and the apse also killed the main growth of the rose bush above the ground; under the rubble, only the charred stump of the rose remained. It was thought that the end of the famous rose had come, but the roots were largely intact, and in the spring of 1945 it put out 25 new shoots. The first sparse flowers bloomed in 1947, and by 1948 there were 122 flowers. Since then, the new branches of the \"Thousand-year Rose\" (as it was already known before the bombing) have been marked with little metal signs with the year in which they first appeared. It is believed to be the oldest living rose in the world."

The Bernard bell is in the Bell cemetery in Hamburg and was irreparably damaged during transport there. Two bells were capable of being reused: the historical Apostolica bell of bellfounder Johann Martin Roth of Mainz (1765), which could be integrated into the new peal, and another historic bell of Johann Martin Roth, the Nikolaus bell, which was originally hung in the crossing tower and was moved to the Nordparadies in 2010."

In the lower belfry of the tower hung the three deepest bells (1-3), while the three smaller bells (4\u20136) were in the upper belfry. The new peal (co-ordinated with the bells of the surrounding churches) was a semitone deeper than the original, so the Apostolica bell had to be tuned a semitone lower to fit with the new bells. Since the quarter bells had also been destroyed in the Second World War, the quarter-hour chimes were now struck by bell No. 5, the chime on the hour by bell No.4 and the chime at noon by bell No. 1.

Bell No. 9 will be named after Hedwig of Schlesien (or of Andechs), patron of refugees - since many refugees came to Hildesheim after the Second World War and were crucial in shaping it.

The last Wyndham or Windham of Felbrigg was William Wyndham (died 1810). Much land had been added to the medieval estate in the 17th and 18th centuries. Above the entablature the family arms and the projecting bays bear the words GLORIA DEO IN EXCELSIS in pierced stone, surmounted by heraldic beasts. The last owner of the house, before it passed into National Trust ownership, was Robert Wyndham Ketton-Cremer. His heir, his brother Richard, was killed in action in the Second World War. Robert's memorial to Richard is in the woods behind the house. Robert Wyndham Ketton-Cremer wrote a number of books, particularly about Norfolk, including Felbrigg: the Story of a House, and Norfolk in the Civil War, Faber, 1969. Robert Ketton-Cremer never married, and with no heirs, left the estate to the National Trust on his death in 1969. Part of the estate was acquired by Beeston Hall School.

Two of Ketton-Cremer's godchildren criticised the decision, claiming that a public outing would have been against Ketton-Cremer's wishes and accusing the Trust of using their godfather to generate publicity. The Trust also requested that volunteers wear a badge featuring the charity's logo atop the colours of the LGBT pride flag. Of the house's 350 volunteers, ten refused and were asked to take backstage roles during the campaign. Sections of the press called on the Trust to reverse its decision, and some members cancelled their membership over the issue. The Trust subsequently U-turned on the wearing of badges."

On this site, and constructed between 1871 and 1875, the city built a monumental granite structure designed by Rochester architect Andrew Jackson Warner (1833\u20131910).  The building, now known as the County and City Hall, featured three floors and a large, seven-story clock tower. It held offices for both the City of Buffalo and Erie County. In 1920, the Buffalo Common Council decided, in light of the fact that the population of the city had quadrupled since the construction of County and City Hall forty-five years earlier, that a new building was needed to house the city government of Buffalo. Niagara Square was chosen as it is one of the central components of Joseph Ellicott's original plan of 1804, laid out for the City of Buffalo. From this location, one can see the waterways of Lake Erie and the shores of Ontario in Canada as well as the rest of downtown Buffalo.  On September 16, 1929, construction of the new City Hall began and the building was ultimately completed on November 10, 1931 with the dedication taking place the following summer, on July 1, 1932, commemorating the city's Centennial celebration. When the new City Hall opened and the city offices moved to the present building, the former 1875 County and City Hall became Erie County court offices and was used to hold important city records.  The former  county and city hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976."

        "content": "City Hall was built by the John W. Cowper Company, the same firm who built the Statler Hotel and the Buffalo Athletic Club, also on Niagara Square. The cost of building City Hall was $6,851,546.85 ($ in  dollars) including the architect's fees, making it one of the costliest city halls in the country. City Hall has 32 stories, 26 of which offer usable office space. The total floor area is  and the footprint of the site on Niagara Square is . There are 1,520 windows from the first to the 25th floor. A practical design feature is that all of them open inward, making window washers unnecessary. There are eight elevators to the 13th floor and four to the 25th floor. Curtis Elevator Company furnished the first elevators, with additional elevators supplied later by Otis Elevator Company. There are 5,000 electrical outlets, 5,400 electrical switches and 21 motor driven ventilation fans. Approximately  of copper wire weighing 43 tons, and  or 180 tons of conduit pipe, serve the building, as well as  or five car loads of underfoot conduit. There are either 138 or 143 clocks (counts vary) regulated by a master clock in the basement and 37 fire alarm stations distributed throughout the building. It was originally equipped with 375 telephones and a master switchboard. External illumination was provided from dusk to midnight by 369 flood lights with an average candlepower of 350. City Hall was designed and built with a non-powered air-conditioning system, taking advantage of strong prevailing winds from Lake Erie. Large vents were placed on the west side of the building to catch wind, which would then travel down ducts to beneath the basement, to be cooled by the ground. This cooled air was then vented throughout the building. Winds off the lake were usually strong enough to power air through this system. In the summer of 2006, Buffalo City Hall started undergoing renovations from the 13th floor all the way to the top as the flood lights were replaced; three years later, it was the south wing that started undergoing renovations of its own. Renovations were completed by 2009."

        "content": "Trinity's congregation was founded by German immigrants from Pomerania who began to arrive in Milwaukee in the late 1830s, looking for freedom to practice their traditional Lutheranism without the interference of the Prussian state. They initially followed a pastor from the Buffalo Synod (chiefly fellow Prussian immigrants), but a controversy in 1847 triggered the formation of Trinity congregation, which requested a pastor from the Missouri Synod, also with German roots and language. The Missouri Synod sent E.G.W. Keyl. He set up Trinity's parish structure and established admission policies that were a key factor in the dispute that produced the Wisconsin Synod. Members of the Trinity Church established St. Stephen Lutheran Church in 1853, in order to serve parishioners south of the Menomonee River. These two churches, along with members of St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church, helped to seed a number of other Lutheran churches in the area. Trinity's first building was on 4th Street between Wells and Kilbourn starting in 1847. In 1851 they built a larger frame church at 4th and Wells. In 1869 they moved that church to the site of the current church and built a school. Concordia College began in the school in 1881. By 1878 the congregation needed a larger building. Architect Frederick Velguth designed the building in a combination of High Victorian Gothic with German Gothic styles, with its hallmark the emphasis on vertical, with towers, spires, and lancet windows all pointing toward heaven. Exterior walls are clad in Cream City brick, a distinct light colored brick manufactured locally, along with sandstone details on the fa\u00e7ade. The cruciform structure is  long,  wide, and  tall, with an apse on the east end. It features three towers, the tallest of which is a landmark  spire. Notable of the church's interior is the historic Schuelke organ in the rear gallery, containing some 1,600 pipes. The total cost was $43,500, of which $3,500 was for the organ. The goblet-shaped pulpit is the highlight of the craftsmanship exhibited in the carved woodwork, which was produced by the Wollaeger Brothers woodworking company German architecture of this type is typical of the historic structures found in and around downtown Milwaukee, including parts of the neighboring Pabst Brewery complex. Construction of a new church office building and conference center began in September 2005, after the old office (the former parsonage) was razed the previous year. This addition to the grounds was completed in 2006."

In 1674, the Langue of Aragon built the Church of Our Lady of Pilar adjacent to the auberge. The 1693 Sicily earthquake caused serious damage to the fa\u00e7ade and the southeast face of the auberge, but the damage was later repaired. The church was also damaged, and it was rebuilt in a new design, being completed in 1718. The Auberge has a large underground which was originally used for horses. A water system was installed at some point, possibly after the construction of the Wignacourt Aqueduct. In the 18th century the underground was converted and used as an oven. This part of the Auberge was later buried, probably sometimes in the British period. Initial studies claim that the oven served as a bakery. The access of the underground was substantially altered after the earthquake and the later erection of nearby buildings. After the rediscovery of the bakery, it was decided to restore it and open it to the public."

Two years later, the Maltese Islands became a British protectorate, and the auberge was requisitioned by the Quartermaster. From 1822 to 1824, the building housed the government printing press. In the late 1830s, the building was the residence of the Chief Secretary to Government. In 1842, the auberge was leased to George Tomlinson, the Anglican Bishop of Gibraltar, and the building was known as Gibraltar House. The only major alteration to the auberge, a Doric portico leading to the main doorway, was probably built at this point. After Malta was granted self-government in 1921, the auberge was converted into a school. In 1924, upon Ugo Pasquale Mifsud's election as Prime Minister of Malta, the building became the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM). In 1931, there were plans to move the parliament from the Grandmaster's Palace into the auberge, but nothing materialized. The building continued to house the OPM until the office was abolished upon the suspension of the constitution in 1933. From 1933 to 1939 the building was left vacant. In 1939, the auberge was given to the British Institute. It was used as a hospital for British families during WWII known as the Military Families\u2019 Hospital. A new constitution was granted in 1947, restoring self-government and reestablishing the position of Prime Minister. At this point the British Institute moved to nearby Casa Bolino. The auberge was once again used as the OPM, with Paul Boffa being the first Prime Minister to use it as his office. On 16 January 1951, Prime Minister George Borg Olivier presented a small bronze model of Les Gavroches, created by artist Antonio Sciortino, to Princess Elizabeth (now Queen Elizabeth II) in a ceremony held at the building. The islands became independent as the State of Malta in 1964, and the independence was drafted on a table which still remains in the auberge today."

The collection grew so quickly that a dedicated museum seemed attractive and Gropius was asked to design it. In 1964, he produced plans for a new museum in Darmstadt, on the Rosenh\u00f6he, which was prevented by local politics. The Senate of Berlin was however ready to supply both space and money for the project. In 1971 the Bauhaus Archive moved to temporary accommodation in Berlin. Modifying the plans for the location beside the Landwehrkanal, political decisions and financial restrictions delayed things. The foundation stone was finally laid in 1976 and the building was ready by 1979. There is not that much left of Gropius' original 1964 design apart from the characteristic silhouette of the shed roofs. The necessary changes to the plan were carried out by his former colleague Alex Cvijanovi\u0107, in conjunction with the Berlin architect Hans Bandel. In 1997 a conservation order was placed on the building. In 2005 it served as an outdoor set for the science fiction action films V for Vendetta and \u00c6on Flux. As space only permits exhibition of 35 percent of the museum's holdings, the Bauhaus Archive invited six architectural firms to participate in a co-operative competition: Diener & Diener (Basle), N\u00e4geli Architekten (Berlin), SANAA (Tokyo), Sauerbruch & Hutton (Berlin), UN Studio (Amsterdam), Volker Staab (Berlin).

        "content": "Sanssouci is a historical building in Potsdam, near Berlin. Built by Prussian King Frederick the Great as his summer palace, it is often counted among the German rivals of Versailles. While Sanssouci is in the more intimate Rococo style and is far smaller than its French Baroque counterpart, it, too, is notable for the numerous temples and follies in the surrounding park. The palace was designed and built by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff between 1745 and 1747 to meet Frederick's need for a private residence where he could escape the pomp and ceremony of the royal court. The palace's name is a French phrase (sans souci) that translates as \"without concerns\", meaning \"without worries\" or \"carefree\", emphasising that the palace was meant as a place of relaxation, rather than a seat of power. Sanssouci is little more than a large, single-story villa\u2014more like the Ch\u00e2teau de Marly than Versailles. Containing just ten principal rooms, it was built on the brow of a terraced hill at the centre of the park. The influence of King Frederick's personal taste in the design and decoration of the palace was so great that its style is characterised as \"Frederician Rococo\", and his feelings for the palace were so strong that he conceived it as \"a place that would die with him\". Because of a disagreement about the site of the palace in the park, Knobelsdorff was fired in 1746. Jan Bouman, a Dutch architect, finished the project. During the 19th century, the palace became a residence of Frederick William IV. He employed the architect Ludwig Persius to restore and enlarge the palace, while Ferdinand von Arnim was charged with improving the grounds and thus the view from the palace. The town of Potsdam, with its palaces, was a favourite place of residence for the German imperial family until the fall of the Hohenzollern dynasty in 1918. After World War II, the palace became a tourist attraction in East Germany. Following German reunification in 1990, Frederick's body was returned to the palace and buried in a new tomb overlooking the gardens he had created. Sanssouci and its extensive gardens became a World Heritage Site in 1990 under the protection of UNESCO; in 1995, the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg was established to care for Sanssouci and the other former imperial palaces in and around Berlin. These palaces are now visited by more than two million people each year from all over the world."

        "content": "The location and layout of Sanssouci above a vineyard reflected the pre-Romantic ideal of harmony between man and nature, in a landscape ordered by human touch. Winemaking, however, was to take second place to the design of the palace and pleasure gardens. The hill on which Frederick created his terrace vineyard was to become the focal point of his demesne, crowned by the new, but small, palace\u2014\"mein Weinbergh\u00e4uschen\" (\"my little vineyard house\"), as Frederick called it. With its extensive views of the countryside in the midst of nature, Frederick wanted to reside there sans souci (\"without a care\") and to follow his personal and artistic interests. Hence, the palace was intended for the use of Frederick and his private guests\u2014his sketch (illustration) indicated the balanced suites \"pour les etrangers\" and \"pour le roy\"\u2014 only during the summer months, from the end of April to the beginning of October. Twenty years following his creation of Sanssouci, Frederick built the New Palace (Neues Palais) in the western part of the park. This far larger palace was in direct contrast to the relaxed ethos behind Sanssouci, and displayed Frederick's power and strength to the world, in the Baroque style. The design of the New Palace was intended to demonstrate that Prussia's capabilities were undiminished despite its near defeat in the Seven Years' War. Frederick made no secret of his intention, even referring to the new construction as his \"fanfaronnade\" (\"showing off\"). This concept of a grand palace designed to impress has led to the comparison of the palaces of Potsdam to Versailles, with Sanssouci being thrust into the role of one of the Trianons. This analogy, though easy to understand, ignores the original merits of the concept behind Sanssouci, the palace for which the whole park and setting were created. Unlike the Trianons, Sanssouci was not an afterthought to escape the larger palace, for the simple reason that the larger palace did not exist at the time of Sanssouci's conception; and once it did, Frederick almost never stayed in the New Palace except on rare occasions when entertaining diplomats he wished to impress. It is true, however, that Sanssouci was intended to be a private place of retreat rather than display of power, strength and architectural merit. Unlike the Trianons, Sanssouci was designed to be a whole unto itself. Sanssouci is small, with the principal block (or corps de logis) being a narrow single-storey enfilade of just ten rooms, including a service passage and staff rooms behind them. Frederick's amateur sketch of 1745 (illustrated above) demonstrates that his architect, Knobelsdorff, was more a draughtsman at Sanssouci than complete architect. Frederick appears to have accepted no suggestions for alteration to his plans, refusing Knobelsdorff's idea that the palace should have a semi-basement storey, which would not only have provided service areas closer at hand, but would have put the principal rooms on a raised piano nobile. This would have given the palace not only a more commanding presence, but also would have prevented the problems of dampness to which it has always been prone. However, Frederick wanted an intimate palace for living: for example, rather than scaling a large number of steps, he wanted to enter the palace immediately from the garden. He insisted on a building on the ground level, of which the pedestal was the hill: in short, this was to be a private pleasure house. His recurring theme and requirement was for a house with close connections between its style and free nature. The principal rooms, lit by tall slender windows, face south over the vineyard gardens; the north fa\u00e7ade is the entrance front, where a semicircular cour d'honneur was created by two segmented Corinthian colonnades. In the park, east of the palace, is the Sanssouci Picture Gallery, built from 1755 to 1764 under the supervision of the architect Johann Gottfried B\u00fcring. It stands on the site of a former greenhouse, where Frederick raised tropical fruit. The Picture Gallery is the oldest extant museum built for a ruler in Germany. Like the palace itself, it is a long, low building, dominated by a central domed bow of three bays. Following the death of Frederick a new era began, a visible sign of which was the change in architectural styles. Neo-Classicism, popular elsewhere in Europe but ignored by Frederick, now found its way to Potsdam and Berlin during the reign of the new king Frederick William II. He ordered the construction of a new palace in the new more fashionable style, and stayed at Sanssouci only occasionally. The reception and bedrooms were renovated and completely altered immediately after Frederick's death. Frederick William von Erdmannsdorff received the commission for the refurbishment. While Frederick had been constructing the New Palace in the Baroque style between 1763 and 1769, Erdmannsdorff, an advocate of the new neo-classical style, had created Schloss W\u00f6rlitz in W\u00f6rlitz Park, the first neo-classical palace in Germany. As a result of his influence, Sanssouci became the first of the palaces in Potsdam and Berlin to be remodelled with a neo-classical interior. In 1797, Frederick William II was succeeded by Frederick William III; he visited Sanssouci even less frequently than did his father, preferring to spend the summer months in Paretz Palace or on the Pfaueninsel in Berlin."

        "content": "It was no coincidence that Frederick selected the Rococo style of architecture for Sanssouci. The light, almost whimsical style then in vogue exactly suited the light-hearted uses for which he required this retreat. The Rococo style of art emerged in France in the early 18th century as a continuation of the Baroque style, but in contrast with the heavier themes and darker colours of the Baroque, the Rococo was characterised by an opulence, grace, playfulness, and lightness. Rococo motifs focused on the carefree aristocratic life and on light-hearted romance, rather than on heroic battles and religious figures. They also revolve around natural and exterior settings; this again suited Frederick's ideal of nature and design being in complete harmony. The palace was completed much as Frederick had envisaged in his preliminary sketches (see illustration above). The palace has a single-storey principal block with two flanking side wings. The building occupies almost the entire upper terrace. The potential monotony of the fa\u00e7ade is broken by a central bow, its dome rising above the hipped roof, with the name of the palace\u2014remarkably, written with a comma and a full stop, viz. Sans, Souci.\u2014 on it in gilded bronze letters. The secondary side wings on the garden front are screened by two symmetrical rows of trees each terminating in free-standing trellised gazebos, richly decorated with gilded ornaments. The garden front of the palace is decorated by carved atlantes and caryatids; grouped in pairs between the windows, these appear to support the balustrade above. Executed in sandstone, these figures of both sexes represent Bacchants, the companions of the wine god Bacchus, and originate from the workshop of the sculptor Friedrich Christian Glume. The same workshop created the vases on the balustrade, and the groups of cherubs above the windows of the dome. By contrast, the north entrance fa\u00e7ade is more restrained. Segmented colonnades of 88 Corinthian columns\u2014two deep\u2014curve outwards from the palace building to enclose the semicircular cour d'honneur. As on the south side, a balustrade with sandstone vases decorates the roof of the main corps de logis. Flanking the corps de logis are two secondary wings, providing the large service accommodation and domestic offices necessary to serve an 18th-century monarch, even when in retreat from the world. In Frederick's time, these single-storey wings were covered with foliage to screen their mundane purpose. The eastern wing housed the secretaries', gardeners' and servants' rooms, while the west wing held the palace kitchen, stables and a remise (coach house). Frederick regularly occupied the palace each summer throughout his lifetime, but after his death in 1786 it remained mostly unoccupied and neglected until the mid-19th century. In 1840, 100 years after Frederick's accession to the throne, his great-grand nephew Frederick William IV and his wife moved into the guest rooms. The royal couple retained the existing furniture and replaced missing pieces with furniture from Frederick's time. The room in which Frederick had died was intended to be restored to its original state, but this plan was never executed because of a lack of authentic documents and plans. However, the armchair in which Frederick had died was returned to the palace in 1843. Frederick William IV, a draftsman interested in both architecture and landscape gardening, transformed the palace from the retreat of his reclusive great uncle into a fully functioning and fashionable country house. The small service wings were enlarged between 1840 and 1842. This was necessary because, while Frederick philosophised and played music at Sanssouci, he liked to live modestly without splendour. As he aged, his modesty developed into miserliness. He would not permit repairs to the outer fa\u00e7ade and allowed them in the rooms only with great reluctance. This was ascribed to his wish that Sanssouci should only last his lifetime. The additions included a mezzanine floor to both wings. The kitchen was moved into the east wing. Frederick the Great's small wine cellar was enlarged to provide ample store rooms for the enlarged household, while the new upper floor provided staff bedrooms. The west wing became known as \"The Ladies' Wing\", providing accommodation for ladies-in-waiting and guests. This was a common arrangement in mid-19th-century households, which often had a corresponding \"Bachelor's Wing\" for unmarried male guests and members of the household. The rooms were decorated with intricate boiseries, panelling and tapestries. This new accommodation for ladies was vital: entertaining at Sanssouci was minimal during the reign of Frederick the Great, and it is known that women were never entertained there, so there were no facilities for them. Frederick had married Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Bevern in 1733, but separated from his wife after his accession to the throne in 1740. The Queen resided alone at Sch\u00f6nhausen Palace in Berlin after the separation, and Frederick preferred Sanssouci to be \"sans femmes\" (without women)."

        "content": "In the Baroque tradition, the principal rooms (including the bedrooms and toilets) are all on the piano nobile, which at Sanssouci was the ground floor by Frederick's choice. While the secondary wings have upper floors, the corps de logis occupied by the King occupies the full height of the structure. Comfort was also a priority in the layout of the rooms. The palace expresses contemporary French architectural theory in its apartement double ideals of courtly comfort, comprising two rows of rooms, one behind the other. The main rooms face the garden, looking southwards, while the servant's quarters in the row behind are on the north side of the building. An apartement double thus consists of a main room and a servant's chamber. Doors connect the apartments with each other. They are arranged as an \"enfilade\", so that the entire indoor length of the palace can be assessed at a glance. Frederick sketched his requirements for decoration and layout, and these sketches were interpreted by artists such as Johann August Nahl, the Hoppenhaupt brothers, the Spindler brothers and Johann Melchior Kambly, who all not only created works of art, but decorated the rooms in the Rococo style. While Frederick cared little about etiquette and fashion, he also wanted to be surrounded by beautiful objects and works of art. He arranged his private apartments according to his personal taste and needs, often ignoring the current trends and fashions. These \"self-compositions\" in Rococo art led to the term \"Frederician Rococo\". The principal entrance area, consisting of two halls, the \"Entrance Hall\" and the \"Marble Hall\", is at the centre, thus providing common rooms for the assembly of guests and the court, while the principal rooms flanking the Marble Hall become progressively more intimate and private, in the tradition of the Baroque concept of state rooms. Thus, the Marble Hall was the principal reception room beneath the central dome. Five guest rooms adjoined the Marble Hall to the west, while the King's apartments lay to the east - an audience room, music room, study, bedroom, library, and a long gallery on the north side. The palace is generally entered through the Entrance Hall, where the restrained form of the classical external colonnade was continued into the interior. The walls of the rectangular room were subdivided by ten pairs of Corinthian columns made of white stucco marble with gilded capitals. Three overdoor reliefs with themes from the myth of Bacchus reflected the vineyard theme created outside. Georg Franz Ebenhech was responsible for gilded stucco works. The strict classical elegance was relieved by a painted ceiling executed by the Swedish painter Johann Harper, depicting the goddess Flora with her acolytes, throwing flowers down from the sky. The white-and-gold oval Marmorsaal (\"Marble Hall\"), as the principal reception room, was the setting for celebrations in the palace, its dome crowned by a cupola. White Carrara marble was used for the paired columns, above which stucco putti dangle their feet from the cornice. The dome is white with gilded ornament, and the floor is of Italian marble intarsia inlaid in compartments radiating from a central trelliswork oval. Three arch-headed windows face the garden; opposite them, in two niches flanking the doorway, figures of Venus Urania, the goddess of free nature and life, and Apollo, the god of the arts, by the French sculptor Fran\u00e7ois Gaspard Adam, established the iconography of Sanssouci as a place where art was joined with nature. The adjoining room served as both an audience room and the Dining Room. It is decorated with paintings by French 18th-century artists, including Jean-Baptiste Pater, Jean Fran\u00e7ois de Troy, Pierre-Jacques Cazes, Louis Silvestre, and Antoine Watteau. However, here, as in the majority of the rooms, the carved putti, flowers and books on the overdoor reliefs were the work of Glume, and the ceiling paintings emphasise the rococo spirit of the palace. This exuberant form of ornamentation of rococo, Rocaille, was used in abundance on the walls and ceiling in the music room. Much of the work was by the sculptor and decorator Johann Michael Hoppenhaupt (the elder). A 1746 fortepiano by Gottfried Silbermann which once belonged to Frederick the Great remains as a nostalgic reminder of the room's original purpose. The King's study and bedroom, remodelled after Frederick's death by Frederick William von Erdmannsdorff in 1786, is now in direct contrast to the rococo rooms. Here, the clean and plain lines of classicism now rule. However, Frederick's desk and the armchair in which he died were returned to the room in the middle of the 19th century. Portraits and once missing pieces of furniture from Frederick's time have also since been replaced. The circular library deviated from the spatial structure of French palace architecture. The room is almost hidden, accessed through a narrow passageway from the bedroom, underlining its private character. Cedarwood was used to panel the walls and for the alcoved bookcases. The harmonious shades of brown augmented with rich gold-coloured Rocaille ornaments were intended to create a peaceful mood. The bookcases contained approximately 2,100 volumes of Greek and Roman writings and historiographies and also a collection of French literature of the 17th and 18th centuries with a heavy emphasis on the works of Voltaire. The books were bound in brown or red goat leather and richly gilded. The north facing gallery overlooked the forecourt. Here, again, Frederick deviated from French room design, which would have placed service rooms in this location. Recessed into the inner wall of this long room were niches containing marble sculptures of Greco-Roman deities. Five windows alternating with pier glasses on the outer wall reflect the paintings by Nicolas Lancret, Jean-Baptiste Pater and Antoine Watteau hung between the niches opposite. To the west were the guest rooms in which were lodged those friends of the King considered intimate enough to be invited to this most private of his palaces. Two of Frederick's visitors were sufficiently distinguished and frequent that the rooms they occupied were named after them. The Rothenburg room is named after the Count of Rothenburg, who inhabited his circular room until his death in 1751. This room balances the palace architecturally with the library. The Voltaire Room was frequently occupied by the philosopher during his stay in Potsdam between 1750 and 1753. The Voltaire Room was remarkable for its decoration, which gave it the alternative name of the \"Flower Room\". On a yellow lacquered wall panel were superimposed, colourful, richly adorned wood carvings. Apes, parrots, cranes, storks, fruits, flowers, garlands gave the room a cheerful and natural character.  designed the room between 1752 and 1753 from sketches made by Frederick."

        "content": "The panoramic vista of the garden of Sanssouci is the result of Frederick the Great's decision to create a terraced vineyard on the south slope of the hills of Bornstedt. The area had previously been wooded but the trees were felled during the reign of the \"soldier-king\" Frederick William I to allow the city of Potsdam to expand. On 10 August 1744, Frederick ordered the bare hillside to be transformed into terraced vineyards. Three wide terraces were created, with convex centres to maximise the sun light (see plan). On the partitions of the supporting walls, the brickwork is pierced by 168 glazed niches. Trellised vines from Portugal, Italy, France, and also from nearby Neuruppin, were planted against the brickwork, while figs grew in the niches. The individual parts of the terrace were further divided by strips of lawn, on which were planted yew trees. Low box hedging surrounded trellised fruit, making a circular ornamental parterre. In the middle of this \"wheel\", 120 steps (now 132) led downward further dividing the terraces into six. Below the hill, a Baroque ornamental garden, modelled on the parterre at Versailles, was constructed in 1745. The Great Fountain was built at the centre of this garden in 1748. Frederick never saw the fountain playing because the engineers employed in the construction had little understanding of the hydraulics involved. From 1750, marble statues were placed around the basin of the fountain. This again was a feature copied from Versailles: figures of Venus, Mercury, Apollo, Diana, Juno, Jupiter, Mars and Minerva, as well as allegorical portrayals of the four elements Fire, Water, Air and Earth. Venus and Mercury, the works of the sculptor Jean Baptiste Pigalle, and two groups of hunters, allegories of the elements (wind and water) by Lambert Sigisbert Adam, were presented by Versailles's owner, the French King Louis XV. The remaining figures came from the workshop of Fran\u00e7ois Gaspard Adam, a renowned sculptor in Berlin. By 1764, the French Rondel, as it came to be known, was completed. Nearby was a kitchen garden, which Frederick William I had laid out sometime prior to 1715. The Soldier King jokingly gave this simple garden the name \"My Marly\", in reference to the very similar garden at the summer residence of the Louis XIV in Marly-le-Roi. In his plans for the grounds, Frederick attached great importance on the combination of both an ornamental and a practical garden, thus demonstrating his belief that art and nature should be united."

        "content": "Following the terracing of the vineyard and the completion of the palace, Frederick turned his attention to the landscaping of the greater vicinity of the palace and thus began the creation of Sanssouci Park. In his organisation of the park, Frederick continued what he had begun in Neuruppin and Rheinsberg. A straight main avenue was laid out, ultimately 2.5\u00a0km long, beginning in the east at the 1748 obelisk and extended over the years to the New Palace, which marks its western end. Continuing the horticultural theme of the terraced gardens, 3,000 fruit trees were planted in the park, and greenhouses and nurseries laid out, producing oranges, melons, peaches and bananas. Statuary and obelisks were also erected, with representations of the goddesses Flora and Pomona. Frederick had several temples and follies erected in the same rococo style as the palace itself. Some were small houses which compensated for the lack of reception rooms in the palace itself. Frederick invested heavily in a vain attempt to introduce a fountain system in Sanssouci Park, attempting to emulate the other great Baroque gardens of Europe. Hydraulics at this stage were still in their infancy, and despite the building of pumping houses and reservoirs, the fountains at Sanssouci remained silent and still for the next 100 years. The invention of steam power solved the problems a century later, and thus the reservoir finally fulfilled its purpose. From around 1842, the Prussian Royal family were finally able to marvel at such features as the Great Fountain below the vineyard terraces, shooting jets of water to a height of 38\u00a0metres. The pumping station itself became another garden pavilion, disguised as a Turkish mosque, with its chimney becoming a minaret. The park was expanded under Frederick William III, and later under his son Frederick William IV. The architects Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Ludwig Persius built Charlottenhof Palace in the park on the site of a former farm house, and Peter Joseph Lenn\u00e9 was commissioned with the garden design. Broad meadows created visual avenues between Charlottenhof, the Roman Baths and the New Palace, and incorporated the follies such as the Temple of Friendship of Frederick the Great."

It eventually came under the protection of the Prussian \"Verwaltung der Staatlichen Schl\u00f6sser und G\u00e4rten\" (Administration of National Palaces and Gardens) on 1 April 1927. When air raids on Berlin began in the Second World War, the most notable works of art of the former imperial palaces were transferred for safety to Rheinsberg (Brandenburg) and Bernterode (near Worbis, Thuringia). The structure of the palace remained unscathed despite fierce fighting in the vicinity in 1945, but the ancient windmill, retained in the park by Frederick to add rustic charm, was destroyed. Following the end of the war, most of the items that had been moved to Rheinsberg were transferred as bounty to the Soviet Union; only a small fraction were returned to the palace in 1958. The artistic pieces from Bernterode found by American soldiers were first shipped to Wiesbaden to the \"Central Art Collecting Point\" and in 1957 went to Charlottenburg palace in West Berlin. Compared to many similar buildings, the palace fared well during almost 50 years under Communist jurisdiction in East Germany. The Church of St. Saviour in Sacrow and the centre of Potsdam were neglected, and some of the historic centre of Potsdam was demolished. The City Palace, Potsdam, containing architectural work by Knobelsdorff was demolished in 1960, but Sanssouci survived unscathed and the East German government endeavoured to have Sanssouci placed on the list of World Heritage Sites. This was achieved in 1990 with the following citation: The palace and park of Sanssouci, often described as the \"Prussian Versailles\", are a synthesis of the artistic movements of the 18th century in the cities and courts of Europe. That ensemble is a unique example of the architectural creations and landscape design against the backdrop of the intellectual background of monarchic ideas of the state. In 1991, following German reunification, Frederick's casket was interred in the terrace of the vineyard of Sanssouci \u2013 in the still existing crypt he had built there \u2013 after dark, without pomp, in accordance with his will. The library of Frederick was returned in 1992 to its former home at Sanssouci. Thirty-six oil paintings followed between 1993 and 1995. In 1995, the Foundation of Prussian Palaces and Gardens in Berlin-Brandenburg was formed. The organisation's job is to administer and care for Sanssouci and the other former royal palaces in Berlin and Brandenburg."

A masterpiece of the Early and High Middle Ages, Svetitskhoveli is recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. It is currently the second largest church building in Georgia, after the Holy Trinity Cathedral. Known as the burial site of the claimed Christ's mantle, Svetitskhoveli has long been one of the principal Georgian Orthodox churches and is among the most venerated places of worship in the region. Throughout the centuries, the cathedral served as the burial place for kings. The present cross-in-square structure was completed between 1010 and 1029 by the medieval Georgian architect Arsukisdze, although the site itself dates back to the early fourth century. The exterior archature of the cathedral is a well-preserved example of typical decorations of the 11th century. Svetitskhoveli is considered an endangered cultural landmark; it has survived a variety of adversities, and many of its priceless frescoes have been lost due to being whitewashed by the Russian Imperial authorities."

Saint Nino is said to have chosen the confluence of the Mtkvari (Kura) and Aragvi rivers as the place of the first Georgian church. According to Georgian hagiography, in the 1st century AD a Georgian Jew from Mtskheta named Elias was in Jerusalem when Jesus was crucified. Elias bought Jesus\u2019 robe from a Roman soldier at Golgotha and brought it back to Georgia. Returning to his native city, he was met by his sister Sidonia who, upon touching the Robe, immediately died from the emotions generated by the sacred object. The Robe could not be removed from her dead hands, so she was buried with it. The place where Sidonia is buried with the Robe is preserved in the Cathedral. Later, from her grave grew an enormous cedar tree. Ordering the cedar be chopped down to build the church, St. Nino had seven columns made from it for the foundation. The seventh column, however, had supernatural properties and rose by itself into the air. It returned to earth after St. Nino prayed the whole night. It was further said that from the seventh column flowed a sacred liquid that cured people of all diseases. In Georgian sveti means \"pillar\" and tskhoveli means \"life-giving\" or \"living\", hence the name of the cathedral. An icon portraying this event can be seen on the third column on the left-hand from the entrance. Reproduced widely throughout Georgia, it shows Sidonia's corpse at the root of a cedar tree stump, with an angel lifting the column towards heaven. Saint Nino is in the foreground: King Mirian and his wife, Queen Nana, are to the right and left. Georgia officially adopted Christianity as its state religion in 337."

The building has also been damaged by earthquakes. The present Svetitskhoveli Cathedral was built between 1010 and 1029 by the architect Arsukidze, at the invitation of the Catholicos Melchizedek I of Georgia. The king of Georgia at that time was Giorgi I (George I). A notable reconstruction was carried out at the end of 14th century after it was destroyed by Tamerlan. The next large renovation came in the beginning of 15th, when the current dome was built, being subsequently renovated again in the middle of 17th century. During the restoration of 1970-71 which was presided over by Vakhtang Tsintsadze, the base of the basilica built in the late 5th century by King Vakhtang Gorgasali after St. Nino's original church was found. During the early years of Georgian church building, the basilica was the dominant type of the Georgian church architecture before the crossed-dome style emerged. The cathedral is surrounded by a defensive wall, built of stone and brick during the reign of King Erekle II (Heraclius) in 1787. In the beginning of 1830s the cathedral was visited by the Russian Emperor. In connection with this, the portal galleries, surrounding the church from the north, west and south, which had been in unsatisfactory condition, were demolished. Archaeological expeditions in 1963 found the 11th century house of the Patriarch at the southern part of the wall.

        "content": "The cathedral is set on a flat lowland, amidst the old town of Mtskheta as its most significant construction, visible from nearly every spot. The base of the three-storey basilica, supposed to have been built by Vakhtang Gorgasali after St.Nino's original church, was found by archaeologists during the restoration of 1970-71. Its remnants can be seen in the western and southeastern parts, as well as under the pillars below the floor. The remnants of an even older wooden church were found inside in the southern arm of the cross. The architecture of the present Svetitskhoveli Cathedral, which dates from around 1020, is based on the cross-dome style of church architecture, which emerged in Georgia in the early Middle Ages and became the principal style after the political unification of Georgia by Bagrat III (978-1014). The characteristic of this style is that the dome is placed across all four sides of the church. There was originally a more harmonic three-step silhouette, with portals from the south, west and north. The northern and southern portals were demolished in the 1830s. The current entrance to the cathedral is from the west. The structure of the church is intended to ensure good acoustics. Large windows on the dome and walls give a significant amount of light. In its plan the church is a cross with shorter transverse and longer longitudinal arms. The east end has an apse. The dome of Svetitskhoveli was reconstructed several times over the centuries to keep the church in good condition. The current dome is from the 15th century with its upper part reconstructed in the 17th century, when it lost its original size and was reduced in height. The basic stone used for the Cathedral is a sandy yellow with trimmings, while around the apse window a red stone is used. The green stone used in the drum of the cupola is from the 17th century. The church facades are richly decorated. The curved blind arcading throughout is unaltered from the 11th century. The arches genuinely ascend or descend according to height of the corresponding part of the facade, creating an impression of constant movement. Two high and deep niches of the eastern facade are in clear contrast with surrounding illuminated walls. Each window is surrounded by ornamental stripe and stylised peacock tail-like decorations. Similar decorations are found in the upper parts of the eastern niches. A writing above the windows of eastern facade tell that the church was built by katolikos Melchisedek. Above it, two low-reliefs, an eagle with open wings and a lion under it, are set to the south from the three more recent accessory windows under the roof. A large window occupies most of the western top side of the church. The decoration shows the Ascension of Jesus, with Christ sitting on the throne and two angels at the both sides. This triangle-shaped decoration fits harmoniously with triangle of the cornice and an arch below it. The original sculpture on the wall has not survived, but was restored several times, most recently in the 19th century."

The walls are decorated with many Christian Orthodox icons,  most of which are not original (the originals being in the national museums of Georgia). The decoration of the church stonework also features carved grapes (as in many churches of Georgia), reflecting the country's ancient wine-making traditions. The large figure of Jesus at the altar was painted by Russian artist in the 19th century. The majority of the icons here date to the 20th century. Some are copies of older icons and frescoes from other churches throughout Georgia.

Built between the end of the 13th and the beginning the 14th centuries, it was erected here to mark Svetitskhoveli as the second most sacred place in the world (after the church of Jerusalem), thanks to Christ's robe. In front of this stone chapel, the most westerly structure aligned with the columns between the aisle and the nave marks Sidonia's grave. Remains of the original life-giving pillar are also here. It was built in the 17th century. Scenes of the lives of King Mirian and Queen Nana, and portraits of the first Christian Byzantine Emperor, Constantine I, and his mother Helena, were painted by G. Gulzhavarashvili at that time. Traces of the foundations of the 4th-century church have been found here."

S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt to mediate the crisis. Soon after, on October 2\u20133, 1933, it was the site of a bloody siege that would become known as the Battle of the Hotel Nacional of Cuba. The conflict pitted officers of the Cuban army, holed up in the hotel, who had been instrumental in the overthrow of Gerardo Machado but opposed Batista, against the non-commissioned officers and other ranks of the Cuban army, who supported Batista. Their successful assault on the hotel left over forty combatants dead and caused extensive damage to the building, including shell and bullet holes. The National Hotel was restored soon after and reopened. In 1939, it was renamed Hotel Nacional de Cuba. Chicago developer Arnold Kirkeby acquired the property in July 1943 and operated it for over a decade as part of his Kirkeby Hotels chain."

        "title": "Hotel Nacional de Cuba_Havana conference",
        "content": "Beginning on December 20, 1946 the hotel hosted the Havana Conference, an infamous mob summit run by Lucky Luciano and Meyer Lansky and attended by Santo Trafficante Jr., Frank Costello, Albert Anastasia, Vito Genovese and many others. Francis Ford Coppola dramatised the conference in his film The Godfather Part II. Delegates were present representing New York City, New Jersey, Buffalo, Chicago, New Orleans and Florida, with the largest delegation of bosses from the New York-New Jersey area. Several major bosses from the Jewish Syndicate were at the conference to discuss joint La Cosa Nostra-Jewish Syndicate business. According to conference rules, the Jewish delegates could not vote on Cosa Nostra rules or policies; however, the Jewish crime bosses were allowed input on any joint business ventures, such as the Flamingo Hotel. Luciano opened the Havana Conference by discussing a topic that would greatly affect his authority within the American Mafia; the position of \"capo di tutti capi\" or \"boss of all bosses\". The last official boss of all bosses had been Salvatore Maranzano, who was murdered in September 1931. By the end of 1931, Luciano had eliminated this top position and re-organized the Italian mafia into \"La Cosa Nostra\", or \"This Thing of Ours\". A board of directors, commonly called the \"Commission\", had been formed to oversee criminal activities, control rules, and set policies. La Cosa Nostra thus became the top criminal organization within the National Crime Syndicate. Now Luciano could easily have declared himself as Maranzano's heir in 1932; instead, Luciano decided to exercise control behind the scenes. This arrangement had worked until Vito Genovese's return from Italy. Officially, Genovese was now just a caporegime; however, he had made it clear that he intended to take control of the Luciano crime family. Since Luciano's deportation in 1946, Luciano ally Frank Costello had been the acting boss of the Luciano family. As a result, tensions between the Costello and Genovese factions had started to fester. Luciano had no intention of stepping down as family boss; he had to do something about Genovese. Luciano also realized that Genovese threatened his overall authority and influence within the American mafia, probably with support from other crime bosses. Therefore, Luciano decided to resurrect the boss of all bosses position and claim it for himself. He hoped the other bosses would support him, either by officially affirming the title or at least by acknowledging that he was still \"First Amongst Equals\". At the conference, Luciano allegedly presented the motion to retain his position as the top boss in La Cosa Nostra. Then Luciano ally, Albert \"The Mad Hatter\" Anastasia seconded the motion. Anastasia voted with Luciano because he felt threatened by Genovese's attempts to muscle in on his waterfront rackets. Checkmated by the Luciano-Costello-Anastasia alliance, Genovese was forced to swallow his ambitions and plan for the future. To further embarrass Genovese, Luciano encouraged Anastasia and Genovese to settle their differences and shake hands in front of the other bosses. This symbolic gesture was meant to prevent another bloody gang war such as the Castellammarese War of 1930\u20131931. With Luciano solidifying his personal position and squashing Genovese's ambition for now, Luciano brought up discussion of the mob's narcotics operations in the United States."

Alphons Landa, a prominent Washington attorney, represented Pan Am and arranged for other clients and friends to acquire shares in the hotel's ownership at the same time.  Dave Beck, President of the Teamsters and Roy Fruehauf of the Fruehauf Trailer Corporation were silent partners for at least 2 years. Fruehauf would sell his interest in the hotel in May 1957; other investors would lose everything when Castro came to power. Lansky planned to take a wing of the 10-storey hotel and create luxury suites for high-stakes gamblers. Batista endorsed Lansky's idea even though there were objections from American expatriates such as Ernest Hemingway. Under Lansky's impetus, a wing of the grand entrance hall was refurbished to include a bar, a restaurant, a showroom and a luxurious casino. It was operated by Lansky and his brother Jake, with Wilbur Clark as the front man. The new wing of the hotel, consisting of Wilbur Clark's Casino Internacional, the adjoining Starlight Terrace Bar, and the Casino Parisi\u00e9n night club (home of the Famous Dancing Waters), opened in 1956 with a performance by Eartha Kitt, who became the hotel's first black guest. The casino and clubs were an immediate success. According to an unpublished article sent to Cuban Information Archives around 1956\u201357, \"The bar was tended by local bartenders, and the casino managed by gentlemen from Las Vegas.\" By the spring of 1957 the casino, sublet by the hotel for a substantial rent to Lansky, was bringing in as much cash as the biggest casinos in Las Vegas. In late 1958 the casino was sold to Michael McLaney and Carroll Rosenbloom."

During the Cuban Missile Crisis, anti-aircraft guns were set up on the site of the Santa Clara Battery and an extensive series of tunnels were built under the property, which are now open to the public on guided tours. After years of neglect due to the reduction in tourism following the revolution, the hotel was mainly used to accommodate visiting diplomats and foreign government officials. The collapse of the USSR in 1991 forced the Cuban communist party, anxious for foreign exchange reserves, to reopen Cuba to tourists."

Jean-Paul Sartre stayed at the hotel just after the Revolution in 1960, with his wife, the philosopher, Simone de Beauvoir. The couple interviewed Che Guevara, and Sartre wrote 'Sartre visits Cuba', which was published in Havana in 1961, narrating his experiences. The hotel has since named the room he stayed in after him.

She was captured and sold by the Castilians as a slave in 1494. The 7-year-old Guanche girl from Taganana (in Santa Cruz de Tenerife) was taken captive along with four other youngsters (Cathayta, Inopona, Cherohisa and Ithaisa). Cathayta was sold as a slave with her companions in Valencia, in April 1494. It is believed that after this she spent the rest of her life somewhere in Spain as a Menina for some woman of the Spanish high society.

The site was purchased in 1790 by Braschi, supported by funds from  Pope Pius VI; Braschi demolished the 16th-century palace that Giuliano da Sangallo the Younger had built for Francesco Orsini in order to erect his own from the ground up. Construction was suspended in February 1798 during the Napoleonic occupation of the city, when the French temporarily took possession of it until 1802 and confiscated the recently acquired collection of antiquities it contained (though Braschi was reimbursed for them). In 1809, when Rome was declared an Imperial city by Napoleon, Duke Luigi moved into the palace and was declared mayor. On his death in 1816 the palace remained unfinished and the family funds depleted. In 1871 the Braschi Onesti heirs sold the building to the Italian State, who made it the seat of the Ministry of Interior (now moved into Palazzo del Viminale). During the Italian fascist period, it was used as the political headquarters of Benito Mussolini, and was adorned with a giant sculpture of the dictator's face. After the war, it housed 300 refugee families and many of the interior frescoes were seriously damaged by the fires they lit to keep warm. In 1949 the palace passed to the civic authorities and, following extensive conservation in 1952, the present installation of the museum was effected. The main entrance is on Via San Pantaleo (between Piazza Navona and Corso Vittorio Emanuele). The oval hall inside the main entrance overlooks Via San Pantaleo, and leads to the monumental staircase with its eighteen red granite columns which came from the gallery built by the Emperor Caligula on the banks of the River Tiber. Decorating the staircase there are ancient sculptures and fine stuccoes by Luigi Acquisti inspired by the myth of Achilles. On the piazza at the Southwest corner of the palace is the statue of Pasquino. The Neoclassical architect Giuseppe Valadier designed the chapel on the piano nobile or first floor. He also designed the white marble facade on the adjacent church of San Pantaleo for which is named the piazza in front of the Palazzo Braschi."

The house was modernised in 1879 with larger windows on the front of the house and annexes built on the east and north. At that time there was extensive grounds with good specimens of giant redwood (Sequoiadendron giganteum) and the largest hollies (Ilex aquifolium) in the neighbourhood.

The two-story Joseph F. Glidden House is constructed from locally fired brick, which is relatively soft. The softness of the brick has caused it to weather in a non-uniform fashion. The brick is said to have been fired at a small brickyard which once existed on the Kishwaukee River in DeKalb, near the present-day Lincoln Highway bridge. The home stands on a stone foundation and was designed by local carpenter and eventual barbed wire competitor to Glidden, Jacob Haish.

        "content": "The land where the Glidden House stands once held a log structure, which Glidden lived in when he first came to DeKalb at the beckoning of his cousin Russell Huntley. The house was built in 1861 for barbed wire entrepreneur Joseph Farwell Glidden. As his personal residence, the house, and its accompanying barn, were closely associated with his invention, really just an improvement, of barbed wire. Glidden's improvement upon a wire board fence developed by Henry Rose was of vast importance in the settlement of the United States west of the Mississippi. It was after Glidden saw Rose exhibit his wire at a fair in 1873 that he was struck with the idea of attaching barbs to wire strand fencing. Glidden is said to have experimented with some of his ideas in the basement kitchen of the Glidden House. He noticed that whenever he tried to attach barbs directly to strands of wire they slid along the length of the wire; Glidden realized he needed a way to crimp the barbs. He began tinkering around the home's kitchen. Glidden fit two hair pins to the shaft of a coffee mill, one centered and the other off-center. He found that by placing the wire between the pins and turning the crank a uniform barb resulted. How to crimp the barbs to the wire was solved, in the barn, by tying one end of the wire and another length of wire to a poplar tree on the grounds of the Glidden House and the other ends of the wires to a grindstone. The grindstone was used to twist the wires together and prevent the barbs from slipping. Day-to-day life at the Glidden House was mostly carried out in the home's basement which contained a full kitchen, dining room, and living room. The upper floors were used for guests and for sleeping quarters. In 1877 Glidden's daughter, Elva, married William H. Bush in the homestead. As of 2006 extensive restoration work had been completed on the home. The front porch was repaired and restored and inside, the hardwood floors have been replaced and refinished. In addition, the front parlors have been repainted and restored."

        "content": "The two-story brick structure is supported by a fieldstone foundation and still features its original front porch. The porch spans the length of the building's front (south) facade, at a height of about 6\u00a0feet (1.8\u00a0m). The porch is supported by four wooden pillars, which rest on stone bases. The stairs leading to the front porch are supported by two similar wooden posts, which, like the house, are set into fieldstone bases. The first step on the stairs was originally a limestone block embedded in the ground. The porch roof is supported by six wooden, bracketed pillars. The pillars are simple, with the brackets coming from the boxed capitals. At the rear of the porch wooden pilasters set at each end help to support the roof. Differentiating the home from the traditional French Colonial design is the porch roof, which is separate from the main roof. The house stands mostly as it did in 1861 save a few alterations. The front porch was screened in at the time the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places, the screens have since been removed. At the rear of the house a small porch was enclosed. In 1909 or 1910 there were major subtractions and replacements. Removed were a cast-iron widow's walk along the roof ridge and a large gable dormer, decorated in the same manner as the cornice decorating the roof trim. The present dormer replaced the larger one and is more of a low-shed type. The roof itself is a low gable and dominated by single stack, straddle ridge chimneys at its east and west ends. The boxed roof trim is a decorated cornice. The low-shed dormer is covered with green asphalt. The old widow's walk, which a neighbor dubbed Glidden's \"obscuratory\", was balustraded and set just above the dormer."

        "content": "The interior of the building is also similar to how it appeared when the house was constructed. However, a few changes have been made. In 1910 the two marble fireplaces were replaced by brick. The flooring has been replaced as needed. The home's basement, once the main living area, has since been converted several times for other uses. On the first floor of the home the rooms remain much the same as they were when Glidden lived in the house. An original multi-paneled wooden door remains at the entry from the porch to the central hall. The door, however, was altered, having glass panels installed to admit more light. The staircase is also original and its newel posts resemble those found in the Isaac and Harriet Ellwood House, another Haish designed home, and the Gurler House, whose architect is unknown though it was quite possibly Haish, both in DeKalb. On the house's east side are three rooms, whose original presence is open to debate. The three rooms are interconnected, another common French colonial element. The room adjacent the porch was used as the Glidden's dining room and is where the large brick fireplace, which replaced the marble one in 1909, is located. The 1909 fireplace is of the American Craftsman style. At the end of the hall, near the kitchen, there is a full bathroom. The western part of the first floor is dominated by a large formal living room. The room has two entrances, one at the front of the hall, near the front door and the other at the back end of the hall. This was the room in which Elva Glidden married in the late 19th century. After 1941 the rear part of the living room, or \"west\" room, was walled off and a second kitchen added. When Jessie Glidden, the last Glidden to occupy the old homestead, moved in 1998, the west room was restored to its original size and the second kitchen removed. The basement, and for part of the home's history, the main living area, is accessed via a staircase at the back of the first-floor hall. The steep stairs still show years of wear. One of the rooms off the main basement is the kitchen where Glidden is said to have experimented with the coffee grinder and his wife's hair pins, eventually leading to his brand of barbed wire. The second-floor served as the main sleeping quarters. It consists of a few simple bedrooms, all historically without closets. The upstairs hall contains a door which once accessed a staircase to the widow's walk, what remains of the space has been used as a closet for over a century."

However, in the late 1990s, the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency revealed that the nomination included only the house. The Glidden Historical Center initiated the process of adding the barn to the Register. Those moves were approved by the Illinois Historic Sites Advisory Council in 2002 and the barn officially became part of the National Register. The barn was built sometime around 1871, possibly even before, and is constructed of the same soft brick that makes up the exterior of the home. Tradition in the Glidden family holds that the barn, like the house itself, was designed and built by prominent local carpenter Jacob Haish. The famous barn, one of DeKalb County's oldest remaining, stands a full two-stories high, measuring around 50\u00a0feet (15\u00a0m) tall, with a width of 30\u00a0feet (9\u00a0m). In February 2007 the Glidden Homestead and Historical Center kicked off a fundraising drive. The drive is aimed at raising US$2 million to expand the Joseph F. Glidden House site to include museum space and a media center. Some of the funds will be used to help restore the barn and expand historical center museum space into the building."

It is of the three-bay, English tradition, the west bay containing a space for a stairwell leading to a hayloft and seven stalls. It is constructed of red brick and stands on a foundation of limestone. Glidden's barn took full advantage of the term vernacular; the brick was locally manufactured and the limestone locally quarried. The east bay of the barn contains an animal stall in its northeast corner and a fully enclosed office in its opposite corner. The second-floor hayloft is supported by the two massive transverse beams. The full-sized loft is accessible via an enclosed staircase against the south wall. The building's exterior roof is fully supported by the brick walls. The result is a loft which is an entirely open space save for some pole and beam construction supporting the laminated beams, which act as tie rods at the base of the roof. The barn roof is a common gable roof pitched at a 45\u00a0degree angle, it was originally covered with wooden shingles, those have been replaced over the years with asphalt. The barn features extensive windows, somewhat unusual outside of dairy barns, with a total of 14 eight-paned, double-hung windows dispersed over three sides of the rectangular structure, north, south and east. On the west side, facing the house, are seven smaller single-pane windows. The double-hung windows are topped with segmented arches constructed from a double row of bricks; the north and south main entrances are also topped with segmented brick arches, each of three rows of bricks."

According to legend, the founder was Duke Tassilo III of Bavaria in about 750, but it seems more likely that the founders were members of the powerful Bavarian noble family of the Huosi. Initially this was a Benedictine monastery, but later became a house of Augustinian canons. The abbey was dissolved during the secularization of 1803 and the buildings were mostly demolished between 1805 and 1807. The important late Gothic abbey church with early Baroque stucco work by the Wessobrunn stuccoist Georg Schmuzer is now the parish church. Part of what few buildings remained came into the possession of the Dominican sisters in 1892. The dispensary and the service block passed into private ownership. The unique library of Polling Abbey was restored in 1970-1975 and may be visited by arrangement with the Verein der Freunde des Pollinger Bibliotheksaals e.V.. A hospice is also accommodated in the remaining premises on the former abbey site."

Though the structure is listed on the National Register independently, it is included within the boundaries of the East Grove Street Historic District. The house is considered a contributing property to the historic district, which was added to the National Register in 1987. The historic significance of the home is in its association with Ruben M. Benjamin, who lived in it for more than 60 years until his death in 1917. Benjamin was raised in Chatham Center, Columbia County, New York. He graduated from Kinderhook Academy and then Amherst College and eventually attended Harvard law school for a year. He ended up in Bloomington in 1856. When Benjamin passed the bar exam in 1856, Abraham Lincoln served as his examiner. After passing the bar, Benjamin married and practiced law with various Bloomington lawyers, such as Asahel Gridley and Thomas F. Tipton. In 1869, Benjamin was elected to the Illinois state constitutional convention, where he distinguished himself as a leader. During the convention Benjamin strongly advocated language allowing the regulation of the freight industry. The clauses he supported were included in Article XI of the Illinois Constitution. Benjamin soon put the new constitution to the test when he undertook, perhaps, his biggest claim to fame. In 1872, he filed quo warranto proceedings against the Chicago and Alton Railroad, demanding their charter be revoked because they were charging rates which seemed unfair. The Chicago and Alton Railroad's rate structure charged US$5.65 to haul  of lumber from Chicago to Lexington but charged 65\u00a0cents less for a longer trip from Chicago to Bloomington. As a result, lower courts ruled that the state could regulate the rate structures of railroads, later the Supreme Court of the United States overturned the ruling on the grounds that some rate discrimination may prove justifiable. During the process of their decision, the Supreme Court made it clear that states did indeed have the right to regulate the rates of railroads and, by implication, the right to regulate other companies."

Two groups of architects - constructivists and neoclassicists - converged on the same transitional style, known as postconstructivism (or simply early Stalinism) and featuring classical shapes without classical detail; in which the architects stopped experimenting with shapes. However, they remained reluctant to accept classical order. Instead, they invented their own order, in which they combined large window surfaces with slim, capital-less supporting columns. School 518, for example, has such constructivist features as large glass panes and circular top floor windows. It also has a portico of slim white columns supporting the protruding third-floor hall, and is perfectly symmetrical. Technologically, it was built of man-made lime and cinder blocks, with wooden ceilings, partitions and roof trusses. With a gross volume of 18,500 cubic meters, it has nearly twice more volume per student than the 1935 standard (30.8 vs. 16.5 cubic meters per student)."

The Lake View Cemetery Association, which owned the cemetery, did not formally accept the new chapel until these plans were done.

A low gable roof covers the chapel and portico, and features a pediment with an unadorned tympanum in front. The entablature has an featureless frieze, although the cornice is carved with dentils. The exterior walls are clad in near-white Barre granite from Barre, Vermont. Jeptha Wade II wanted white terra cotta for the exterior, but this idea was abandoned when the architects pointed out that the surface of terra cotta could not be made completely smooth. The architects preferred white marble, both for its suitability for sculpture and because its white color more easily reflected the effects of light and shadow. The Norcross Marble Company of Cleveland and Tiffany & Co. both suggested using Georgia, Lee, Rutland, South Dover, and Tuckahoe marbles, but all of them had discoloration problems or chemical properties which led to discoloration, easy erosion, or pock-marking. Wade asked for a longer-lasting stone, and the architects chose granite. Because granite could not be carved in fine lines, the architects abandoned most of the decorative scheme they had proposed for the exterior and increased the size of the blocks used in the exterior walls. A variety of granites were considered, including Concord, Hallowell, North Jay, Troy, Westerly, and Barre. Once more, color and chemical issues led to the rejection of most types of granites. (Hallowell granite was acceptable, but rejected as too expensive.) The final choice came down to Troy and Barre. The granite used is known as \"light Barre\" and as \"standard Barre\". It is a biotite granite with a very light bluish-gray color. It is very even-grained, with the texture ranging from fine to medium. The granite came from the Standard Granite Quarries Co. quarry near Barre, Vermont, and was cut by Barclay Bros. Forty railroad cars were required to haul it to Cleveland. The order was so large and important to the Barre granite industry that quarry owner William Barclay traveled to Cleveland in late 1898 to consult with the architects. Three engaged columns of Barre granite are half-embedded in the side walls, while partially-embedded columns support each corner of the building. Two granite columns stand at the rear, and two on either side of the main entry door. The side and rear corner columns support  long granite cross beams, which in turn support the ceiling."

The wainscoting and ceiling are both made of white marble from Georgia. The chapel features a massive stained glass window at the rear and mosaics on each side wall. The stained glass window, titled Resurrection or Flight of the Soul, was designed by Tiffany artisan Agnes Northrop. It was exhibited at the Paris Exposition of 1900 before being installed at the chapel. Tiffany artist Frederick Wilson designed the wall mosaics, which were manufactured and installed by Tiffany & Co. Each mosaic is about  long. Known under various titles, including An Allegory of the Christian Religion and The Voyage of Life, the Favrile glass and gold tile mosaics depicted the passage of life to death.

Other elements of the chapel include a white Carrara marble lectern, white marble candlesticks atop the altar rail, and white mahogany pews. The sedilia, ceiling lamps, altar rail, candlesticks atop the altar rail, lectern, and casket pedestal are all made of white Carrara marble, often cut and carved with great delicacy and inlaid with colored glass, gold, and mother of pearl. Smaller clerestory windows of white frosted glass set in a heavy bronze grille are positioned above the chapel doors. The chapel also features a casket pedestal behind the altar rail, in place of an altar. This pedestal can be lowered mechanically through the floor into crypt, where the receiving vault is located."

Built in 1853, it was the first wood-frame house constructed in Rice County, Minnesota.  It was built by fur trader Alexander Faribault in the Greek Revival style.  Besides serving as a house, it also served as a civic center, polling place, and a church. The local address of the house is 12 First Avenue, Faribault, MN. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Alexander Faribault, son of Jean Baptiste Faribault, was a contemporary of Henry Hastings Sibley and served as his secretary for a time.  In 1835, Alexander Faribault set up a trading venture at the confluence of the Straight River and the Cannon River.  He had a relationship of mutual respect with the Dakota Indians with whom he traded, even to the degree of sheltering friendly Indians during the Dakota War of 1862.  In 1853, he built a large frame house.  His house reflected his prosperity, with nine bedrooms, a music room, a parlor, a sitting room, an office, a kitchen, a summer kitchen, and a sewing room.  Part of his wealth came from \"traders' claims\" stemming from the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux, but he was also the proprietor of a sawmill and a flour mill.  In turn, he was generous to the community, donating $3,000 to Bishop Henry Benjamin Whipple for the church and for Shattuck School.  He also donated land for the Seabury Divinity School.  He served as a delegate to the Minnesota Territorial Legislature and remained friends with Henry Mower Rice and Henry Hastings Sibley, even though Rice and Sibley were personal and political enemies."

From there he built a fortune in banking, ice and fur importing, canal and railroad building and telegraph and gas utilities. It was his wish to retire away from the city's hustle and bustle. Moss acquired a large parcel of land outside of Oakland's downtown, and he commissioned S. H. Williams on February 29, 1864, to design a two-story home on the property for US$14,500 plus building materials supplied by Moss. Williams, who referred to the design as a 'Gothic Cottage', contracted Joseph F. Heston to construct the building, but Heston defaulted on December 8, 1864. Moss finished the construction with his own builders guided by S. H. Williams. No records exist tallying the total cost of building the home. Moss, a longtime bachelor, married his housekeeper, Julia Theresa Wood, in 1867. They named the estate \"Mosswood\", a concatenation of their two surnames. Moss served as president of the Board of Trustees of the California State Asylum for the Deaf, Dumb and Blind. In 1868, Moss was elected Honorary Regent to the first Board of Regents of the University of California and was appointed regent in 1874 at which post he served until his death at Mosswood on November 21, 1880. Julia Wood Moss retained title to Mosswood after her husband's death. In the early 1890s, she supervised additions to the home. A single story study was constructed and modifications to the library were carried out. A large east-by-southeast-facing bay window dormer was added to the master bedroom over the drawing room. Mrs. Moss died childless in 1904 while vacationing in Europe."

        "content": "The tract of land that would become Mosswood Park was purchased by Moss from a Mr. Coffey in 1863. The home was built the following year. The Moss estate at that time was ; more than twice as large as modern-day Mosswood Park. Moss's property stretched from Telegraph Avenue to Glen Echo Creek and from Moss Avenue (now West MacArthur Boulevard) to 36th Street. Julia Wood Moss increased the size of her estate by purchasing a parcel of land from C. W. Hathaway after the death of her husband. The new strip of land extended the property past Glen Echo Creek to Broadway. After the death of Julia Wood Moss, the estate was subdivided: the northwestern section of the property was sold to developers who built single-family residential homes. The remaining  Mosswood plot (which contained the main house) went to probate court for public auction. Oakland mayor Frank Kanning Mott, an advocate of the City Beautiful movement, pushed to save as much of the parcel as possible for public greenspace. City attorney John McElroy bid against a developer's syndicate with a winning bid of $65,100 borrowed by Mott from a group of bankers; the city's coffers were devoid of funds for such a purchase. In 1907, Oakland voters approved a bond measure to buy the estate from Mott's bankers and turn it into a municipal park, thus preserving the main house. The bankers erected a wrought-iron fence around the parcel to keep vandals out while park improvements were being implemented. Final transfer of the property came in 1912 at a cost of over US$100,000. In the following decades, the park's grounds were augmented with the addition of an amphitheater and a decorative pergola adjoining Broadway. Tennis and basketball courts were laid and children's playgrounds were established. Many city-sponsored activities took place at the park. The wrought-iron fence surrounding Mosswood was taken down and donated to a scrap iron collection drive during World War II. For a brief few months in 1942, Oakland City Council renamed the park \"MacArthur Park\" in honor of General Douglas MacArthur, but the citizens of Oakland responded with roaring disapproval and the original name was reinstated. In 1945, Glen Echo Creek was undergrounded and landscaped over."

It is founded on plastered brick which surrounds the dirt floor basement and forms a pedestal to support the rest of the framing. Metal trim around the chimneys augments the wood shingle roof (\"best-quality of heart redwood\" shingles with clipped corners were originally specified.) Gable-ended dormers extend through the steep roofline; decorated barge-boards and heavily molded finials, corbels and string corners adorn the dormers and roof eaves. A strong sense of verticality is enhance by tall, narrow windows and the steeply-angled 52.5\u00b0 roof. The original main chimney vented flues from four fireplaces and rose in a slender pillar twelve feet above the roof at the symmetrical center of the building. Two other chimneys were of similar design. (By 1928, the tall, slender, cylindrical chimneys had been replaced by unremarkable short, rectangular brick ones.) Honduras mahogany was used for built-in interior cabinetry, Port Orford Cedar trimmed the lower floor walls with the balance of wall woodwork being clear redwood. The doors have Gothic trefoil and quatrefoil panels and are made of thick soft wood incised to simulate black walnut. The exterior redwood siding was painted in three coats of white lead and linseed oil; two of those coats were covered in \"clean white sand\" to provide texture and durability. Mirrored glass as well as plated, gilded and cast metal ornamental features were shipped around the Horn from France and England. Cast plaster rosettes, bosses and medallions detail the ceiling which otherwise is composed of geometric traceries of wood on smooth plaster. The main interior staircase is composed of three flights in a square 'U' shape and is finished in oak handrails supported by gothic arch balusters. Upper and lower flooring is  blind-nailed hard pine tongue and groove. Hard pine steps make up the stairs. The building holds approximately  of floor space. The upper story contains three major bedrooms with a shared bath; there are also three minor bedrooms. The ground story rooms include a parlor drawing room, a study, a library, an entry room leading into a spacious stair hall, a dining room, a kitchen and a pantry. It was originally piped for gas lighting; the gas manufactured on the premises. Gas chandeliers hung from cast plaster medallions. An elaborate fernery with water cascade was visible from the drawing room windows. Stained glass decorative elements add color to selected windows. A pair of stained glass window insets hold both the Moss and the Wood family coats of arms."

Lewis\" on October 7, 1786 and finished the payments on November 19, 1786. The Marshalls called a small wooden house their home while the building on the corner of Marshall and Ninth Streets was being built. The actual date the Marshalls moved into their house is sometimes stated as 1788 and other times stated as January 1791. When John Marshall built his house, Richmond's population was rapidly growing and many new homes were being built. The John Marshall House was one of the first homes to be built in the beginnings of a neighborhood which would later be known as the Court End of Richmond. The first insurance policy regarding this home, which is dated 1796, states that \"whole square, with the house as it is now except for the little wing, and a wooden office on Marshall Street, a wooden kitchen on Ninth, and the laundry\" were in John Marshall's ownership at that time. The insurance policy notes that the location of the previously mentioned buildings was lot 786 and that a stable was located at the extreme northwest corner of the square. Without deduction for decay, all the buildings on the property in 1796 were valued at $5500. Luckily for historians, John Marshall kept good records of his finances in his account book. In his account book, he recorded the names of everyone who worked on his home. Mr. Sydnor, Keeling and Smith, W. Goode, W. Duke, and W. B. Lewis are listed as working on the house, with the last payment for work on the home in November 1790. According to Marshall's account books, the total cost of the house was 1211 pounds, 1 shilling, and three pence. Though Marshall's account book shows the last payment for work on the house being in November 1790, construction of fences and outbuildings was still in progress during July 1791. Sometime before the insurance policy was updated in 1810, the John Marshall House expanded with a new wing and three porches, which were not included in the 1796 insurance policy."

Misses Anne and Emily Harvie sold the lot in 1907 to the City of Richmond, who planned to destroy the house and build John Marshall High School on the site. Women's organizations were able to successfully unite to preserve the John Marshall House. In 1911, the house was placed into the perpetual care of Preservation Virginia (formerly known as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities) who has operated it as a historic house museum ever since. The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960. In 2005, in honor of the 250th anniversary of John Marshall's birth and in recognition of more than 80 years of stewardship responsibility, the house was deeded to Preservation Virginia by the City of Richmond. Since then the house has undergone major restoration work including a new roof, repainting to the original color scheme, and other physical and mechanical upgrades. The John Marshall House is open seasonally for drop-in tours and throughout the year by appointment and for special events."

The building is a two-story rectangular wood-frame structure, set on a granite foundation, with a gable roof.  The roof ridge runs parallel to River Road, which lies to the north, and the main gable-end facade faces roughly east.  The walls are finished with painted wooden shingles, with broad paneled pilasters rising at the corners to an entablature that encircles the building below the roof line.  The main facade is symmetrically arranged, with two entrances each flanked by pilasters and topped by an entablature.  Above each entrance at the second level is a sash window.  The gable end is fully pedimented, with a small lancet-shaped window at the center. The interior of the building has a single large space, with a balcony gallery on three sides (excepting the west end).  The original box pews were removed from the main floor, probably before 1900, with congregants apparently using folding chairs; box pews remain in the gallery.  A 19th-century pressed metal ceiling obscures the original domed ceiling.  The building now houses museum displays. The Universalist congregation of Orleans took form as early as 1832, when a number of congregants left the local Congregational Church over their theological differences.  The new congregation was formally organized in 1833, and its new meetinghouse was built by David Taylor, Jr. on land donated by David Taylor, Sr., a former ship's captain and the local postmaster.  The building was enlarged sometime in the 19th century by the addition of about  to the west end; this probably took place between the 1840s and 1860s, when the congregation was at its largest. Faced with declining participation, the Universalists and Congregationalists reunited their congregations in 1939, holding services in the Congregational church and using this meetinghouse as a Sunday school.  The building was sold to the Orleans Historical Society in 1971."

The building consists of a north-facing original rectangular two-story block, behind which a series of symmetrically-arranged wings have been built.  The original block, designed by the renowned architect Alexander Parris, measures , and is fashioned out of large blocks of Quincy granite.  It is fronted by a Greek temple front, consisting of a triangular pediment supported by four fluted Doric columns.  The temple front, including the columns, is fashioned out of wood finished to give the appearance of stone.  The main courtroom has retained most of its original woodwork and trim, including some of its original furnishings. The building has been repeatedly enlarged to meet increased need for facilities.  All of these expansions continued the use of Quincy granite, giving the building a unified feel.  In 1879 the building was enlarged to the rear, and in 1889 a single-story ell was added extending east from the rear.  In 1906 the eastern ell was raised to two stories and a matching two-story ell was added to the west.  These ells were extended further to the southwest and southeast with two-story additions in 1925.  The building underwent a major rehabilitation in 1971, at which time a small addition was added to south, centered between the last two additions."

When built, the Los Altos Apartments began as a co-op and were later used as a luxury apartment and hotel catering to stars like Clara Bow, Bette Davis, Mae West, Douglas Fairbanks, Ava Gardner, Judy Garland, and William Randolph Hearst. Hearst had a custom suite designed for his mistress Marion Davies in the Los Altos, which has been restored and named The Hearst Suite. The Spanish Colonial-style building went bankrupt during the Great Depression and fell into disrepair. In 1993, a local housing group Neighborhood Effort rescued the structure from demolition and obtained national historic site status by tracking down its original parts and design details such as floor tiles, doorknobs, and colors. In the 1980s the building became a magnet for a bohemian list of residents. Jeff Ayeroff, who went on to co-found Virgin Records America and the Work Group, lived in the building as did screenwriter Becky Johnston while she wrote the scripts \"Under the Cherry Moon\" for Prince and \"The Prince of Tides\" for Barbra Streisand.  Artists Nancy Reese, Phil Garner, Eric Blum and Tom Shannon all rented living quarters and art dealers Tom Jancar and  Richard Kuhlenschmidt opened the Jancar Kuhlenschmidt Gallery in the basement of the building. New York hotshots Richard Prince and Louise Lawler had their first L.A. exhibitions there. Actor Frederic Forrest was living at the Los Altos when he turned in his critically acclaimed performance in Francis Ford Coppola's 1988 film Tucker: The Man and His Dream, as did musician Tommy Gear, who was a founding member of revered L.A. punk group The Screamers. Los Angeles-based architectural firm M2A rehabilitated the 75-unit structure, and restored its original decor. The firm restored or recreated Los Altos' original light fixtures, hardware, carpets, plaster work, awnings, and ornamental iron work. The rehabilitation \"successfully transformed the property from a vacant, blighted, graffiti-infested building into a healthy, mixed-income building serving the very low income population as well as the market population.\" Today, Los Altos is the home to artists, screenwriters, and actors. In 1999, Los Altos received several preservation design awards from the California Preservation Foundation and the Los Angeles Conservancy. The landmark also received a Historic Preservation Award of Excellence from the city of Los Angeles."

The present cathedral building, which is located in the Piazza Duomo, was constructed as a simple parish church between 1597 and 1618 that was greatly enlarged a few years later when it received the relics of Saint Venera, one of the two patron saints of the city,. The structure survived the earthquake of 1693, and the present cathedral is a 17th-century building with significant additions from each succeeding century. Of particular note are the Baroque portal representing the Annunciation by Placido Blandamonte of Messina, dating from 1668, combined with a Neo-Gothic west front by Giovan Battista Filippo Basile, completed after his death in 1891 to his plans, of c.1900. The two campaniles, in Mannerist style with octagonal bases, although identical in appearance, are centuries apart in construction: the one to the south is from 1655, as is the cupola, while the one to the north, as well as the rose window, are from 1890.

He travelled via covered wagon and settled on Cache Creek in 1850, where he built a modest home. In October 1850 he went to Scott Bar to mine gold, but found little success. He returned to Yolo County in 1851 and bought a plot of 160 acres four and a half miles north east of Woodland, where he grew grain and raised livestock. He sold this property in 1857, and purchased 320 acres of land adjoining the southern part of Woodland, CA. He built a small 16' by 20' structure on this land, which, later became the center for his 3,000 acre estate. He specialized in raising high-grade cattle, like Shorthorn Durhams. Near Christmas of 1857, William married Mary Isabel Cook (d.1915) of Kentucky. Mary was no stranger to living on farming estates. The Cook family emigrated to California in 1853 and established their own successful farm in Yolo County. William and Mary had three sons: Robert (1859-1941), Thomas (b.1861), and Joseph (1863-1897). William and Mary lived in the estate's main property until their deaths in 1906 and 1915. Before his death, William handed management of the estate over to his eldest son, Robert. Robert Gibson earned a business degree from Heald's Business College in San Francisco, California, and continued operating the estate's grain and livestock cultivation following his father's death.  He and his wife Elnora (born Elnora Root) lived on the property until their deaths in 1941 and 1963. The second child, Thomas Gibson, also remained in Woodland. He opened a successful hardware store while also promoting the Woodland Creamery Company. Thomas remained a prominent figure in Woodland throughout his life. He served on several boards concerning local politics, education, businesses, and agriculture. He was also a member of the Native Sons of the Golden West. Not much is known about the youngest son, Joseph, who died at the age of 34 in 1897."

William used his increasing wealth from a successful agricultural business to enlarge the house. He made several extensions between the 1870s and the 1900s, adopting architectural styles popular during each period. The first extension, completed in 1877, included adding two large parlors on the first floor, and a second story with four bedrooms. By 1891, the Gibson estate had grown from the initial 320 acres to 2,400 acres. The farmhouse was surrounded by many outbuildings to help make the operation self-sustaining. Along with a kitchen, pantry and dining room addition to the main house, a root cellar, cook's house, tan house for water storage, workshop, smokehouse, and a bunk house for hired workers were added to the property. The house entered a state of stasis between 1900 and 1963, with no major extensions or alterations. Meanwhile, the surrounding estate was sold for residential, commercial and agricultural development. Following Elnora Gibson's death in 1963, the home and acreage was uncared for and dilapidated. Some labeled it a haunted house during this vacancy. In 1975, efforts to purchase the house and the 2.5 acres it resides on were directed by the County of Yolo to establish it as a county park and the first countywide historical museum. Yolo County Historical Museum Corporation was incorporated in 1986, and their board of directors operated the museum on behalf of the county. In 2018 the Yolo County Board of Supervisors transferred stewardship of the house and grounds to YoloArts, the County arts organization, to change the usage of the property. The main house remains a museum, open to the public on weekdays. Two of the barns were transformed, one into a gallery space and another adapted with temperature control for archival and collection storage."

        "content": "The Gibson house reflects multiple architectural styles. The oldest part of the present structure was a rectangular 16' by 20' wooden building. It is unknown how many stories it had, and whether it displayed any significant features associated with a particular architectural style. In 1872, William Gibson added a 31' by 37' brick structure north of the building, consisting of two stories with porches and balconies on the north and west sides. He next added a smaller two-story brick building to the south end of the old wooden structure, approximately 17' by 35' large. These extended several feet off each side of the old building. Gibson built around the original building instead of demolishing and rebuilding on the same plot. He incorporated the initial house into the additions. It is visible today only upon a structural inspection, mainly seen in the difference in wall thickness. The initial building's exterior walls, which were thicker than the interior walls, are visible in the doorways between the dining room and kitchen. The 1976 National Register of Historic Places assessment identified the style of the main brick structure as modified Georgian revival due to its massing, hipped roof, and floor plan consisting of a central hallway with two rooms off to each side, each having a fireplace on the outside wall, and four bedrooms upstairs. However, Georgian style was popular in California around 1830, which is far outside of the Gibson House's construction period. A more appropriate style would be Italianate, which was popular from 1840 to 1885 and fits the house's style and construction period."

The movement responded to the formal classical ideals in art and architecture that had been fashionable for the last 200 years. It emphasized the features seen in informal Italian farmhouses, such as their square towers. In the United States the style took on regional characteristics. In general, the style can be identified by multiple stories, a low-pitched hipped roof, and often a polygonal or square cupola placed on the roof. Other Italianate features visible on the present property include the balustraded balcony, tall double-hung windows with hood moulds, and the paneled front door with a decorative entablature and pilasters. The original square cupola was removed during the Neoclassical remodel, done between 1890 and 1900."

The planners emphasized a classical theme, and the central court consisted of colonnaded buildings designed by some of the periods best known architects. The fair was widely attended and documented, with photos of the exhibits shared throughout the country. The monumental sized buildings influenced the construction of commercial and residential classical buildings. Some of the identifying features include full height porches supported by classical columns (with Ionic or Corinthian capitals), and a symmetrically balanced windows and central door. The Gibson House's most dominant Neoclassical features are the four columns on the northern fa\u00e7ade. The columns have Ionic capitals, identified by the volutes. An oak leaf motif was added to the capital, likely for the surrounding oak trees that still stand on the property today. With the addition of the columnated porch, the house lost its hipped pyramid roof, at present it now has a front gable with patterned wood shingles. The original hipped shape is still visible in the attic space, suggesting the original roof was not removed during the reconstruction but instead covered. The Neoclassical additions were the last major alterations done to the house."

It was named for Lot Kapu\u0101iwa, who had reigned as Kamehameha V, and its architect, George Lucas, employed an Italianate Renaissance revival style that matched that of the other Hawaiian Monarchy buildings of that period. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 2 July 1973. Built of rusticated concrete blocks, it is two stories high, with a flat roof and a recessed central entrance on the Queen Street side. The arched windows have keystones on the ground floor and dripstones on the upper level, and the roofline is decorated with a cornice and balustrade. In 1930, a new wing and entry corridor were added and the interior was renovated. The interior is currently undergoing further renovations."

It was originally conceived as a branch of the Leazes Park Synagogue for families who had moved out of the city centre, but eventually founded in 1914 as an independent congregation. The synagogue, on Eskdale Terrace in Jesmond, was built in 1914\u201315 by Marcus Kenneth Glass in an Art Deco interpretation of Byzantine Revival style. The porch has a triple arcade and columns with lotus bud capitals.  A large, sunburst, stained-glass window fills the huge Byzantine arch of the facade.  The brickwork is coursed with alternating beige and red stripes. The synagogue was closed in 1986. The exterior has been carefully conserved; the interior was gutted and renovated for use as a school.  It formed part of the Newcastle High School for Girls until 2016, when approval was granted for its conversion into flats. A commemorative plaque marking the building's previous use as a synagogue was unveiled in July 2019."

In the early decades of the 20th century, the area attracted a number of Hartford's elites to also build houses in the same area.  There are 87 examples of Georgian Revival architecture and 55 examples of Tudor Revival architecture in the district. A few homes are designed in the French Norman Chateau style, and the Craftsman and Prairie Style are each represented by a single building. The Connecticut Governor's Residence is included in the district as a contributing building.  It is located at 990 Prospect Avenue, and is a Georgian Revival, built in 1908.  It was designed by Andrews, Jacques and Rantoul, of Boston, and was altered in 1916 (see photo #7 in accompanying photos)."

        "content": "The Coventry Glass Factory Historic District is a  historic district in Coventry, Connecticut that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.  The listing encompasses ten historically significant houses, clustered near the site of the former Coventry Glass Factory, in a linear district along what was the Boston Turnpike, now U.S. Route 44.  The Skungamaug River is a creek cutting through the district.  The glassworks operated here between 1813 and about 1845, and most of these houses date to that time, exhibiting largely vernacular Federal and Greek Revival styles.  The most sophisticated and best-preserved house is that of Nathaniel Root, at 1044 Boston Turnpike.  The ground in the area of the glassworks (of which no structures survive) is littered with melted glass fragments and burnt brick fragments. The Coventry Glassworks was established in 1813, in part to meet demand for glass objects that had previously been fulfilled by English companies, a source cut off by the War of 1812.  The glassworks founders included experienced glassblowers and local businessmen, who combined their capital and expertise.  The company produced small bottles, inkstands, and flasks, and is credited with creating the first \"portrait flask\", bearing a depiction of the Marquis de Lafayette in commemoration of his 1825 visit to the United States.  The company had a rotating cast of partners and glassblowers, and remained in operation until about 1845, when its proprietors at that time moved the business to Willington.  Most of the houses in this area were built by or for either the proprietors, or the workers they hired."

        "content": "The Isabella Ranger Station is a complex of 21 buildings in Stony River Township, Minnesota, United States, near the town of Isabella.  It is located on Minnesota State Highway 1 about one mile east of Isabella.  The complex is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its association with New Deal federal relief construction. Of the 21 buildings, 11 are listed as contributing properties to the district.  These were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s and were built of horizontally-laid wood logs, mostly aspen and pine.  These buildings consist of dwellings, an office building, storage facilities, and warehouses.  Some other buildings on the site were constructed after the CCC built the original complex, and are not considered contributing properties. The ranger station is nationally significant for its use as an administration center that supported multiple federal land management functions within the Isabella Ranger District of the Superior National Forest.  The rustic architecture is also significant because it was common to the design of land management administrative buildings within this time period.  The historic context of the Superior National Forest began with a recommendation by General C.C. Andrews that all of the public land within Cook County, Minnesota and Lake County, Minnesota, totaling around , should be preserved as a forest reserve.  On February 13, 1909, President Theodore Roosevelt established the Superior National Forest with an area of .  Additional proclamations raised the size of the forest to .  During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps was formed to provide relief for unemployment, and also to stimulate local economies through federally funded, grassroots development projects.  The Isabella guard station served as a facility for crews that were working in an often roadless area within the Superior National Forest.  While crews and their assignments changed frequently, CCC Company 701, based in Ely, Minnesota, and Company 3703, based in Baptism River, Minnesota were confirmed to be involved in the construction of this station. Other surviving guard stations include the East Bearskin Lake Guard Station, near Gunflint; Crooked Lake Guard Station, near LaCroix; Halfway/North Central Experiment Station; Kekekabic Lake Guard Station; Lac LaCroix Guard Station; Sawbill Lake Guard Station; South Kawishiwi River Pavilion; and Tofte Ranger Station."

The Luma co-operative was a response to the controlling influence on light bulb manufacturing by the Phoebus cartel. The architecture has a similar style to the Swedish Co-operative Union's own Luma factory in Stockholm built in 1930 designed by their in-house architects. Its distinctive feature is the protruding tower (resembling an airport control tower) which was originally used to test light bulbs beyond their design voltage for longevity.  The light emitted from the testing tower lit up the surrounding area at night. During WWII testing was not allowed during the blackout and the Royal Observer Corps used it as a lookout post. The building was part of the massive Shieldhall Manufacturing Complex that used to stand in the area, and its completion was also intended as a symbol of the Empire Exhibition of that year which was held in nearby Bellahouston Park. Following the ending of light bulb manufacture at the plant the building was sold and, amongst other uses, was used as a caravan showroom before finally falling into dereliction in the 1980s. In 1993, a local housing association acquired the decaying building amid fears it would be demolished, and began the process of it restoring it and converted it into affordable housing.  In the end, forty-three new apartments were created, with a further twelve in a creative reproduction of the original building's style to the rear.  The tower element is now illuminated with blue neon lighting and is a noticeable landmark around Govan, and it can be clearly seen from the westbound carriageway of the M8 motorway between Junctions 24 and 25."

It is a typical example of the \"Strawberry Hill Gothic\" style of architecture, and it prefigured the nineteenth-century Gothic Revival. Walpole rebuilt the existing house in stages starting in 1749, 1760, 1772 and 1776. These added Gothic features such as towers and battlements outside and elaborate decoration inside to create \"gloomth\" to suit Walpole's collection of antiquarian objects, contrasting with the more cheerful or \"riant\" garden. The interior included a Robert Adam fireplace; parts of the exterior were designed by James Essex. The garden contained a large seat shaped like a Rococo sea shell, which was recreated in the 2012 restoration of the garden, one of the many examples of historic garden conservation in the UK."

        "content": "In May 1747, Horace Walpole took a lease on a small 17th-century house that was \"little more than a cottage\", with  of land from a Mrs. Chenevix. Horace was under familial and political pressure to establish a country seat, especially a family castle, which was a fashionable practice during the period. The following year he purchased the house which the original owner, a coachman, had named \"Chopped Straw Hall\". This was intolerable to Walpole, \"his residence ought, he thought, to possess some distinctive appellation; of a very different character...\" Finding an old lease that described his land as \"Strawberry Hill Shot\", Walpole adopted this new name for his soon to be \"elegant villa\". In stages, Walpole rebuilt the house to his own specifications, giving it a Gothic style and expanding the property to  over the years. As Rosemary Hill notes, \"Strawberry Hill was the first house without any existing medieval fabric to be [re]built from scratch in the Gothic style and the first to be based on actual historic examples, rather than an extrapolation of the Gothic vocabulary first developed by William Kent. As such it has a claim to be the starting point of the Gothic Revival.\" Walpole and two friends, including the connoisseur and amateur architect, John Chute (1701\u20131776), and draughtsman and designer, Richard Bentley (1708\u20131782), called themselves a \"Committee of Taste\" or \"Strawberry Committee\" which would modify the architecture of the building. Bentley left the group abruptly after an argument in 1761. Chute had an \"eclectic but rather dry style\" and was in charge of designing most of the exterior of the house and some of the interior. To Walpole, he was an \"oracle of taste\". Walpole often disagreed with Bentley on some of his wayward schemes, but admired his talent for illustration."

        "content": "William Robinson of the Royal Office of Works contributed professional experience in overseeing construction. They looked at many examples of architecture in England and in other countries, adapting such works as the chapel at Westminster Abbey built by Henry VII for inspiration for the fan vaulting of the gallery, without any pretence at scholarship. Chimney-pieces were improvised from engravings of tombs at Westminster and Canterbury and Gothic stone fretwork blind details were reproduced by painted wallpapers, while in the Round Tower added in 1771, the chimney-piece was based on the tomb of Edward the Confessor \"improved by Mr. Adam\". He incorporated many of the exterior details of cathedrals into the interior of the house. Externally there seemed to be two predominant styles 'mixed'; a style based on castles with turrets and battlements, and a style based on Gothic cathedrals with arched windows and stained glass. The building evolved similarly to how a medieval cathedral often evolved over time, with no fixed plan from the beginning. Indeed, Michael Snodin argues, \"the most striking external feature of Strawberry Hill was its irregular plan and broken picturesque silhouette\". Walpole added new features over a thirty-year period, as he saw fit. The first stage to make, in Walpole's words, a 'little Gothic castle' began in 1749 and was complete by 1753, a second stage began in 1760, and there were other modifications such as work on the great north bedchamber in 1772, and the \"Beauclerk Tower\" of the third phase of alterations, completed to designs of a professional architect, James Essex, in 1776. The total cost came to about \u00a320,720. Walpole's 'little Gothic castle' has significance as one of the most influential individual buildings of such Rococo \"Gothick\" architecture which prefigured the later developments of the nineteenth century Gothic revival, and for increasing the use of Gothic designs for houses. This style has variously been described as Georgian Gothic, Strawberry Hill Gothic, or Georgian Rococo."

The house is described by Walpole as \"the scene that inspired, the author of The Castle of Otranto\", though Michael Snodin has observed: \"it is an interesting comment on 18th-century sensibility that the melancholy interiors of The Castle of Otranto were suggested by the light, elegant, even whimsical rooms at Strawberry Hill\". The interiors of Walpole's \"little play-thing house\" were intended to be \"settings of Gothic 'gloomth' for Walpole's collection\". His collection of curious, singular, antiquarian objects was well publicized; Walpole himself published two editions of A Description of the Villa of Mr. Horace Walpole at Strawberry Hill to make the \"world aware of the extent of his collection\". Speaking on Walpole's collection, Clive Wainwright states that Walpole's collection \"constituted an essential part of the interiors of his house\". The character of the rooms at Strawberry Hill was \"created and dictated\" by Walpole's taste for antiquarianism. Though even without the collection present, the house \"retains a fairy-tale quality\". Horace Walpole's Strawberry Hill Collection of several thousand items can still be viewed today. The Lewis Walpole Library of Yale University now has a database which \"encompasses the entire range of art and artifacts from Walpole's collections, including all items whose location is currently known and those as yet untraced but known through a variety of historical records\"."

        "content": "Walpole was as meticulous in designing and developing his gardens as he was improving his house, though \"his ignorance of horticulture at first embarrassed him a little\". Improvements on the grounds were started even before work on the house. In an essay titled \"On Modern Gardening\", Walpole expresses his own ideas as reflected in his Strawberry Hill grounds. Walpole's taste in landscape and gardening moved away from the traditional, formal layout of \"parterre, terraces, marble urns, statued fountains and \u2018canals measured by the line'\". The French or Italian taste seemed, to Walpole, alien to the English climate \"resulting in symmetrical and unnatural gardens\". Trees and shrubs were planted in \"natural groupings\" on the lawn. Walpole preferred to see all nature as a garden. He did not however appreciate the extravagant \"romantic grotto and that favorite eighteenth-century conceit, the hermitage\". From \"On Modern Gardening\": \"the fairest scenes, that depend on themselves alone, weary when often seen. The Doric portico, the Palladian bridge, the Gothic ruin, the Chinese pagoda, that surprise the stranger, soon lose their charms to their surfeited master. But the ornament whose merit soonest fades, is the hermitage, or scene adapted to contemplation. It is almost comic to set aside a quarter of one's garden to be melancholy in.\" Here, Walpole's separation of style between his house and grounds can be seen. A friend, Horace Mann, assumed that Walpole's garden would be similarly Gothic. Walpole responded; \"Gothic is merely architecture, and as one has a satisfaction in imprinting the gloomth of abbeys and cathedrals on one's house, so one's garden, on the contrary, is to be nothing but riant, and the gaiety of nature\". Walpole saw the modern English garden as a point of perfection: \"we have given the true model of gardening to the world; let other countries mimic or corrupt our taste; but let it reign here on its verdant throne, original by its elegant simplicity, and proud of no other art than that of softening nature's harshness and copying her graceful touch\". He was a follower of William Kent, one of the originators of the English landscape garden. The gardens are Grade II* listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens."

These visitors became an incessant addition to Strawberry Hill, and as delighted as Walpole was to share his vision, they became a bit of a nuisance to him. While Walpole gave tours to the more important visitors, he shrank from less dignified attention and \"retreated to his cottage in the flower garden\" while his housekeeper gave tours to the public. In a letter to George Montagu in 1763, Walpole complained: \"I have but a minute's time in answering your letter, my house is full of people, and has been so from the instant I breakfasted, and more are coming- in short, I keep an inn; the sign, the Gothic Castle...my whole time is passed in giving tickets for seeing it, and hiding myself when it is seen- take my advice, never build a charming house for yourself between London and Hampton-court, everybody will live in it but you.\" Warburton notes that while Walpole may have been annoyed from time to time, he also came to see his estate contributing to the public's enjoyment when he had doubts about his endeavour. \"He arrives at the conclusion that all he has done is for the benefit of others rather than for himself\"."

Other objects suggest a gothic sensibility, such as the clock which Henry VIII gave to his second wife Anne Boleyn, who was later beheaded; the critic Jonathan Jones of The Guardian calls this \"truly spooky\", like the 500-year-old red cardinal's hat that Walpole believed, most probably correctly, belonged to Cardinal Wolsey.

Houses built or refronted supposedly in the style include: Braziers Park, a South Oxfordshire country house built by Daniel Harris in 1688, re-fronted in the Gothic style in 1799; Lindfield argues that it was influenced more by \"very Gothic Oxford\" where Harris lived and worked, than by Strawberry Hill House. Donnington Park, Berkshire, a house designed by John Chute in 1763. Houghton Lodge, a fishing lodge in Hampshire, built around 1800 in the Cottage orn\u00e9 style, influenced by Strawberry Hill. Lee Priory, Kent, by James Wyatt 1780-1790, destroyed in the 1950s. Priory Hospital in Roehampton, which was built in the Strawberry Hill Gothic style in 1811."

Founded in 1837 and originally known as The Dicker Chapel, the \"large and impressive\" Classical/Georgian-style building stands back from a main road in a rural part of East Sussex.  The 800-capacity building included a schoolroom and stables when built, and various links exist between people and pastors associated with the chapel and other Strict Baptist and Calvinistic causes in the county, which is \"particularly well endowed with [such] chapels\". The chapel was built in 1837\u201338 and substantially extended in 1874.  It has its own burial ground, extended in 1880.  After a brief attempt by the first pastor to run the chapel along mixed denominational lines\u2014serving Strict Baptist and Calvinistic Independent worshippers\u2014it assumed a solely Strict Baptist identity, which it retains as of .

        "content": "The name Dicker originally described a large area of land near the River Cuckmere and South Downs, several miles inland from the English Channel.  No reference to Dicker was made in the Domesday Book of 1086, and much of the area was unenclosed common land.  It was crossed by a highway (the present A22), south of which was a major religious house, Michelham Priory.  This gradually declined and was abandoned at the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536.  The scattered settlements at Lower Dicker and Upper Dicker developed slowly and only gained their present names in the 18th century. Lower Dicker is now a linear settlement along the A22, but in the early 19th century little existed at the \"lower end of the Diccar ... in Hellingly Parish\" other than a brickworks.  There were a few farms on the common land, though, and many of their occupants were Nonconformists rather than followers of the Church of England.  The latter was the Established Church in England, and various Acts of Parliament put restrictions on worship at places other than its own churches; but these were gradually relaxed, and by the 18th century many new Christian denominations had emerged, all categorised under the general name \"Nonconformist\".  Such denominations were particularly strong in rural parts of East Sussex, and Calvinistic beliefs were especially popular.  Meetings were commonly held in houses, barns or similar buildings, and groups were generally aligned to either the Independent movement or a Calvinistic interpretation of Baptist beliefs.  (The term \"Strict Baptist\" to describe such views developed in the 19th century \"with the purpose of organising a range of Calvinistic Baptist causes within a denominational identity\".) Several small-scale meetings of Calvinistic pastors and worshippers took place in the Dicker area from the late 18th century: in barns, houses and above an ironmonger's shop near the brickworks.  In 1812, a permanent chapel was founded by James Dunk for the Vinalls, father-and-son preachers who were well-known at the time in East Sussex.  Dunk's Chapel, later known as Little Dicker Chapel and now as Golden Cross Chapel, was completed and licensed in 1813.  The red-brick building was set back from the main road and was described from the start as a \"Calvinistic Independent\" chapel.  The cause was popular, and the building was soon too small to accommodate worshippers who regularly travelled from a long distance; so in 1837 the trustees of Dunk's Chapel paid \u00a320 for some land further along the main road next to the brickworks and spent \u00a3422 on a \"large and comfortable\" new building with a capacity of 400 worshippers.  It was opened in 1838 by William Gadsby, and local resident William Cowper (at whose house worship had taken place before Dunk's Chapel was built) was installed as the first pastor. The chapel was initially constituted for a mixed congregation, serving both Calvinistic Baptists and Independents.  This did not work, and it was reconstituted solely as a Strict Baptist church in 1839.  Thereafter, the cause was successful: the religious census carried out across England in March 1851 found that 320 worshippers attended on census day.  In 1864, during the pastorate of George Drake, the chapel became aligned to the Gospel Standard tradition, which emerged in the late 1850s following a schism in Strict Baptist theology.  The Gospel Standard movement was associated with the magazine of that name, first published in 1835.  Zoar Chapel maintains this alignment as of . The cause was prosperous and relatively wealthy compared to other Strict Baptist chapels, and to cater for the large number of worshippers the building was extended in 1874 at a cost of \u00a3600.  Worshippers came from many miles around, as was common in rural areas, and the chapel was built with stabling for 40 horses and carts for the benefit of those who rode to Lower Dicker.  These facilities were erected before 1875 and consisted of \"a long brick-and-tile building\".  A terrace of houses called Chapel Cottages were erected on behalf of a member of the congregation in 1875, and the small burial ground next to the chapel was enlarged to the rear in 1880. Although the building had been completed in 1838, it was opened on 22 September 1837, and Silver Jubilee events were held on 22 September 1887.  By that time the building had a capacity of 800, and nearly 1,000 people attended the Jubilee afternoon service.  Between 1837 and 1990, the chapel had six permanent pastors, some of whom served for many years: John W. Sperling-Tyler, a chiropodist who was active in the Gospel Standard movement, was the incumbent for 51 years.  Supply preachers served when permanent pastors were not resident. The chapel was registered for worship under legislation in place before the Places of Worship Registration Act 1855 was passed, so although it has an entry on the General Register (under the terms of that Act of Parliament) it has been allocated the default registration number 1.  It was also registered for the conduct of marriages on 4 January 1844. A Strict Baptist chapel in the nearby hamlet of Ripe, which opened in 1830 and closed in 1948, was served from Zoar Chapel for many years.  Services were held in a barn until the Hebron Calvinistic Chapel, a \"quaint little\" red-brick building, was completed.  It was demolished soon after its closure.  Stairs led from the adjacent road to the chapel, whose fa\u00e7ade was windowless."

The building is Classical in style with some Georgian elements.  The front is rendered and has a gabled roof with an open pediment in which a recessed circular plaque is inset.  This gives the dates of construction (1837) and enlargement (1874).  Also on the fa\u00e7ade are pilasters and an entrance porch.  All of this work dates from the 1874 enlargement.

        "content": "Several people associated with Zoar Chapel and the Dicker area have been linked to other Baptist and Calvinistic congregations in Sussex, all of which are still in existence.  Members of the Dicker family lived in the district from the 13th century until the early 20th century, and it is not known whether the area is named after them or vice versa.  Thomas Dicker (b. 1723) adopted Calvinist beliefs in 1773, held services at his house in Buxted and later donated land in that parish upon which Five Ash Down Independent Chapel was built in 1784.  His son, also Thomas (b. 1753), joined the Bethel Strict Baptist Chapel in Wivelsfield and helped to found a Strict Baptist Chapel in Uckfield in 1789.  He then became the pastor at a chapel in Hailsham.  William Cowper, the first pastor of Zoar Chapel, lived at Providence Cottage in Upper Dicker; in the 1970s documents were found there which related to the ministry of James Reed of Chiddingly, a prominent Baptist preacher of the late 18th century.  William Vine, the third pastor at Zoar Chapel, was previously linked to the Strict Baptist chapel in Hailsham.  Ebenezer Chapel at Bodle Street Green changed from Independent to Strict Baptist in 1864 as a result of its new pastor's involvement with Zoar Chapel: originally an Independent, he was received into the Strict Baptist Church at Lower Dicker and asked for Ebenezer Chapel to realign in the same way before he accepted the pastorate."

Its style is Gothic Revival, with walls of cream brick, buttresses, a rose window above the main entrance, lancet windows, and a 150-foot corner tower turned 45 degrees from the rest of the building. The steeple is octagonal, with four clocks from the Seth Thomas Co. The church is close to the same design that Mix used for First Methodist in Monroe. Behind the church on 7th Street is the Chapel of the Holy Spirit. It was originally built in 1849 as an early fire station \u2014 Engine House No. 3. In 1899 it was donated to the church and converted to a chapel. In 1930 it was restyled Gothic Revival to complement the church. In 1898 the parish built a guildhall west of the firehouse. It is styled Gothic Revival like the other buildings, with lancet windows and a cross in the brickwork. Between 1905 and 1910 the rectory was added, a -story cream-brick building designed by A. Arthur Guilbert in Gothic Revival style. It has since been converted to serve as Parish Center, with an auditorium added in 1956."

The toponym derives from the ancient people of the Gallianates, whose name is mentioned in a Roman altar dedicated to Matronis Braecorium Gallianatium Starting from the 2nd century, the worship of ancient gods such as Jupiter, Minerva and the Capitoline Triad was replaced by the Christian religion, in particular during the evangelization effort of Ambrose in the late 4th century. In the 5th century a Palaeo-Christian basilica, acting as the pieve of Cant\u00f9, existed in the site, perhaps with a baptstry. Of this structure, the black and white marble pavement remains in the current edifice's presbytery. The current church was begun in the 10th century. The basilica was re-consecrated by Aribert, archbishop of Milan, who at the time was likely the hereditary tenant of the edifice: this is testified by the presence of graffitoes under the apse's frescoes, which mention the death of his father, brother and nephew. The church was nearly ruined at the time of archbishop Charles Borromeo (1560\u20131584). Later it was abandoned and used as peasants' store and lost the small right aisle in a fire. Other sections went lost during the French occupation in the early 19th century, when they were considered of no artistic interest and sold to private collectors.

The apse protrudes substantially from the main body. It features an archaic type of Lombard bands, with isolated arches characterized by pilasters that connect them to the ground. There are three windows which give light to the crypt: these are slightly different from those of the nave, due to the presence of a slight internal slope. The only remaining side apse is partly visible at the right. The crypt, and subsequently the presbytery, are more elevated than in other Romanesque buildings. The crypt has two halls with cross vaults, above which, originally, were two ambons: today only part of the left one remains, with a marble eagle which once supported the lectern. The church is known for the frescoes which cover the nave's walls and the apse. The latter are likely earlier than the former, as testified by the different style. The apse frescoes show two bands of pictures with animals and vegetable motifs. They are surmounted by a praying Jesus within an almond frame. Jesus is wearing sandals, an uncommon feature of such depictions. He is flanked by two old men, the prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel, behind whom are the two archangels Michael and Gabriel and two crowds. The lower walls of the apse show a short cycle of stories of St Vincent of Saragossa. The fourth panel features St Aribert offering a model of the church to God: the upper part of this scene is now at the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana of Milan. Next to the church is the contemporary Baptistry of St John, which was built at the same time. Its plan is inspired by that of the 9th century Santa Maria presso San Satiro in Milan, although in a simplified form: a cruciform shape with a square hall limited by four isolated columns and four perpendicular arches, and four semicircular niches. The western niche opens to the interior, from which stairs lead to the matronei (tribunes in the upper floor), which are not present in San Satiro. The interior ends with a dome, externally covered by an octagonal drum with four windows and small arches."

It is a substantial house whose architecture includes Late Victorian and Classical Revival elements.  It is significant as a well-preserved artifact from the boom period in Lehi's development. The house was built by/for Christian Knudsen, a successful stockman who was prominent in his industry and also known in the town for his philanthropy and for his service in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  While Knudsen and others made money from cattle, other wealth in Lehi derived from the Utah Sugar Company Factory based there; both industries benefited from the railroad which had first connected Lehi in 1872\u2014the same year that Christian Knudsen, 15 years old, arrived with his family from Norway.  The wealth and connection to the rest of the nation brought awareness of architectural styles, and many elaborate homes were built. Knudsen married Sarah L. Otteson, of Spanish Fork in 1879 and they had 10 children.  His Mormon church service included doing a mission that took him to Norway in 1896, and serving as head teacher in the Sunday school.  According to the National Register nomination, the house was intended to stand until the Millennium.  The Knudsens donated significantly to help build the Stake houses (Mormon administration offices) in Alpine, Lehi, and Provo. The house is also of interest for serving, under the Knudsens, as a \"halfway house for Scandinavian travelers on their way to and from Salt Lake City.\" Much later, during World War II, the house served as a relocation center for four \"Japanese\" families.  (Note that the Topaz War Relocation Center, one of 10 Japanese-American internment camps was located in rural area only about 110 miles away.)  It was renovated into three apartments to help address Lehi's wartime housing shortage.  Lehi was the location near to Camp Williams, the Geneva Steel Plant, and industry in the Salt Lake Valley. The building was converted back to a single family house in 1964 and a restoration of the house began in 1985. The restored home was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998."

The interior has a vestibule area, whose inner wall dividing it from the main space helps support the tower, and a galleried hall. Interior decorations are partly reflective of later 19th-century alterations, including the placement of pulpit and sounding board, and the trompe-l'\u0153il artwork. The church was built in 1825-26 for a congregation that was established in 1752. Its design was at one time attributed to Charles Bulfinch, but there is no documentary evidence that supports this connection, and the building clearly has Federal-style elements inspired by the publications of Asher Benjamin. The clock in its tower is owned by the town; the first was installed in 1856, the present one in 1947. The bell was installed in 1828."

The district encompasses 158 contributing buildings in the town of Accomac, mainly grouped into two periods of construction. From its founding in 1786 through the second quarter of the nineteenth century, several residential, commercial, governmental, and religious structures were built in the core of Accomac, representing both high-style and vernacular examples of late Georgian, Federal, and Greek Revival styles. Notable structures surviving from this period include the rectory of St. George's Episcopal Parish (1798, 1811); the Seymour House (1791-1815); Roseland (1750-1850); Seven Gables (1786-1905); Rural Hill (1816, 1835), and the Francis Makemie Presbyterian Church (1840). The second period of construction reflected in the town dates to the last quarter of the nineteenth century, when the arrival of the New York, Philadelphia, and Norfolk Railroad spawned renewed growth and economic prosperity in Accomack County following the Civil War. These buildings also display both high-style and vernacular expressions of Victorian Era styles, including Second Empire, Italianate, Gothic Revival, and Romanesque. Notable structures from this time period include Bayly Memorial Hall (a former Baptist Church built in 1870 and later moved), the County Clerk's Office (1887), the Accomack County Courthouse (1899), and houses found in the Lilliston Avenue extension of the town built in the 1880s-1890s. There are also contributing structures dating from the first quarter of the twentieth century, including the Drummondtown Baptist Church (1914), Drummondtown United Methodist Church (1920), and the former hotel at the town square (1925). There are three structures within the Accomac Historic District which are listed separately on the National Register of Historic Places. They are the Debtors' Prison, the Bank Building, and St. James Episcopal Church. The Accomac Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992."

This provision was met when the necessary stock was raised, and the Bank of the Valley of Virginia branch in Romney was opened around 1825 in the Wirgman Building.

The shareholders of the Bank of Romney petitioned the Secretary of State of West Virginia for a charter with capital stock totaling $30,000. Following the state's approval of its charter, the Bank of Romney commenced its operations in the Wirgman Building on December 20, 1888. The bank occupied two rented rooms on the building's first floor, which it shared with a pharmacy. The Bank of Romney initially used a safe as its bank vault, and security for the bank was provided by a nightwatchman who slept in one of the bank's two rooms. The Wirgman Building's security was further enhanced with the installation of wire mesh glass and bars in the windows. During the bank's occupation at the Wirgman Building, Henry Bell Gilkeson served as the bank's president.

Having outgrown its 1906 building, the Bank of Romney returned across East Main Street to the site of the Wirgman Building following completion of its new, larger headquarters facility in 1966."

An Art Deco concrete building, it was built in 1934 to replace the original Fairbanks school, a wooden building constructed in 1907 which burned down in late 1932.  As Fairbanks grew exponentially with the military buildup associated with World War II and the Cold War, the building was enlarged in 1939 and again in 1948. It was the city's only school from its opening in 1934 until the opening of Denali Elementary School in 1951.  It became a junior/senior high school for several years until Lathrop High School began operation.  The school then became Main Junior High School until it was replaced by Ryan Junior High School and Tanana Junior High School during the early 1970s. Following the disestablishment of Main Junior High, instruction in the building was mostly limited to alternative education programs.  The building's primary purpose at that point was to house the administrative offices of the Fairbanks North Star Borough School District, a role it filled from 1976 until 1993.  Most of those offices moved to the school district's current Fifth Avenue headquarters in the mid 1980s, and the building sat largely vacant for many years, eventually being completely abandoned. The building has housed city offices since 1994, which moved from the longtime Fairbanks City Hall three blocks to the north.  In addition to city offices, the former school gymnasium is home to the Fairbanks Boys & Girls Club.  Previous non-governmental tenants of the building under city ownership have included the Fairbanks Boxing Club and the Greater Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990 as Main School."

The Beaux-Arts architecture firm of Carr\u00e8re and Hastings was hired to design the building. The firm had achieved prominence with the design for the New York Public Library in 1897. The mansion was started in 1903 and completed in 1905. An addition was built in 1967 on the north side that doubled the available space for the library. In 2003, the library underwent a second expansion, for $14 million, which increased its capacity by 100,000 books."

Ross gave the couple  and several slaves, who provided labor to build the house, which has been called The Hemlocks after the two massive hemlock trees that grow in front of the house. The Edwards family owned the house from 1838 until about 1900 when the Fowler family, originally from Knoxville, Tennessee, bought the house. The house has remained structurally unchanged for over 175 years, making the Edwards Fowler house the oldest and only Federal-style house in Anderson County, Tennessee. The house was constructed of locally quarried limestone and bricks made on the site. Foundations of slave cabins exist behind the house. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 29, 1975."

Construction of the building started in 1881 and was funded by the son of Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov, Semyon Mikhailovich who recently returned from the 1877-78 Russo-Turkish War. The construction of the palace that was initially designed by French architect \u00c9tienne Bouchard in the Louis XIII style was soon suspended after the death of Prince Semyon Mikhailovich Vorontsov. In 1889 the unfinished palace was bought by the Russian Imperial Domains Agency for Alexander III of Russia.  The new owner commissioned his favorite architect Maximilian Messmacher to modernize the villa's design. Although Massandra was listed among imperial residences, no royals ever stayed there over night (rather preferring the neighboring Livadia Palace). After the October Revolution and before World War II, the residence was used as a government sanatorium \"Proletarian Health\" for people ill with tuberculosis. After World War II it was used as a state cottage (dacha) under the name \"Stalinskaya\". After the fall of the Soviet Union, Massandra Palace was used as one of the Ukrainian official residences where were signed the Massandra Accords in 1993. In 2014 after the Russian annexation of Crimea, the residence was taken over by the Russian Presidential Affairs Administration. A bust of Alexander III was unveiled in front of the villa in 2017."

The chairman of the Bank of Valletta, whose headquarters is located close to the arch, promised to build a replica of the arch but initially nothing materialized. In 2012, the Fleur-de-Lys Administrative Committee and the Birkirkara Local Council announced that they were planning to rebuild the arch to the same dimensions of the original. The police force had initially objected to the project, believing it could become a traffic hazard, but of similar risk comparisons to other monumental arches and gates in Malta, such as the Portes de Bombes. The plans were eventually approved by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority in October of the same year, but they were placed on hold since a tender appeal had to be sorted out. In April 2013, the tender was awarded to Vaults Ltd instead of V&C Contractors who had originally won the tender. The replica arch cost \u20ac280,000 to build, and \u20ac100,000 of these were donated by the Bank of Valletta. \u20ac40,000 were taken from the Good Causes Fund, while the remaining \u20ac140,000 were paid by the Birkirkara Local Council. While preparations were being made for rebuilding the arch, a dispute arose between the Birkirkara and Santa Venera Local Councils on what to call the arch. The former said that it should be called Fleur-de-Lys Gate, while the latter insisted on using the name Wignacourt Arch. In September 2013, the Santa Venera council took the Birkirkara council to court and accused it of causing \"historical damage\" by calling the arch with an incorrect name. The councils agreed on using the name The Wignacourt Arch known as the Fleur-de-Lys Gate in August 2014. Reconstruction of the arch began on 1 August 2014, but work stopped soon afterwards after part of the original arch's foundations was found. Reconstruction continued in January 2015, and it was complete by the end of November 2015. Some finishing touches were made in February 2016, including the installation of two marble plaques. The arch was inaugurated on 28 April 2016 by Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and mayor of Birkirkara Joanne Debono Grech. A plaque with the coat of arms of Birkirkara and the following inscription was installed to commemorate the reconstruction:"

Its entrance is recessed in an archway, with sidelight and fanlight transom windows.  The third house, a double house at 30-32 Pleasant Street, was built in 1818 by Daniel's brother Joseph.  It is three stories in height, built of brick with granite trim like the others, and has entrances styled similar to those of John's house. At the time Daniel How built his house, it directly overlooked the waterfront and Casco Bay to the northeast, and Commercial Street, which parallels Danforth on the waterfront, did not exist.  The properties have in the intervening years been hemmed in by later commercial development, but are a well-preserved reminder of the area's early 19th-century appearance."

He apprenticed to a tinmaker, but went into business in 1882 as a partner in a hardware store.  However, when he had this house built in 1888, he embraced the use of tinwork as a middle-class version of the architectural details that a wealthy homeowner would have rendered in stone.  The tinwork was likely produced by Schmidt's foreman Herman Dieterle, who had built a regional reputation as a master craftsman and metalworker since 1862. Schmidt became the sole owner of the hardware business in 1893 and ultimately served as president of the Minnesota Hardware Retailers Association.  After his death, his widow Clara Schmidt donated to the city the open lot east of the house, which became known as Schmidt Park. The Schmidt House is the last Italianate example of some 20 brick residences surviving from the 19th century in Wabasha.  All were built by the first two generations of the city's merchant class, forming a distinctive architectural stock that contrasts with the elaborate wood-frame Victorian architecture that characterized most other communities in Minnesota.  As time went on the choice of building material appears to have been a matter of local taste rather than accessibility, as Wabasha was not a major brick manufacturer compared to Lake City and Red Wing upriver."

It is set on a wooded ridge southwest of the town center, its east flank traversed by Stub Hollow Road.  The house is set at the crest of the ridge, with expansive views to the west and southwest.  It is a -story structure, with a frame of steel finished with cement stucco.  It is an asymmetrical but roughly rectangular mass, with a flat roof, cantilevered decks, and a prominent curved wall section.  It has grouped windows, including at some of its corners, and is generally devoid of exterior ornamentation.  A spiral staircase provides access between the rooftop terrace and lower outside spaces.  Interior features include a curved soapstone fireplace, and extensive use of fluorescent lighting, a technology in its infancy at the time of the house's construction. The house was commissioned from William Lescaze, a Swiss architect, in 1929 by Frederick Vanderbilt Field, a scion of the Vanderbilt family railroad fortune who was disinherited for his political views.  Lescaze was at the time also designing the PSFS Building, the nation's first International style skyscraper.  When completed, this house was the first country house of that style, being preceded in residential architecture only by the Lovell House of Richard Neutra."

In 1923 it was converted into a mixed use building by Doctors Lincoln and Elizabeth Beaver, who were both chiropractors. They converted the front room into their office and lived in the rest of the house.  They remained here until 1940.  The house is significant for a couple of reasons.  First, it call attention to the importance of small real estate developers and contractor-builders in the suburban residential development of Des Moines during the 1910s.  Secondly, it calls attention to the importance of the streetcar in stimulating higher land use along its routes.  The Trent-Beaver House was located along the 6th Avenue streetcar line, which helped the conversion of this single-family dwelling into a professional office. It was part of a wider movement of professional services from the central business district to the suburban areas that public transportation made possible.   The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996."

Ball became the first Civil Commissioner of Malta, a post he held from 1799 to 1801 and again from 1802 until his death on 25 October 1809. Ball was widely loved and respected by the Maltese people. In December 1809, the Maltese set up a committee of \"Deputies of the Nation\" and petitioned the Acting Commissioner Francis Chapman to build a monument dedicated to Ball. The Lower Barrakka Gardens was chosen as the site to build the monument, since its location on the fortifications overlooking the Grand Harbour was appropriate to honour a naval officer, and it was an area popular with the local population. The strategic location of the monument made it a powerful symbol of British rule in Malta. The monument was constructed in 1810, and its design is attributed to the Maltese architect Giorgio Pullicino. The monument was built using funds collected by the local population. The monument deteriorated quickly after its construction since it is exposed to the elements. In 1883, Captain E. H. Seymour formed a committee to restore it, and it was restored the following year by Andrea Vassallo under the supervision of Emanuele Luigi Galizia. The restored monument was inaugurated by Governor Sir Lintorn Simmons on 18 December 1884. The monument was restored once again in 2001, as part of an overall restoration and rehabilitation of the Lower Barrakka."

In 1706, he sold the property to Phillip French, who left it to his three daughters. This tract was later split between Cornelius Van Horne, husband of Elizabeth French, and Joseph Reade, husband of Anne French, as recorded in a 1722 deed. Jacob Janeway purchased an 84-acre lot that included the site of the house, . Philip Van Horne (1719\u20131793), son of Cornelius, then purchased the lot from Janeway's estate in 1750. During the French and Indian War, Philip Van Horne was a colonel in the Somerset County militia. In 1759, he was appointed a judge in the Court of Common Pleas for Somerset County. He was known for his great hospitality, to both sides of the war, and his house became known as Convivial Hall or Convivial Hill. Andrew D. Mellick, Jr. in his book, The Story of an Old Farm, reports that Van Horne had \"five handsome and well-bred daughters who were the much admired toasts of both armies.\" His eldest daughter, Mary Ricketts, married Irish American Colonel Stephen Moylan on September 12, 1778. American Captain Alexander Graydon (1752\u20131818) writes that: \"His house, used as a hotel, seemed constantly full.\" and notes that General George Washington was concerned:  Mellick writes: At the Battle of Bound Brook, on April 13, 1777, Van Horne hosted British General Charles Cornwallis for breakfast and American Generals Benjamin Lincoln and Nathanael Greene for supper. During the second Middlebrook encampment (winter of 1778\u201379), Major General William Alexander, Lord Stirling used the house as his headquarters. Stirling took over command of the Middlebrook encampment on December 21, 1778, when Washington left to meet with Congress in Philadelphia, until he returned about February 5, 1779. General Henry Lee, Light-Horse Harry, and other officers were also quartered here. On October 26, 1779, British Lt. Col. John Graves Simcoe led a group of the Queen's Rangers to search for and capture New Jersey Governor William Livingston or Colonel Moylan. He raided several houses in Bound Brook before arriving here, but did not find his targets. After taking prisoners at the house, he continued on to Van Veghten's Bridge. In 1934, the house was purchased by the Calco Chemical Company, later American Cyanamid. The company had previously established a large manufacturing facility on the adjoining property, starting in 1916. Starting in 1937, company executive John McMurray had the house restored, \"in colonial period\", to be used as corporate guest quarters.

Cary probably constructed buildings, but it's unclear if he built the surviving cobblestone house or if Samuel S. Jones built the house in 1849, after he bought the property. Jones was a New Yorker who settled on this farm after marrying Margaret Richardson. Regardless of who built the house, its Greek Revival style was common for stylish houses in the 1840s. Identifying features of the style are the low-pitched roof, the cornice returns, the frieze board beneath the eaves, and the simple straight lintels above the windows. Less common in Greek Revival residences are the two wings and the cobblestone exterior. Between limestone quoins on the corners, the cobblestones are set in horizontal courses. The cobbles on the front of the house are carefully matched for size and color. Stones on the sides and back are more varied. Parts of the south and west walls were covered with stucco in the early 1900s, but this is of historical interest, since it was common in the Clinton area at that time. Jones' youngest son Samuel S. Jones took over the farm. and became a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly. After him, his daughter Rachel and husband Clayton Storey farmed there. The farm was sold outside the family in the 1920s. As of 1977 the house was the largest of thirteen cobblestone houses remaining in Rock county."

More precisely, it is an early-Gothic building with Romanesque elements that dates back to the beginning of the 13th century (mentioned in 1208), partly reconstructed after World War II. It was the centre for the Cistercians of Trzebnica, which is why it was called the House of the Ladies of Trzebnica. Nearby, along the Kotlarska Street, were the Nowe Jatki, a medieval shopping center belonging to the monastery. The building was erected on a trapezoidal plan made of brick laid in a Wendish thread (two-wheeled, also called Slavonic). The Romanesque elements of this building, including the arches in the central part, are mixed with Gothic details of the windows and the arches of the vaults. On each of the two floors of the building there were originally three rooms. The building was repeatedly rebuilt, and remained the property of the monastery until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1810. During WWII the site around Bishop Nankier's Square was damaged. During the renovation in 1959, historic fragments of the oldest architectural foundation of the building located under the street level were discovered. From 1966 to 1969, the site was partially reconstructed according to the project of Henryk Dziurla. Over eight centuries, the level of neighbouring streets has risen to the height of the upper storey of the building, which is why the entrance today is subterranean. In the southern part of the lower storey there are fragments of the old barrel vaults, and on the upper floor, cross vaults. During the reconstruction the ceiling was partially removed, joining the upper and lower storeys, and the whole building was covered with a contemporary reinforced concrete roof. The above-ground part was glazed from the outside. The place was then adapted for the needs of the art gallery under the patronage of the Center for Cultural Arts in Wroc\u0142aw (OKiS). Later, the gallery was transformed into Foto-Medium-Art Gallery, and become one of the most important Neo-avantgarde centres in Poland. Then it changed its name to the Lower Silesia Centre of Photography, \"Romanesque House\". From January 2017 it is called the Foto-Gen Gallery. In April 2017, a bronze plaque commemorating the Cistercian foundation \"House of the Ladies of Trzebnica\" was placed in the facade of the building and the name Dom Panien Trzebnickich (House of the Ladies of Trzebnica) came back into official use . Foto-Gen Gallery specializes in showing photography and new media. There are regular exhibitions for home and international artists, presentations as well as lectures organized there. Media reportages from these events can be seen on Centre for Cultural Arts in Wroc\u0142aw (OKiS) video channel, local and nationwide media."

In it, Pipes designed not only the building but also the landscape, furnishings, and interior finishes, representing the culmination of his work as a pivotal figure in the Arts and Crafts movement in Oregon, while also giving a nod to the Northwest Regional style. Built in 1954 on a lot fronting Oswego Lake, it is distinguished by clean, flowing lines, attention to its setting, a rubblestone wall buffering it from the nearby street, one of Pipes' signature bay windows, a central courtyard, and other features. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. By 2018, most of the house's significant features were either significantly deteriorated or gone altogether, including the complete loss of Pipes' custom furniture and built-ins. This loss of integrity prompted the owner to petition for it to be removed from the National Register."

        "content": "The Camino del Monte Sol Historic District, in Santa Fe, New Mexico, is a  historic district which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.  The listing included 106 contributing buildings. It includes some works by architect John Gaw Meem, and works by notable artists if not certified architects. The district is in the southeast corner of Santa Fe, to the south of the Santa Fe River, and extends south of the Acequia Madre (Mother Ditch).  It consists mostly of north-south streets.  It adjoins the National Register-listed Santa Fe Historic District to the north and west.  It is roughly bounded by the Acequia Madre, Camino del Monte Sol, El Caminito, and Garcia St. Its significance was described in its 1987 National Register nomination:Beginning in the years following New Mexican statehood in 1912, and continuing until World War II, this district was the center of a nationally known colony of artists, a remarkable group of multi-talented, creative people, many of whom had national reputations before settling in a remote and little known region of the country. These artists made important contributions not only to their own fields, primarily literature and painting, but also to the community to the extent that they can be considered in large part responsible for the unique milieu of Santa Fe today. Although no longer functioning as a colony, many creative people continue to live in Santa Fe and contribute to its character. The city depends heavily on tourists who are drawn not only by its 150 galleries many of which specialize in Indian and Spanish artists and regional art, and by its yearly markets and traditions like the annual Fiesta, but also by the special environment created by its architecture. The artists who founded Santa Fe's original art colony were drawn to the region by its pre-American cultures and were instrumental in efforts to preserve and revive the fine arts, crafts, customs, and architecture of those cultures. The artists* colony had perhaps its most widely felt impact in the field of architecture. Although the movement to preserve and recreate the city's historic adobe architecture was already under way when the colony began to come together on the Camino del Monte Sol, the artists joined it with vigor, leading efforts to preserve historic architecture and building their own Pueblo Revival adobe houses. The district also contains some of the first houses designed by John Gaw Meem, the premier professional architect of the Revival styles. It has remained a residential neighborhood, unlike Canyon Road, a street north of the boundary of this district and included in the Santa Fe Historic District, where artists lived which has become predominantly commercial. The artists' homes on the Camino del Monte Sol and adjoining streets are a unique grouping of Pueblo Revival and, to a much lesser extent, Territorial Revival dwellings, built by the group who played a significant role in the conversion of Santa Fe into a city which is dominated by historic styles. \"Artists who were leaders of the art colony and prime contributors to the architectural and cultural character\" of the district include: Alice Corbin Henderson (1881-1949) and William Penhallow Henderson (1877-1943), of 555 Camino del Monte Sol and 557 Camino del Monte Sol; Frank Applegate, of 830 El Caminito, 831 El Caminito, and 408 Camino del Monte Sol;"

The current madrasa, however, was completely rebuilt by one of his successors, Sultan al-Ashraf Qaytbay, after whom it is named. Al-Ashraf Qaytbay was one of the last powerful and successful sultans of the Mamluk Empire which ruled from Cairo, Egypt. He was originally a mamluk purchased by Sultan al-Ashraf Barsbay (ruled 1422\u20131438) and served under several Mamluk sultans. Qaytbay succeeded Timurbugha as sultan at the age of 54, and ruled for nearly 29 years from 1468 to 1496, the second-longest reign of any Mamluk sultan (after al-Nasir Muhammad).  Despite rebellions and other challenges, he is known as an effective ruler who brought long-term stability while he remained in power, and is especially notable as one of the greatest patrons of architecture in the Mamluk period, and particularly of the Burji Mamluk period which was otherwise marked by Egypt's relative decline. He is known for at least 85 structures which he built or restored in Egypt, Syria, Palestine, and Mecca, including 17 in Cairo, and this period is characterized by a refinement of the Mamluk architectural style. Qaytbay saw Khushqadam's madrasa in 1475 and apparently did not think highly of it. In 1478 CE  (883 AH), he endowed a quarter of the revenues of Mulabbis to the establishment of two new institutions: the Madrasa Al-Ashrafiyya, and a mosque in Gaza. Qaytbay's new madrasa, replacing the old one by Khushqadam, was built between 1480 and 1482 CE. As Qaytbay estimated that local craftsmanship did not live up to his standards, he commissioned a team of builders and artisans from Cairo, including a Coptic architect, to work on this project. This marks a relatively rare occasion where a Mamluk sultan commissioned a construction project of such significance outside of Cairo. Just three months after the completion of the madrasa, Qaytbay then ordered the sabil (fountain house or water dispensary) to its northeast to be rebuilt, resulting in the Sabil of Qaytbay still standing there today. A strong earthquake destroyed much of the upper floor of the madrasa in 1496. Today, only parts of the lower stories have survived, but the original structure is known thanks to extensive contemporary documentation and modern-day investigation of its remains."

The facade of the building is 25 meters wide and projects in front of the long arcade which runs along the western boundary of the Haram al-Sharif, which would have made the madrasa very prominent, a feature likely owed to its royal patronage. The madrasa is bounded on the north side by the 15th-century Uthmaniyya Madrasa, while to the south rises the minaret of Bab al-Silsila. The madrasa was centered around a large rectangular courtyard similar to those built by Qaytbay earlier at his own funerary mosque-madrasa in Cairo and in other late Mamluk madrasas of the period. However, the eastern side of the courtyard was taken up by a triple-arched loggia which, thanks to its elevated position, provided an unimpeded view of the Dome of the Rock. Living quarters for students were arranged around another upper courtyard or terrace built over the adjacent Baladiyya Madrasa. According to Muj\u012br al-D\u012bn al-'Ulaym\u012b, who was a historian at that time, the madrasa was the third jewel of Masjid Bayt al-Maqdis (the Haram Al-Sharif) after al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock."

The seventh bay has three spandrel\u2013windows, with the center spandrel\u2013window being wider than the outer ones. The western elevation on Madison Avenue has four bays. The second bay from north has a recessed entrance, which leads to the ground-story banking space inside and was the main entrance prior to 2004. Above the entrance doorway are four windows; the space beneath these window panes is taken up by an octagonal clock and a sign. The first and third bays from north, respectively to the left and right of the Madison Avenue banking entrance, contain a large window pane at ground level and three spandrel\u2013windows above. The fourth bay from north is seven spandrels wide, but there are ventilation grates instead of windows at the mezzanine. This bay has a double door of metal and glass, which leads to a storefront, as well as a shop window. The third floor has a set of window openings on both 40th Street and Madison Avenue. Along 40th Street, the third-floor window openings are asymmetrically arranged on either side of the main entrance, with twelve to the west (right) of the entrance and six to the east (left). All except one of these openings contain sash windows; the remaining opening has a louver. The openings are separated by silver geometric motifs. Architectural writer Christopher Gray wrote the motifs \"could be kissing owls, or hooded figures, or the face cards in a deck from another planet\". This motif is repeated several times above the main entrance, which is flanked by two flagpoles. On Madison Avenue, there are eight such openings, separated by geometric motifs. Two of these openings have two sash windows each, while the others have one sash window each."

        "content": "The 4th through 43rd stories have pilasters of continuous white brick, alternating with bays of windows and spandrels. The windows were designed to be flush with the brick. Franzheim avoided decorative elements such as cornices, entablatures, and pediments, as he wanted the building to be \"shadow-less\". Instead, the tower was to rely exclusively on the contrast between white and black materials for decoration. Terracotta spandrels, between the white pilasters, separate the windows on different stories; they were meant to emphasize the building's height. According to Stern, the spandrels were inspired by those on Raymond Hood's nearby Daily News Building. The northern and western elevations of the 4th through 23rd stories are designed with white pilasters and dark spandrels, with a few exceptions. At some of the setbacks on the northern and western elevations, the black spandrels are decorated with white-brick geometric shapes. Some of the setbacks also have ornamented white-brick lintels just beneath them. The eastern elevation below the 23rd story has windows within an otherwise flat white-brick wall. The southern elevation below the 23rd story only has windows at the setbacks. Above the 23rd story, the tower rises as a rectangular shaft, with six bays on the northern elevation and five bays each on the western and eastern elevations. This gives the tower an almost square shape. The two southernmost bays on the western elevation have black panels. The south elevation has eight bays, of which only the three easternmost bays have windows. has black vertical stripes in the first, third, fourth, and fifth bays from west and a pipe in the second bay from the west; only the three easternmost bays have windows. The top of the shaft has a few geometric decorations, similar to those used on the lower section of the tower. The rooftop parapet originally had black-and-white chevron-shaped motifs as well as projecting white brick at the tops of the pilasters. At the roof is a two-story penthouse, which has ribbon windows, steel walls, and chamfered corners. A metal pipe railing and two tiers of rooftop terraces are at the top of the penthouse."

Jones expressed interest in developing buildings in New York City and, in 1923, he founded Houston Properties, headed by Alfred B. Jones of New Jersey. Kenneth Franzheim was involved in designing several of Houston Properties' developments; he was part of a relatively small \"business family\" from which Jesse Jones tended to hire."

        "content": "In July 1929, the New York Trust Company acquired the property at 275 Madison Avenue, abutting its branch office at number 277. The next month, Philip H. Rosenbach of the Rosenbach Company sold number 273 to the 273 Madison Avenue Corporation. In April 1930, Jesse Jones approached both the New York Trust Company and the owner of 273 Madison Avenue with the intent of acquiring a site large enough for \"a tall office building\". Frederick Brown had been under contract to purchase number 273, and Jesse Jones intended to lease the site from Brown. Jesse Jones had acquired number 273, as well as two stables on 24 and 26 East 40th Streets, by the following month. He then created the 277 Madison Avenue Corporation. This was part of Jones's frequent practice of creating different companies to operate his building so issues with one property would not affect the others. In preparation for the skyscraper's construction, New York Trust received authorization in May 1930 to open a temporary branch across the street at 274 Madison Avenue. The bank also leased some space in the proposed skyscraper. Plans for the skyscraper, then called 22 East 40th Street, were filed at the end of June 1930. The structure was slated to cost $1.25 million. The Title Guarantee and Trust Company gave the 277 Madison Avenue Corporation a seven-year, $440,000 mortgage, and the project also received a $3.2 million loan. The old residences were demolished starting on June 21, 1930, and excavations began at the end of the following month, July 31. The steelwork was constructed starting on September 4, followed by the brick four weeks later on October 3. The building had topped out by December 1930. The New York Times published several articles about 22 East 40th Street while it was under construction. Jesse Jones had taken out a Reconstruction Finance Corporation loan to fund the building's construction."

        "content": "In early 1931, New York Trust temporarily moved out of its existing offices to allow the completion of the skyscraper. The New York Trust bank branch at 22 East 40th Street opened in July 1931. The renting agents, Cross & Brown, ran advertisements proclaiming that the building was being developed in \"Uptown Wall Street\" and promising \"superior floor arrangements\". Among the earliest office tenants were the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce, the American Bankers Association, the American Safety Razor Company, the Radio Manufacturers Association, accounting firm Haskins & Sells, paper distributor Gottesman & Co., and Swedish royal family relative Folke Bernadotte. Franzheim's office and engineering companies Fish & Loenenger and Krey & Hunt took the top three floors. The early tenants also included law firms, a publicist, a real estate broker, and publishers, as well as attorneys and a firm of sales management engineers. Houston Properties ran into financial difficulties soon after it completed the building. This came with a general downturn in real estate development in the area caused by the Depression. In July 1932, the 275 Madison Avenue Corporation filed a lawsuit against the 277 Madison Avenue Corporation to foreclose on a $5.5 million second mortgage on 22 East 40th Street. The 275 Madison Avenue Corporation was operated by New York Trust, which took over operation in 1933. After the Johns Manville Corporation leased six floors at 22 East 40th Street for its general headquarters in January 1933, the building also became known for the company. Some receivers were named for the building, but their appointments were vacated that December in the New York Supreme Court. The ruling was made on the basis that the plaintiff who had no more than a 2-percent stake in the building. The building continued to face financial difficulties. When the Marine Midland Bank extended a $3.2 million mortgage on the building in 1934, the tax, water, and amortization fees were in arrears due to missed payments. By the late 1930s, the building was increasingly being referred to as 275 Madison Avenue, though some news media still referred to the building by its 40th Street address. 275 Madison Avenue was sold in March 1943 to a group of businessmen, and Brown Wheelock Harris Stevens Inc. took over the leasing. American Home Products simultaneously leased most of the building's top 23 stories as headquarters offices for the main company and nine subsidiaries. The building's valuation was assessed as $3.05 million at the time. American Home Products had reportedly only been interested in buying 275 Madison Avenue if it were able to occupy 13 floors by May 1, 1943."

The deal reportedly involved more than $5 million, all in cash. At the time, American Home Products occupied 17 full stories and portions of seven others, and New York Trust, Johns-Mansville, Procter & Gamble, Babcock & Wilcox, and Provident Mutual Insurance Company also occupied the building. The sale was finalized in January 1952, and Tishman secured a first mortgage of $3.2 million from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Tishman sold the building in 1953 to the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, though Tishman took back a long-term lease. Johns-Manville occupied  on 12 stories, and American Home Products occupied  on 24 stories. The next year, Tishman installed an air-conditioning system in Johns-Manville's offices while 800 employees continued to work in the space. Lawrence Wien and Harry Helmsley took a long-term lease on the building in 1955. The Equity Corporation began operating 275 Madison Avenue in 1959, the same year that American Home Products leased space for a new headquarters at 685 Third Avenue. American Home Products moved out of the building in 1961, leaving  available for lease, about 45 percent of the entire building. The stories being vacated were relatively small, ranging from , so the space was marketed to smaller tenants as cheap offices near Grand Central. Within two years, American Home Products' space was taken by companies in numerous industries. The new lessees included an import/export company, a realty company. an accounting firm, and the Equity Funding Corporation.  In 1962, Madison Park Associates acquired the leasehold from the 22 East 40th Street Equity Corporation; both companies were headed by Stanley and Max Stahl. At the time, the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company owned the structure. Also in the 1960s, Goldman-DiLorenzo bought the land. Johns-Manville, the building's major tenant, announced in 1971 that it would move its corporate headquarters to a suburb of Denver, Colorado. Goldman-DiLorenzo acquired the lease on the building itself in 1973. Goldman-DiLorenzo acquired a $2.8 million mortgage on the property's leasehold, increasing its leverage. This led to large losses when office spaces in comparable buildings began to rise, and the first mortgage holder, CNA Financial, had begun foreclosure proceedings by 1976. The second mortgage was paid down to $1.8 million, and the second-mortgage holder Gibraltar Financial absorbed much of the losses. The Williams Real Estate Company took over management, at which point the building was 15 percent vacant."

The buyer was acting on behalf of foreign syndication firm Gestam Inc., which leased space to ten tenants within months of the purchase. The owner planned to renovate 275 Madison Avenue. At the time, the building's only entrance was on 40th Street, a situation that had existed since the building was constructed. The owners decided to create an expanded lobby and a new entrance within part of the Madison Avenue storefront after the expiration of a lease there. Oppenheimer Brady and Vogelstein designed a $2 million renovation that also included mechanical upgrades and restoration of design features. The new lobby had mirrored wall panels accented with stainless steel, as well as Art Deco chandeliers. Rose marble was imported from the same quarry in France that had provided marble for the original lobby. The former banking space on Madison Avenue was renovated in 1995, and decorative elements on the facade were also restored. By then, the building's tenants included firms in law, accounting, publishing, cosmetics, public relations, and computer publishing. In 1996, the owners of 275 Madison Avenue and the nearby 370 Lexington Avenue received a combined $27.5 million in loans from the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York. Two years later, in 1998, Aby Rosen and Michael Fuchs of RFR Realty bought the lease on 275 Madison Avenue for $42 million. The company had an option to buy the underlying land for $19 million but did not execute the option at that time. The base of the building was modified in 2004, when the main entrance was relocated from Madison Avenue to 40th Street. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the building as a city landmark on January 13, 2009. RFR Realty placed the building for sale in April 2016. The RPW Group, headed by Robert Weisz, offered over $270 million for the building less than two months after the sale was announced. That August, the Blackstone Group and SL Green Realty gave RPW a $240 million loan to finance the purchase. Two years later, RPW refinanced the building with a $210 million loan from Ullico. Saadia Group, parent company of Lord & Taylor, leased some space in early 2021."

The building is privately owned, but generally unoccupied. The house is named after the original owners of the property, the barons of Scammacca. The palace was commissioned in the late 19th century by the Baron Agostino Pennisi di Floristella; the design was by the architect Giuseppe Patricolo. Work was generally complete by 1882. Of note, the private chapel was frescoed in 1905 by Giuseppe Sciuti. The villa was requisitioned at the start of World War II by the German army. Allied bombardment failed to damage it significantly. With the allied occupation of Sicily, the castle was occupied by the British army."
