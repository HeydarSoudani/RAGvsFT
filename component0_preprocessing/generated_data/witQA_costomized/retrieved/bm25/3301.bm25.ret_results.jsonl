{"id": "3301_20", "question": "What channel, network, website or service broadcasted the 2003 Radio Disney Music Awards?", "ctxs": [{"id": "2936_56536", "text": "The network was originally launched as Le FM de Radio-Canada in 1974, with stations in Montreal, Ottawa, Quebec City and Chicoutimi.\nThe network grew slowly. For a long time, its only full-fledged stations outside of Quebec were in Ottawa and Moncton. It presently covers the majority of Quebec, all provincial capitals (though Regina, Victoria, Edmonton, St. John's, Fredericton and Charlottetown are only served by rebroadcasters) and other large cities such as Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver.\nThe network was rebranded as La cha\u00eene culturelle (\"The cultural network\") in 1997 and later as Espace musique in September 2004, the latter as part of a major repositioning of the CBC's French services. Many high-brow cultural programs were moved to Premi\u00e8re Cha\u00eene, while the new Espace musique service adopted a more populist approach focusing on four genres \u2013 classical, jazz, world, and folk music \u2013 and French-language song.\n\n For about two weeks in late August / early September 2004 leading up to the Espace musique relaunch, the network did not have any name, at least officially. The network \"stunted\" with a continuous stream of classical music and jazz, aside from hourly newscasts simulcast from Premi\u00e8re Cha\u00eene and regular reminders that la Cha\u00eene culturelle had shut down and (later) that it would relaunch as Espace musique on September 7.\nThe rebranding was controversial. The network's previous format, largely classical music, had been similar to that of CBC Radio Two, and was indeed regarded by some as superior to its English-language counterpart, leading many cultural commentators to criticize the new format. However, Bureau of Broadcast Measurement ratings taken soon after the relaunch  suggested that the service has indeed become more popular.\n\nUnlike most CBC broadcast networks, from its inception until fall 2010, all ICI Musique transmitters aired the same programming simultaneously on all stations regardless of location, except for (from 2004 to 2010) two weekday evening programs that were interchanged on the British Columbia transmitters.\nSince September 2010, the network has adopted the practice of the CBC's other French-language networks, whereby network programs are broadcast live in the Eastern, Atlantic, and Newfoundland time zones, then aired on tape delay (at the same local times as in the Eastern time zone) in Western Canada. At the same time the network devolved responsibility for the 8:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. (9:30-1:00 AT; formerly from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. / 10:00-4:00 AT) time slot to regional stations. Separate daytime programs were slated to be produced by each of the network's originating stations - the exceptions having been CBAX-FM Halifax, which carried programming produced at CBAL-FM Moncton; and CBCX-FM Calgary / Edmonton, which carried regional programs from CKSB-FM Winnipeg.\nOn May 4, 2011, the network began transmitting on Sirius XM satellite radio channel 153 across North America.  \"Ici musique chansons\" was later moved to channel 163.\nOn June 5, 2013, it was announced that Espace musique would be re-branded as ICI Musique as part of a wider re-branding of the CBC's French-language outlets around the brand \"Ici\". The changes took effect on-air in June 2014, along with the re-branding of the network's website espace.mu as icimusique.ca.On April 10, 2014, further budget cuts were announced for the CBC/Radio-Canada, affecting also Espace Musique, whose regional programming (namely Beau temps, mauvais temps on weekday mornings) was cancelled on June 20.  Since then, the ICI Musique network feed has essentially been a retransmission of flagship CBFX-FM in Montreal.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was the 136th FA Cup final overall of English football's primary cup competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup (FA Cup), organised by the Football Association (FA).   This was a rematch of the 2002 FA Cup Final and the first final since 2003 in which the sides had won once in the Premier League against one another, with a 3\u20130 victory for Arsenal in September 2016, and a 3\u20131 win for Chelsea the following February. The game was broadcast live in the United Kingdom by both BBC and BT Sport. BBC One provided the free-to-air coverage and BT Sport 2 was the pay-TV alternative.  \nThe match was refereed by Anthony Taylor in front of a crowd of 89,472.  Arsenal kicked off and dominated the early stages, opening the scoring with a controversial goal from Alexis S\u00e1nchez in the fourth minute. On 68 minutes, Victor Moses fell in the Arsenal penalty area under pressure and appealed for a penalty but instead was shown his second yellow card by the referee for diving and was sent off.  In the 76th minute, Diego Costa scored for Chelsea to level the score at 1\u20131: he received the ball from Willian and struck the ball past David Ospina, the Arsenal goalkeeper.  Two minutes later Aaron Ramsey scored with a header past Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois after a cross from Olivier Giroud, who had come on as a substitute less than a minute earlier, to make it 2\u20131 to Arsenal.  After four minutes of stoppage time, the whistle was blown and Arsenal won the FA Cup final 2\u20131, to secure a record 13th title, while Ars\u00e8ne Wenger became the most successful manager in the tournament's history with seven wins.\nWinning the FA Cup would have meant Arsenal qualified for the 2017\u201318 UEFA Europa League group stage had they not already secured their place in the competition after finishing fifth in the 2016\u201317 Premier League.

{"id": "3301_36", "question": "What channel broadcast the BRIT Awards?", "ctxs": [{"id": "3301_39369", "text": "The BRIT Awards (often simply called the BRITs) are the British Phonographic Industry's annual popular music awards. The name was originally a shortened form of \"British\", \"Britain\", or \"Britannia\" (in the early days the awards were sponsored by Britannia Music Club), but subsequently became a backronym for British Record Industry Trusts Show. The awards were first held in 1977 and originated as an annual event in 1982 under the auspices of the British record industry's trade association, the BPI. In 1989, they were renamed The BRIT Awards. Mastercard has been the long-term sponsor of the event. In addition, an equivalent awards ceremony for classical music, called the Classic BRIT Awards, was held annually between 2000 and 2013, before being revived in 2018 but has not been held since.\nThe highest profile music awards ceremony in the UK, the BRIT Awards have featured some of the most notable events in British popular culture, such as the final public appearance of Freddie Mercury, the Jarvis Cocker protest against Michael Jackson, the height of a high-profile feud between Oasis and fellow Britpop band Blur, the Union Jack dress worn by Geri Halliwell of the Spice Girls, and a Chumbawamba member throwing a bucket of iced water over then-Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott. These moments took place in the 1990s when the ceremony had a reputation for being \"a little shambolic, unpredictable and, at times, anarchic\" with a criticism it has lost its edge since then and \"evolved into a more polished, sanitised affair.\"\nThe BRIT Awards were broadcast live until 1989, when Samantha Fox and Mick Fleetwood hosted a widely criticised show in which little went as rehearsed. From 1990 to 2006, the event was recorded and broadcast the following night. From 2007, The BRIT Awards reverted to a live broadcast on British television, on 14 February on ITV. That year, comedian Russell Brand was the host and three awards were dropped from the ceremony: British Rock Act, British Urban Act and British Pop Act. For the last time, on 16 February 2010, Earls Court in London was the venue for The BRITs. The BRIT Awards were held at the O2 Arena in London for the first time in 2011.\nThe BRIT Award statuette given to the winners features Britannia, the female personification of Britain. Since 2011, the statuette has been regularly redesigned by well known British artists, architects, and designers including Vivienne Westwood, Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin, Peter Blake, Zaha Hadid, Anish Kapoor, David Adjaye, Yinka Ilori and Es Devlin, Pam Hogg, Olaolu Slawn and Rachel Jones. In 1992, KLF opened the show and invited extreme metal band Extreme Noise Terror on stage, complete with flame-throwers, and fired machine gun blanks over the crowd. The group sent a dead sheep to the aftershow party, and later buried their BRIT Award statuette at Stonehenge signifying their abhorrence of the music industry. Robbie Williams holds the record for the most BRIT Awards, 13 as a solo artist and another five as part of Take That. Girl group Little Mix made history at the Brit Awards 2021, when they became the first female group to receive the award at the ceremony after 43 years since it was first introduced. In 2024, English singer-songwriter Raye, broke the record for the most nominations received by a single artist in a year with seven in total.", "hasanswer": true}]}

They originated and acquired the \"Hugo\" nickname during the 1950s and were formally defined as a convention responsibility under the name \"Science Fiction Achievement Awards\" early in the 1960s. The nickname soon became almost universal and its use legally protected; \"Hugo Award(s)\" replaced the longer name in all official uses after the 1991 cycle.In 1960 Gernsback received a special Hugo Award as \"The Father of Magazine Science Fiction\".The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted him in 1996, its inaugural class of two deceased and two living persons.Science fiction author Brian W. Aldiss held a contrary view about Gernsback's contributions: \"It is easy to argue that Hugo Gernsback ... was one of the worst disasters to hit the science fiction field ... Gernsback himself was utterly without any literary understanding. He created dangerous precedents which many later editors in the field followed.\"Gernsback made significant contributions to the growth of early broadcasting, mostly through his efforts as a publisher. He originated the industry of specialized publications for radio with Modern Electrics and Electrical Experimenter. Later on, and more influentially, he published Radio News, which would have the largest readership among radio magazines in radio broadcasting's formative years. He edited Radio News until 1929. For a short time he hired John F. Rider to be editor. Rider was a former engineer working with the US Army Signal Corps and a radio engineer for Alfred H. Grebe, a radio manufacturer. However, Rider would soon leave Gernsback and form his own publishing company, John F. Rider Publisher, New York around 1931.\nGernsback made use of the magazine to promote his interests, including having his radio station's call letters on the cover starting in 1925. WRNY and Radio News were used to cross-promote each other, with programs on his station often used to discuss articles he had published, and articles in the magazine often covering program activities at WRNY. He also advocated for future directions in innovation and regulation of radio. The magazine contained many drawings and diagrams, encouraging radio listeners of the 1920s to experiment themselves to improve the technology. WRNY was often used as a laboratory to see if various radio inventions were worthwhile.\nArticles that were published about television were also tested in this manner when the radio station was used to send pictures to experimental television receivers in August 1928. The technology, however, required sending sight and sound one after the other rather than sending both at the same time, as WRNY only broadcast on one channel. Such experiments were expensive, eventually contributing to Gernsback's Experimenter Publishing Company going into bankruptcy in 1929. WRNY was sold to Aviation Radio, who maintained the channel part-time to broadcast aviation weather reports and related feature programs. Along with other stations sharing the same frequency, it was acquired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and consolidated into that company's WHN in 1934.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It presently covers the majority of Quebec, all provincial capitals (though Regina, Victoria, Edmonton, St. John's, Fredericton and Charlottetown are only served by rebroadcasters) and other large cities such as Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver.\nThe network was rebranded as La cha\u00eene culturelle (\"The cultural network\") in 1997 and later as Espace musique in September 2004, the latter as part of a major repositioning of the CBC's French services. Many high-brow cultural programs were moved to Premi\u00e8re Cha\u00eene, while the new Espace musique service adopted a more populist approach focusing on four genres \u2013 classical, jazz, world, and folk music \u2013 and French-language song.\n\n For about two weeks in late August / early September 2004 leading up to the Espace musique relaunch, the network did not have any name, at least officially. The network \"stunted\" with a continuous stream of classical music and jazz, aside from hourly newscasts simulcast from Premi\u00e8re Cha\u00eene and regular reminders that la Cha\u00eene culturelle had shut down and (later) that it would relaunch as Espace musique on September 7.\nThe rebranding was controversial. The network's previous format, largely classical music, had been similar to that of CBC Radio Two, and was indeed regarded by some as superior to its English-language counterpart, leading many cultural commentators to criticize the new format. However, Bureau of Broadcast Measurement ratings taken soon after the relaunch  suggested that the service has indeed become more popular.\n\nUnlike most CBC broadcast networks, from its inception until fall 2010, all ICI Musique transmitters aired the same programming simultaneously on all stations regardless of location, except for (from 2004 to 2010) two weekday evening programs that were interchanged on the British Columbia transmitters.\nSince September 2010, the network has adopted the practice of the CBC's other French-language networks, whereby network programs are broadcast live in the Eastern, Atlantic, and Newfoundland time zones, then aired on tape delay (at the same local times as in the Eastern time zone) in Western Canada. At the same time the network devolved responsibility for the 8:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. (9:30-1:00 AT; formerly from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. / 10:00-4:00 AT) time slot to regional stations. Separate daytime programs were slated to be produced by each of the network's originating stations - the exceptions having been CBAX-FM Halifax, which carried programming produced at CBAL-FM Moncton; and CBCX-FM Calgary / Edmonton, which carried regional programs from CKSB-FM Winnipeg.\nOn May 4, 2011, the network began transmitting on Sirius XM satellite radio channel 153 across North America.  \"Ici musique chansons\" was later moved to channel 163.\nOn June 5, 2013, it was announced that Espace musique would be re-branded as ICI Musique as part of a wider re-branding of the CBC's French-language outlets around the brand \"Ici\". The changes took effect on-air in June 2014, along with the re-branding of the network's website espace.mu as icimusique.ca.On April 10, 2014, further budget cuts were announced for the CBC/Radio-Canada, affecting also Espace Musique, whose regional programming (namely Beau temps, mauvais temps on weekday mornings) was cancelled on June 20.

The concept of a separate Grammy Awards for Latin music began in 1989. According to organizers, the Latin Grammy Awards was established as the Latin music universe was deemed too large to fit on the Grammy Awards. The Latin Recording Academy defines Latin music as music in Spanish or Portuguese. The Latin Grammy Awards mainly encompasses music released in Latin America, Spain, Portugal and the Latino United States. In 2000, it was announced that the 1st Annual Latin Grammy Awards would take place at the Staples Center on September 13, 2000. On July 7, 2000, the nominations were announced in Miami, Florida, United States. The Latin Grammys were introduced with over 39 categories included limited to Spanish and Portuguese-speaking recordings. The first telecast took place at the Staples Center and was broadcast. The following year's show was canceled due to the September 11, 2001 attacks, which was the same day the show was to take place. In 2002, the academy elected its first independent board of trustees. In 2005, the broadcast was moved from CBS to Univision where the whole telecast was in Spanish.Voting members live in various regions in the US and outside of the US including Latin America and Iberia. For a recording to be eligible for a nomination, it must have at least 60% (previously 51% until 2024) of its content recorded in Spanish or Portuguese and commercially released in North America, Central America, South America, the Caribbean, Spain, or Portugal. Products recorded in languages and dialects from Ibero-America such as Catalan, Basque, Galician, Valencian, Nahuatl, Guarani, Quechua or Mayan may be accepted by majority vote of the committees of the Latin Recording Academy. The Latin Recording Academy also accepts Latin instrumental music from Ibero-America as well as compositions that have been composed or interpreted by an Iberian American musician. The eligibility period is June 1 to May 30 for a respective awards ceremony. Recordings are first entered and then reviewed to determine the awards they are eligible for. Following that, nominating ballots are mailed to voting members of the academy. The votes are tabulated and the five recordings in each category with the most votes become the nominees. Final voting ballots are sent out to voting members and the winners are determined. Winners are later announced at the Latin Grammy Awards. The current President & CEO of the Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences is Manuel Abud, who succeeded Gabriel Abaroa in 2021.Altogether there are three events: the Life Achievement when renowned artists are honored for lifetime achievement; Person of the Year, when one artist is honored at a gala dinner, and Grammy itself, an award that brings together artists from all over Latin America and Iberia and that today is broadcast live to 80 countries, including Brazil, by channel Univision (TNT in Brazil).", "hasanswer": false}]}

But after what an email to members called \"an unprecedented cry out\" from its membership, the BFCA's board of directors called a \"special referendum\" on adding the movie to the ten candidates for Best Picture, which it won. (A similar situation happened for the 6th Critics' Choice Awards in 2001, in which the film Cast Away was voted by referendum to be included among the nominees for Best Picture.) The BFCA faced immediate criticism, including from its own members, over what many saw as an attempt to increase ratings for the awards ceremony's broadcast on A&E (which, is 50% owned by Disney, the company behind Star Wars) on January 17, 2016. Two members\u2014Eric Melin (editor-in-chief of Scene-Stealers.com, a film critic of Lawrence Journal-World, and the president of the Kansas City Film Critics Circle) and Scott Renshaw (editor of Salt Lake City Weekly)\u2014resigned in protest.\n\nMelin, in an open letter, wrote: \"In order for a professional critics body to have integrity, nomination and voting guidelines must be consistent with the way they were laid out at the beginning of the process. Nominating Star Wars: The Force Awakens for Best Picture does not follow those guidelines, and re-ignites a loophole for this kind of thing to happen every year... Unlike the other nominations, this was not decided upon using a weighted ballot of all possibilities, and it smells like a desperate ploy to get better TV ratings. Additionally, your insistence on billing the Critic's Choice Awards as the 'most accurate predictor of the Academy Awards' is antithetical to the purpose of having a 'critic's choice' award at all. The awards should not serve as another TV marketing arm to the studios. Rather, it should represent the views and opinions of film critics, which is a very different group from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. As film criticism continues to be devalued and the lines between journalist, critic, and studio shill continue to be blurred, the only thing we have is our integrity, and this smacks of a marketing ploy. Believe me, I know because my day job is a social media marketer. What I am not is an employee of A&E Networks, and the only thing I have as a lowly paid film critic is the courage of my convictions.\"\nSimilarly, in another open letter, Renshaw wrote: \"This decision has been a long time coming, but was made inevitable by the decision to change the voting process to allow Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens to be included as a nominee after the official nominating deadline. Irrespective of any precedent that may be invoked... it is obvious to me that this decision is based more on its marketing value than making sure that the best films are included. If that were the case, the entire nomination process would have been opened up again to allow The Force Awakens to be considered in all categories. Any suggestion that this decision was made primarily for any reason other than to improve ratings for the awards broadcast feels disingenuous at best. An awards voting body has nothing to stand on but its integrity. I no longer feel my own personal integrity is consistent with ongoing membership in this organization.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 2000, it was announced that the 1st Annual Latin Grammy Awards would take place at the Staples Center on September 13, 2000. On July 7, 2000, the nominations were announced in Miami, Florida, United States.

The following year's show was canceled due to the September 11, 2001 attacks, which was the same day the show was to take place. In 2002, the academy elected its first independent board of trustees. In 2005, the broadcast was moved from CBS to Univision where the whole telecast was in Spanish.Voting members live in various regions in the US and outside of the US including Latin America and Iberia. For a recording to be eligible for a nomination, it must have at least 60% (previously 51% until 2024) of its content recorded in Spanish or Portuguese and commercially released in North America, Central America, South America, the Caribbean, Spain, or Portugal.

The Latin Recording Academy also accepts Latin instrumental music from Ibero-America as well as compositions that have been composed or interpreted by an Iberian American musician. The eligibility period is June 1 to May 30 for a respective awards ceremony. Recordings are first entered and then reviewed to determine the awards they are eligible for. Following that, nominating ballots are mailed to voting members of the academy. The votes are tabulated and the five recordings in each category with the most votes become the nominees. Final voting ballots are sent out to voting members and the winners are determined. Winners are later announced at the Latin Grammy Awards.

But after what an email to members called \"an unprecedented cry out\" from its membership, the BFCA's board of directors called a \"special referendum\" on adding the movie to the ten candidates for Best Picture, which it won. (A similar situation happened for the 6th Critics' Choice Awards in 2001, in which the film Cast Away was voted by referendum to be included among the nominees for Best Picture.) The BFCA faced immediate criticism, including from its own members, over what many saw as an attempt to increase ratings for the awards ceremony's broadcast on A&E (which, is 50% owned by Disney, the company behind Star Wars) on January 17, 2016. Two members\u2014Eric Melin (editor-in-chief of Scene-Stealers.com, a film critic of Lawrence Journal-World, and the president of the Kansas City Film Critics Circle) and Scott Renshaw (editor of Salt Lake City Weekly)\u2014resigned in protest.\n\nMelin, in an open letter, wrote: \"In order for a professional critics body to have integrity, nomination and voting guidelines must be consistent with the way they were laid out at the beginning of the process. Nominating Star Wars: The Force Awakens for Best Picture does not follow those guidelines, and re-ignites a loophole for this kind of thing to happen every year... Unlike the other nominations, this was not decided upon using a weighted ballot of all possibilities, and it smells like a desperate ploy to get better TV ratings. Additionally, your insistence on billing the Critic's Choice Awards as the 'most accurate predictor of the Academy Awards' is antithetical to the purpose of having a 'critic's choice' award at all. The awards should not serve as another TV marketing arm to the studios. Rather, it should represent the views and opinions of film critics, which is a very different group from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. As film criticism continues to be devalued and the lines between journalist, critic, and studio shill continue to be blurred, the only thing we have is our integrity, and this smacks of a marketing ploy. Believe me, I know because my day job is a social media marketer. What I am not is an employee of A&E Networks, and the only thing I have as a lowly paid film critic is the courage of my convictions.\"\nSimilarly, in another open letter, Renshaw wrote: \"This decision has been a long time coming, but was made inevitable by the decision to change the voting process to allow Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens to be included as a nominee after the official nominating deadline. Irrespective of any precedent that may be invoked... it is obvious to me that this decision is based more on its marketing value than making sure that the best films are included. If that were the case, the entire nomination process would have been opened up again to allow The Force Awakens to be considered in all categories. Any suggestion that this decision was made primarily for any reason other than to improve ratings for the awards broadcast feels disingenuous at best. An awards voting body has nothing to stand on but its integrity. I no longer feel my own personal integrity is consistent with ongoing membership in this organization.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Other games not broadcast by WGN-TV are aired on regional sports network NBC Sports Chicago, the first time in at least 35 years that non-nationally broadcast home games were seen locally, either over-the-air or on cable. On February 15, 2011, it was announced that the team had renewed their broadcast contract with WGN-TV for the next five years, starting in the 2011\u201312 NHL season.

{"id": "3301_212", "question": "What channel broadcast Occasional Wife?", "ctxs": [{"id": "452_22580", "text": "CMLL regularly runs seven shows on five days in a week. The biggest weekly show is the Friday night Super Viernes (\"Super Friday\") show, held in the famous Arena Mexico in Mexico City. CMLL runs also shows on Saturdays in Arena Coliseo, on Sundays in Arena Mexico and Arena Coliseo Guadalajara, on Mondays in Arena Puebla, and on Tuesdays in Arena Mexico and Arena Coliseo Guadalajara. The Friday and Tuesday shows are also televised.Of all the major professional wrestling promotions in the world, CMLL is one of the most conservative, having earned the nickname \"The serious and the stable\" (La Seria y Estable) over time. Matches with blood are not broadcast unless it accidentally happens during a live event. CMLL rarely uses specialty or \"gimmick matches\" outside a limited number of steel cage matches and the occasional Super Libre, no-disqualification matches. While other promotions have adopted matches such as the ladder match, CMLL remains much more traditional. They also have strict rules for what they will allow to happen during their shows; on one occasion a match between Dr. Wagner Jr. and L. A. Park during the CMLL 75th Anniversary Show degenerated into a brawl on the floor that was so out of control that both wrestlers were fired by CMLL a short time later. CMLL also has strict rules on what wrestlers can and cannot say during their shows, a rule illustrated in 2015 where L.A. Park was fired from the promotion only three weeks after returning due to a profanity-laden rant during a CMLL show.CMLL's main programming, hosted by Alfonso Morales, Leobardo Magadan and Miguel Linares, is broadcast regularly on Televisa in Mexico, on LATV in the United States, and formerly on Telelatino in Canada and The Wrestling Channel in the United Kingdom. CMLL also had a syndicated show called \"Sin Limite de Tiempo\" (\"with no time limit\") which shows matches from Arena Coliseo shows and matches they could not fit onto the regular broadcast. It aired in Los Angeles on KWHY and Also Air in San Francisco on KEMO-TV. This show was followed up by \"Guerreros del Ring\" on Canal 52MX. Also, Spanish-language American sports channel Fox Sports en Espa\u00f1ol recently started broadcasting CMLL programming. Recently CMLL also added the Mexican network Cadena Tres to its list of networks airing CMLL Wrestling. Galavision began airing CMLL wrestling in the spring of 2011. Galavision shows only a one-hour version while LATV has shown a two-hour version. In 2015, several of CMLL's shows became available live on their YouTube channel and they have held a number of internet-Pay Per Views (PPVs).", "hasanswer": false}]}
