The series chronicles the adventures of the title character, Freakazoid, a crazy teenage superhero who fights crime in Washington, D.C. It also features mini-episodes about the adventures of other superheroes. The series was produced by Warner Bros. Animation and Amblin Television, being the third animated series produced through the collaboration of Steven Spielberg and Warner Bros. Animation after Tiny Toon Adventures and Animaniacs.\nBruce Timm, best known as a producer of the DC Animated Universe, originally intended for the series to be a straightforward superhero action-adventure cartoon with comic overtones, but executive producer Steven Spielberg requested it to be a flat-out comedy. The show is similar to fellow Ruegger-led programs such as Animaniacs, having a unique style of humor that includes slapstick, fourth wall breaking, parody, surreal humour, and pop culture references.\nThe series debuted on Kids' WB on September 9, 1995 alongside Animaniacs, The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries, and Pinky and the Brain. The series lasted for two seasons across 24 episodes, with the final episode being broadcast on June 1, 1997. Although the series originally struggled in ratings, reruns on Cartoon Network and a fan following elevated it to become a cult hit. Warner Bros. considered renewing the series for a third season, but deemed it to be too expensive. The show also ranked #53 on IGN's Top 100 Animated Series list.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Maddie is supported by Jackie, a motherly saltwater crocodile, who tells her and her three best friends \u2014Frank, a funnel-web spider, Zoe, a thorny devil, and Nigel, a marbled scorpion\u2014 about the Outback, a place recognizable with three mountains where creatures like them belong. One day, Jackie is removed from the zoo after she tries to save Chaz's son, Chazzie, from a moat; the staff and patrons believed she was trying to eat him. Saddened and in despair, Maddie decides to escape to the Outback with her companions to find a place where they can live happily. During their escape, Pretty Boy, a celebrity koala and the group's rival, tries to alert the park's security but is accidentally paralyzed by Nigel when the group try to stop him. The group reluctantly decide to take him with them, but not before he is caught on a security camera exhibiting mouth foam from his paralyzing.\nWhile crossing Sydney Harbour, they run into Jacinta, a great white shark, who is part of a mysterious organization called the Ugly Secret Society (USS) where animals considered \"monsters\" help each other upon hearing a password(\"I'm ugly, you're ugly, we should all be this ugly, ugly is the new beautiful\"). When they reach Circular Quay, Pretty Boy tries to get the attention of the city for rescue but finds that the world misbelieves he has rabies after seeing the footage and he ends getting chased by an angry mob, which corner him, Maddie, and her friends, but Maddie helps them narrowly escape by saying the USS password, sending the group into the sewers. After getting help from Legs, a Redback Spider and her pack in getting around the sewers, Pretty Boy finds that he is incorrectly reported dead and his popularity has been taken by a quokka named Giggles. Chaz and Chazzie find the group and attempt to tranquilize them, but they escape via an ice cream truck.\nAt a school in the outer suburbs, after Maddie frees two lovelorn cane toads named Doug and Doreen, the animals get a ride on an excursion bus that takes them to the Blue Mountains. Chaz and Chazzie catch up and the animals get in the bus to hide, but inadvertently cause the bus to be pulled over, allowing Chaz to enter to search the vehicle for them but an Aboriginal girl named Norine allows them to escape. However, Chaz throws Pretty Boy out a window and Frank accidentally sends himself, Maddie, Zoe, and Nigel falling off a cliff, landing on a unconscious Pretty Boy in the process. \nMaddie argues with Pretty Boy, who berates her for ruining his popularity and breaks down, but when Maddie tries to comfort him, he bursts into a fit of laughter. At that moment however, Chaz falls off the same cliff as the group did and lands on Maddie, Frank, Zoe, and Nigel, who end up getting all over his face, causing Chaz to panic and he throws them off his face but, in doing so, unknowingly pins Maddie to the ground with a stick. Horrified, Frank, Zoe, and Nigel try to save her, but they fall into a pit that Chaz seals off. Having assumed that Chaz had been trying to rescue him, Pretty Boy gleefully approaches Chaz for him to take him home, but he kicks him away and prepares to sedate Maddie. Feeling betrayed, Pretty Boy says the USS password, which alerts some Tasmanian devils, Dave, Lucifer, and Beelzebub, to their presence. After the animals escape, Chaz reveals to Chazzie that his adventurous and Aussie wildlife expert history was all a lie and he only moved from Florida to Australia after being inspired by television shows featuring Australian zookeepers. He decides to make it up to Chazzie by really going after the animals and bringing them back to the park, though Chazzie is no longer sure about the mission.\nOver the next few days, the animals are helped by many creatures of the USS (which include Clive, a dung beetle, Vlad, a bat, Susan and Deirdre, two Razorbacks, and Phil, a platypus) on their way to the Outback, while Pretty Boy bonds more with the creatures. One night, Maddie sings a lullaby that she had sung at the park ago & was her only memory of her mother: she was washed out of the nest as an egg by a flood and after a perilous journey, was found on the road by Chaz. Pretty Boy reveals that he was also orphaned, with his mother being killed by a moving car. The next day, Pretty Boy finds a tree of koalas, led by a female koala named Skylar, and foolishly leaves the other creatures, to their dismay and Maddie's relief.\nMaddie and the others reach the three mountains. Not long after they arrive, Chaz, with the help of a biker gang from a pub, rounds up and captures Frank, Zoe, and Nigel. Chazzie runs into Maddie and is initially scared of her, but warms up to her upon seeing that she is just as scared as he is of her. Chaz, having misinterpreted Chazzie's encounter with Maddie as catching her, captures Maddie as well and places the creatures in boxes in the back of his jeep, but Chazzie sets Maddie free without his father looking but makes no effort in freeing her friends. \nMaddie, who broke down crying over losing her friends, tries to get the animals of the land to help her rescue them, but they initially refuse due to the fact none of them had ever left before. However, Pretty Boy, having found life with the other koalas not as great as he thought due to Skylar being overly chatty and shallow, returns. He cheers her up and asks her to go to the rescue. Using a fire truck, they catch up to the truck and try to break them out. The rescue becomes a disaster when Pretty unmounts the truck to help Maddie, causing the ladder to spin uncontrollably just as Maddie accepts her friends as her adopted siblings, resulting in Zoe taking advantage of Nigel's fear of the color beige to make him emit a high pitch screech to break the glass, which even Zoe believed was unbreakable due a sticker meant to discourage humans from breaking it. \nUsing one of bikers bikes, Maddie and Pretty reunite with their friends and are chased into a canyon, where the Outback inhabitants, having changed their minds about not helping Maddie, and even the other koalas arrive to help, but everyone is caught in a trap sprung by Clive as a way to get revenge on Chaz for the loss of his brother Duncan, who, prior to the events of the film, tried to escape but ended up getting eaten by a seagull. As a result, they reach a cliff where Chazzie is left dangling over the edge on the ladder. While trying to save Chazzie, Maddie finally stands up to Chaz and tells him that, despite being the dangerous snake on the planet, she is not the monster he says she is and bites his wrist band to help Pretty Boy pull Chazzie to safety. As Maddie is revealed to have molted afterwards, Chaz fully sees these creatures as heroes and decides to let them return to the wild.\nAs the Outback inhabitants celebrate the group's heroism, they reunite with Doug and Doreen, who now have numerous children which swarm Pretty Boy, and Jackie, who is revealed to be the head of the USS and had escaped by knowing a few tricks to do so & then ordered the USS that she had founded during her lifetime to help the group on their journey, and they all join their new life in the Outback.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was also the first adult animated series produced by Nelvana, predating Bob and Margaret.\nDelayed for years and panned by critics, the show is considered one of the worst animated television series of all time; one critic called it \"one of the biggest fiascos in television animation history, on both a creative and commercial level, in spite (but, in many ways, because) of the high-powered talent behind the project\". One critic observed that the main problem with the show was that \"the Binsford family was so repulsively selfish to the main protagonist that audience interest in their adventures was nil\".", "hasanswer": true}]}
{"id": "1431_17", "question": "Who was the executive producer of When We Rise?", "ctxs": [{"id": "674_53837", "text": "In 2001, soon after the original Shrek proved to be a hit, Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz negotiated an upfront payment of $10 million each for voicing a sequel to the film. This pay increase represented a significant rise from the $350,000 salary that each of the three were paid for the first film. According to Jeffrey Katzenberg, the executive producer of Shrek 2 and a co-founder of DreamWorks Pictures, who led the negotiations, the payments were probably the highest in the actors' entire careers. Each of the actors were expected to work between 15 and 18 hours in total. The film was produced with a $70 million budget.Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, the screenwriters of the first Shrek film, insisted that the sequel be a traditional fairytale, but after disagreements with the producers, they left the project and were replaced by director Andrew Adamson. His writing of Shrek 2 was inspired by the 1967 comedy-drama film Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, and was completed with the help of the film's co-writers Joe Stillman (one of the other writers from the first film), J. David Stem and David N. Weiss, and co-directors, Kelly Asbury and Conrad Vernon, whom the latter two spent most of the film's production duration in Northern California while Adamson spent most of his time with the film's voice actors in Glendale, California.DreamWorks began production of Shrek 2 in 2001, before the first Shrek film was completed. The studio added more human characters to the film than there were in its predecessor and improved character appearance and movement with the use of several new animation/rendering systems. In particular, Puss in Boots necessitated development of a whole new set of film production tools to handle the appearance of his fur, belt, and hat plume; Puss' fur especially required an upgrade to the fur shader. All of the character setup was completed in the first three years of production.In an early version of Shrek 2, Shrek abdicated the throne, and called for a fairy tale election. Pinocchio's campaign was an \"honesty\" campaign, while Gingy's was a \"smear\" campaign. Adamson said that although this plot did have many funny ideas, it was also too overtly satiric and political, and considered \"more intellectual than emotional\". Shrek 2 also appears much darker in terms of lighting when compared to the original film. Designers reportedly took inspiration from 19th century French illustrator and engraver Gustav Dor\u00e9 to improve the film's richness of detail and setting. According to production designer Guillaume Aretos, \"There are a lot of medieval paintings and illustrations [and] my own influences, which are classical paintings from the 15th and 16th centuries...The design of Shrek is always a twist on reality anyway, so we tried to [pack] as much detail and interest as we could in the imagery.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The series chronicles the adventures of the title character, Freakazoid, a crazy teenage superhero who fights crime in Washington, D.C. It also features mini-episodes about the adventures of other superheroes. The series was produced by Warner Bros. Animation and Amblin Television, being the third animated series produced through the collaboration of Steven Spielberg and Warner Bros. Animation after Tiny Toon Adventures and Animaniacs.\nBruce Timm, best known as a producer of the DC Animated Universe, originally intended for the series to be a straightforward superhero action-adventure cartoon with comic overtones, but executive producer Steven Spielberg requested it to be a flat-out comedy.

{"id": "1431_26", "question": "Who was the executive producer of The X-Files?", "ctxs": [{"id": "136_38204", "text": "The X-Files is an American science fiction drama television series created by Chris Carter.  The original television series aired from September 1993 to May 2002 on Fox. During its original run, the program spanned nine seasons, with 202 episodes. A short tenth season consisting of six episodes ran from January to February 2016. Following the ratings success of this revival, The X-Files returned for an eleventh season of ten episodes, which ran from January to March 2018. In addition to the television series, two feature films have been released: The 1998 film The X-Files and the stand-alone film The X-Files: I Want to Believe, released in 2008, six years after the original television run had ended.\nThe series revolves around Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who investigate the eponymous \"X-Files\": marginalized, unsolved cases involving paranormal phenomena. Mulder is a skilled criminal profiler, an ardent supernaturalist, and a conspiracy theorist who believes in the existence of the paranormal, whereas Scully is a medical doctor and a skeptic who has been assigned to scientifically analyze Mulder's discoveries. Early in the series, both agents become pawns in a larger conflict and come to trust only each other and a few select people. The agents also discover an agenda of the government to keep secret the existence of extraterrestrial life. Mulder and Scully's shared adventures lead them to develop a close platonic bond, which by series' end develops into a romantic relationship. Roughly one third of the series' episodes follow a complex mythopoeia-driven story arc about a planned alien invasion, whereas the other two-thirds are \"monster of the week\" episodes that each focus on a one-off villain, mutant, or monster.\nThe X-Files was inspired by earlier television series which featured elements of suspense and speculative fiction, including The Twilight Zone, Night Gallery, Tales from the Darkside, Twin Peaks, and especially Kolchak: The Night Stalker. When creating the main characters, Carter sought to reverse gender stereotypes by making Mulder a believer and Scully a skeptic. The first seven seasons featured Duchovny and Anderson equally. In the eighth and ninth seasons, Anderson took precedence while Duchovny appeared intermittently. New main characters were introduced: FBI Special Agents John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish). Mulder and Scully's boss, Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), also became a main character. The first five seasons of The X-Files were filmed and produced in Vancouver, British Columbia, before production eventually moved to Los Angeles to accommodate Duchovny. The series later returned to Vancouver to film The X-Files: I Want to Believe as well as the tenth and eleventh seasons.\nThe X-Files was a hit for the Fox network and received largely positive reviews, although its long-term story arc was criticized near the conclusion. Initially considered a cult series, it turned into a pop culture touchstone that tapped into public mistrust of governments and large institutions and embraced conspiracy theories and spirituality. Both the series itself and lead actors Duchovny and Anderson received multiple awards and nominations, and by its conclusion the show was the longest-running science fiction series in U.S. television history. The series also spawned a franchise that includes Millennium and The Lone Gunmen spin-offs, two theatrical films, and accompanying merchandise.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She was one of the first female executives in American television. Her appointment was called \"one of the most important television developments of the decade.\" She assembled a team of producers, all of whom had previously worked on Captain Kangaroo. Jon Stone was responsible for writing, casting, and format; Dave Connell took over animation; and Sam Gibbon served as the show's chief liaison between the production staff and the research team. Cameraman Frankie Biondo has worked on Sesame Street from its first episode in 1969.Jim Henson and the Muppets' involvement in Sesame Street began when he and Cooney met at one of the curriculum planning seminars in Boston. Author Christopher Finch reported that Stone, who had worked with Henson previously, felt that if they could not bring him on board, they should \"make do without puppets.\" Henson was initially reluctant, but he agreed to join Sesame Street to meet his own social goals. He also agreed to waive his performance fee for full ownership of the Sesame Street Muppets and to split any revenue they generated with the CTW. As Morrow stated, Henson's puppets were a crucial part of the show's popularity and it brought Henson national attention. Davis reported that Henson was able to take \"arcane academic goals\" and translate them to \"effective and pleasurable viewing.\" In early research, the Muppet segments of the show scored high, and more Muppets were added during the first few seasons. Morrow reported that the Muppets were effective teaching tools because children easily recognized them, they were stereotypical and predictable, and they appealed to adults and older siblings.\n\nAlthough the producers decided against depending upon a single host for Sesame Street, instead casting a group of ethnically diverse actors, they realized that a children's television program needed to have, as Lesser put it, \"a variety of distinctive and reliable personalities,\" both human and Muppet. Jon Stone, whose goal was to cast white actors in the minority, was responsible for hiring the show's first cast. He did not audition actors until Spring 1969, a few weeks before the five test shows were due to be filmed. Stone videotaped the auditions, and Ed Palmer took them out into the field to test children's reactions. The actors who received the \"most enthusiastic thumbs up\" were cast. For example, Loretta Long was chosen to play Susan when the children who saw her audition stood up and sang along with her rendition of \"I'm a Little Teapot.\" Stone stated that casting was the only aspect of the show that was \"just completely haphazard.\" Most of the cast and crew found jobs on Sesame Street through personal relationships with Stone and the other producers. According to puppeteer Marty Robinson in 2019, longevity was common among the show's cast and crew.According to the CTW's research, children preferred watching and listening to other children more than to puppets and adults, so they included children in many scenes. Dave Connell insisted that no child actors be used, so these children were non-professionals, unscripted, and spontaneous. Many of their reactions were unpredictable and difficult to control, but the adult cast learned to handle the children's spontaneity flexibly, even when it resulted in departures from the planned script or lesson. CTW research also revealed that the children's hesitations and on-air mistakes served as models for viewers. According to Morrow, this resulted in the show having a \"fresh quality,\" especially in its early years.", "hasanswer": false}]}

One such singer, Joe Stampley, agreed to produce a session for Traywick in Nashville. Hatcher paid $10,000 for the recording session and promotion, which was done through a small independent label based out of Shreveport, Louisiana, called Paula Records. The session accounted for the singles \"She's My Woman\" and \"I'll Take Any Willing Woman\". Traywick and Hatcher distributed copies of the single to radio stations throughout the Southern United States in 1979, which resulted in the former making number 91 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts. After the failure of these singles, Hatcher and Traywick continued submitting demo recordings to executives but were unable to garner interest at first. In 1981, Traywick and Hatcher chose to move to Nashville to put themselves closer to the center of the country music industry. Despite this, they would still travel back to Charlotte on weekends to tend to business at Country City USA, which by that point had relocated to a larger building. They supported themselves by renting out part of their Nashville house to songwriter Keith Stegall, who used it as an office. Stegall then introduced the two to song publisher and disc jockey Charlie Monk at a golf game, which led to him performing songs for Monk. Stegall also submitted Traywick's demos to various Nashville producers to garner interest in a recording contract. Traywick recorded one session with producer John Ragsdale for the intent of signing him to Curb Records, but the label ultimately chose not to sign him.In 1982, Hatcher got a job managing a nightclub called the Nashville Palace through the recommendation of singer Ray Pillow. She initially hired Traywick to wash dishes, but soon began to have him perform there as well. By this point, the two had begun crediting the singer as Randy Ray, as they thought the name was easier to pronounce than \"Traywick\". Hatcher also rented her in-house office space out to other industry executives, including staff of Radio & Records magazine; meanwhile, Randy Ray continued to work on his songwriting under Stegall's mentorship. By the end of the year, Hatcher and Nashville Palace owner John Hobbs financed an independent album titled Randy Ray Live at the Nashville Palace, which consisted of ten songs recorded by him at the Palace. Stegall served as producer on this project. He also auditioned on You Can Be a Star, a talent show on the former Nashville Network (TNN), in early 1983 and placed second behind Lang Scott (then-future husband of Linda Davis). Ralph Emery also invited him to perform several times on the TNN talk show Nashville Now, which he hosted.Despite the exposure from Nashville Now, he still failed to secure a recording contract throughout 1984. Martha Sharp, then working in artists and repertoire (A&R) at Warner Bros. Records's Nashville division, attended a seminar in late 1984 where executives suggested signing attractive young artists with a \"traditional\" sound. Through mutual contacts with Monk and Stegall, she became aware of Randy Ray, who at the time was working on more songs with the latter. Sharp arranged for him to be signed to a contract initially consisting of four songs. Executives disliked the name \"Randy Ray\" as they thought it sounded \"podunk\", and thus Sharp suggested \"Randy Travis\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Adolf Hitler commissioned the film and served as an unofficial executive producer; his name appears in the opening titles. It chronicles the 1934 Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg, which was attended by more than 700,000 Nazi supporters. The film contains excerpts of speeches given by Nazi leaders at the Congress, including Hitler, Rudolf Hess and Julius Streicher, interspersed with footage of massed Sturmabteilung (SA) and Schutzstaffel (SS) troops and public reaction. Its overriding theme is the return of Germany as a great power with Hitler as its leader. The film was produced after the Night of the Long Knives, and many formerly prominent SA members are absent.\nFollowing its release in March 1935, it became a major example of film used as propaganda and was well-received at home. Riefenstahl's techniques\u2014such as moving cameras, aerial photography, the use of long-focus lenses to create a distorted perspective, and the revolutionary approach to the use of music and cinematography\u2014have earned Triumph of the Will recognition as one of the greatest propaganda films in history. It won several awards in Germany, France and Italy.During World War II, Frank Capra's seven-film series Why We Fight was directly inspired by Triumph of the Will and the United States' response to it. In present-day Germany, the film is not censored but the courts commonly classify it as Nazi propaganda, which requires an educational context for public screenings.

Anderson, and written by Michael Arndt, while Unkrich wrote the story along with John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton, respectively, director and co-writer of the first two films.

Jim Varney, who voiced Slinky Dog in the first two films, died in 2000, 10 years before the release of the third film, so the role of Slinky was passed down to Blake Clark. The returning cast is joined by Ned Beatty, Michael Keaton, Whoopi Goldberg, Timothy Dalton, Kristen Schaal, Bonnie Hunt, and Jeff Garlin, who voice the new characters introduced in this film.

The script was developed in multiple versions; however, after Disney bought Pixar in early 2006, the Circle Seven version of the film was cancelled as the result of Circle Seven's closure. The production was then transferred to Pixar, where a new script was developed. Randy Newman returned to compose the film's musical score. With a budget of $200 million, Toy Story 3 is one of the most expensive films of all time.\nToy Story 3 premiered at the Taormina Film Fest in Italy on June 12, 2010, and was released in the United States on June 18. It was the first film to be released theatrically with Dolby Surround 7.1 sound. Like its predecessors, Toy Story 3 received critical acclaim upon release, with critics praising the vocal performances, screenplay, emotional depth, animation, and Newman's musical score. The film earned $1.067 billion worldwide, finishing its theatrical run as the highest-grossing film of 2010. It is also the first animated film to reach $1 billion at the box-office, and was the highest-grossing animated film of all time until the release of Frozen in 2013 and was Pixar's highest-grossing film until the release of Incredibles 2 in 2018. The National Board of Review and the American Film Institute named Toy Story 3 one of the top-ten films of 2010.

Episodes of Everybody Loves Raymond are emotionally dynamic presentations of otherwise prosaic premises typical for traditional sitcoms.SUNY Press' book The Sitcom Reader (2016) analyzed Raymond was part of a trend in 1990s television of family sitcoms geared towards older audiences, which resulted in the scripts not focusing so much on the child characters and being entirely about grown-ups bickering at each other. While the second season was in production, Romano expressed the challenge of having to write \"weird\" adult humor within \"parameters\" of a show about a family: \"I want to write a show where I have anxiety attacks, and we're all very concerned about that. Can the star of the show be a father who has anxiety attacks and flips out? Will that sit well with people?\" This involved trying to keep the presence of the child characters as little as possible: \"To be upstaged by toddlers? I get enough of that at home.\" As Romano described the stand-up material the show is based on upon the show's first season airing, \"I don't want to be a spokesman for family values, but that's the way my standup is perceived. My character is a father who loves his family but who would also love a little freedom.\" Explained TV critic Jones Ostrow, Raymond \"explored the tortuous/loving relationships of parents and adult children, of couples, of siblings and the Peter Pan syndrome that attaches to baby boomer males, sports nuts in particular.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Most of these shows were Hanna-Barbera action cartoons such as Space Ghost, The Herculoids, and Birdman and the Galaxy Trio, and virtually all of them were canceled by 1969 because of pressure from the parent groups. Members of these watch groups served as advisers to Hanna-Barbera and other animation studios to ensure that new programs would be safe for children.\nFred Silverman, an executive for daytime programming at CBS, was then looking for a show that would both revitalize his Saturday-morning line and please the watch groups. The result was The Archie Show from Filmation, based on Bob Montana's teenage humor comic book Archie. Also successful were the musical numbers The Archies performed during each program (one of which, \"Sugar, Sugar\", was the most successful Billboard number-one hit of 1969). Eager to build upon this success, Silverman contacted producers William Hanna and Joseph Barbera about creating another show based on a teenage rock group, this time featuring teens who solved mysteries between gigs. Silverman envisioned the show as a cross between the popular I Love a Mystery radio serials of the 1940s and either the Archie characters or the popular early 1960s television series The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis.After attempting to develop his version of the show, called House of Mystery, Barbera, who developed and sold Hanna-Barbera shows while Hanna produced them, passed the task along to story writers Joe Ruby and Ken Spears, as well as artist/character designer Iwao Takamoto. Their treatment, based in part on The Archie Show, was titled Mysteries Five and featured five teenagers: Geoff, Mike, Kelly, Linda, and Linda's brother W.W., along with their bongo-playing dog, Too Much, who collectively formed the band Mysteries Five. When The Mysteries Five were not performing at gigs, they were out-solving spooky mysteries involving ghosts, zombies, and other supernatural creatures. Ruby and Spears were unable to decide whether Too Much would be a large cowardly dog or a small feisty one. When the former was chosen, Ruby and Spears wrote Too Much as a Great Dane but revised the dog character to a large sheepdog (similar to the Archies' sheepdog, Hot Dog) just before their presentation to Silverman, as Ruby feared the character would be too similar to the comic strip character Marmaduke. Silverman rejected their initial pitch, and after consulting with Barbera on next steps, got Barbera's permission to go ahead with Too Much being a Great Dane instead of a sheepdog.During the design phase, lead character designer Takamoto consulted a studio colleague who was a breeder of Great Danes. After learning the characteristics of a prize-winning Great Dane from her, Takamoto proceeded to break most of the rules and designed Too Much with overly bowed legs, a double chin, and a sloped back, among other abnormalities.Ruby and Spears' second pass at the show used Dobie Gillis as the template for the teenagers rather than Archie. The treatment retained the dog Too Much, while reducing the number of teenagers to four, removing the Mike character and retaining Geoff, Kelly, Linda, and W.W. As their personalities were modified, so were the characters' names: Geoff became \"Ronnie\"\u2014later renamed \"Fred\" (at Silverman's behest), Kelly became \"Daphne\", Linda \"Velma\", and W.W. \"Shaggy\". The teens were now based on four teenage characters from The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis: Dobie Gillis, Thalia Menninger, Zelda Gilroy and Maynard G. Krebs, respectively.The revised show was re-pitched to Silverman, who liked the material but, disliking the title Mysteries Five, decided to call the show Who's S-S-Scared? Silverman presented Who's S-S-Scared? to the CBS executives as the centerpiece for the upcoming 1969\u201370 season's Saturday-morning cartoon block. CBS president Frank Stanton felt that the presentation artwork was too scary for young viewers and, thinking the show would be the same, decided to pass on it.Now without a centerpiece for the upcoming season's programming, Silverman had Ruby, Spears, and the Hanna-Barbera staff revise the treatments and presentation materials to tone down the show and better reflect its comedy elements. The rock band element was dropped, and more attention was focused on Shaggy and Too Much. According to Ruby and Spears, Silverman was inspired by Frank Sinatra's scat \"doo-be-doo-be-doo\" at the end of his recording of \"Strangers in the Night\" on a red-eye flight to one of the development meetings, and decided to rename the dog \"Scooby-Doo\" and retitled the show Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!

This encouraged him to set up his own company, _Universalia_. He was one of the first to recognize the genius of Luchino Visconti, Roberto Rossellini and Vittorio De Sica, producing their early films (La Terra Trema (1948) for Visconti, _Germania anno zero (1947)_, for Rossellini, and _Porta del cielo, La (1946)_ for De Sica). Visconti's 'Terra Trema' screenplay was refused by all producers at the time, as they felt it would hardly be a box-office hit. Salvo d'Angelo was the only one who believed that Visconti (who had made at that point just one film) would make it a great movie that would eventually repay its cost. That proved to be true: the film was awarded the Silver Lion at the Venice International Film Festival and has been presented consistently in many countries in the past 54 years of its life (it was made in 1947). 'Terra trema' has been hailed one of the greatest art films of all time. D'Angelo was the first Italian producer starting co-productions with the French motion picture industry, and the result was Fabiola (1949) directed by Alessandro Blasetti and starring 'Mich\u00e8le Morgan', 'Henri Vidal' and 'Michel Simon', with a strong social and historical message. Next came Beauty and the Devil (1950) directed by the celebrated Ren\u00e9 Clair and starring G\u00e9rard Philipeand Michel Simon. The premi\u00e8re of this film took place at the Paris Opera House and was attended by the President of the Republic of France, Vincent Auriol.\nIn 1951 D'Angelo' proposed to Luchino Visconti to make a movie (Beautiful (1951)) with the greatest Italian star of the time, 'Anna Magnani', it was the story of a mother who wants at all costs her little daughter to win a competition for a role in a movie. Her illusions, even when her daughter is finally selected by the director (Alessandro Blasetti playing himself), will collapse when she discovers the harsh reality behind the glamor of motion pictures. Salvo d'Angelo was the first to believe in and help Franco Zeffirelli, Francesco Rosi (both were hired to be Visconti's assistants for 'Terra Trema' and 'Bellissima') and other directors and actors, like Vittorio Gassman, who later became world famous. He never produced his films by looking first and foremost at the box office, for his prime considerations were always quality and contents.\nHis mark as a producer of Italian motion pictures has been publicly recognized, among others, by Federico Fellini, Vittorio De Sica, Alessandro Blasetti, Roberto Rosselliniand Giorgio Strehler as well as by the press. His films are still part of the collections kept in many cine clubs both in Italy and abroad.\nMini Biography By his son: Bruno d'Angelo", "hasanswer": false}]}

Coppola took it further with The Godfather Part II, and the success of those two films, critically, artistically and financially, was a catalyst for the production of numerous other depictions of Italian Americans as mobsters, including films such as Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas and TV series such as David Chase's The Sopranos.\nA comprehensive study of Italian-American culture in film from 1914 to 2014 was conducted by the Italic Institute of America showing the influence of The Godfather. Over 81 percent of films, 430 films, featuring Italian Americans as mobsters (87 percent of which were fictional) had been produced since The Godfather, an average of 10 per year, while only 98 films were produced preceding The Godfather.\nThe Godfather epic, encompassing the original trilogy and the additional footage that Coppola incorporated later, has been thoroughly integrated into American life. Together with a succession of mob-theme imitators, it has resulted in a stereotyped concept of Italian-American culture biased toward the criminal networks. The first film had the largest effect. Unlike any film before it, its portrayal of the many poor Italians who immigrated to the United States in the early decades of the 20th century is perhaps attributable to Coppola and expresses his understanding of their experience. The films explore the integration of fictional Italian-American criminals into American society. Though set in the period of mass Italian immigration to America, the film explores the specific family of the Corleones, who live outside the law. Although some critics have considered the Corleone story to portray some universal elements of immigration, other critics have suggested that it resulted in viewers overly associating organized crime with Italian-American culture. Produced in a period of intense national cynicism and self-criticism, the film struck a chord about the dual identities felt by many descendants of immigrants. The Godfather has been cited as an influence in an increase in Hollywood's negative portrayals of immigrant Italians, and was a recruiting tool for organized crime.The concept of a mafia \"Godfather\" was a creation of Mario Puzo, and the film resulted in this term being added to the common language. Don Vito Corleone's line, \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse\", was voted the second-most memorable line in cinema history in AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes by the American Film Institute, in 2014. The concept was not unique to the film. French writer Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, in his novel Le P\u00e8re Goriot (1835), wrote that Vautrin told Eug\u00e8ne: \"In that case I will make you an offer that no one would decline.\" An almost identical line was used in the John Wayne Western, Riders of Destiny (1933), where Forrest Taylor states, \"I've made Denton an offer he can't refuse.\" In 2014, the film also was selected as the greatest film by 2,120 industry professionals in a Hollywood survey undertaken by The Hollywood Reporter.Gangsters reportedly responded enthusiastically to the film. Salvatore \"Sammy the Bull\" Gravano, the former underboss in the Gambino crime family, said: \"I left the movie stunned ... I mean I floated out of the theater. Maybe it was fiction, but for me, then, that was our life. It was incredible. I remember talking to a multitude of guys, made guys, who felt exactly the same way.\" According to Anthony Fiato, after seeing the film, Patriarca crime family members Paulie Intiso and Nicky Giso altered their speech patterns to imitate that of Vito Corleone. Intiso was known to swear frequently and use poor grammar; but after seeing the movie, he began to improve his speech and philosophize more.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was the first collaboration of producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, and the presentation of some sequences in the style of music videos was an influence on other 1980s films including Footloose, Purple Rain, and Top Gun, Simpson and Bruckheimer's most famous production. It was also one of Lyne's first major film releases, building on television commercials. Alex's elaborate dance sequences were shot using body doubles (Beals's main double was the uncredited French actress Marine Jahan, while a breakdance move was doubled by the male dancer Crazy Legs).The film opened to negative reviews by professional critics, including Roger Ebert, who panned it as \"great sound and flashdance, signifying nothing\" (and eventually placed it on his \"most hated\" list). It was a surprise box-office success, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 1983 in the United States. Its worldwide box-office gross exceeded $200 million. The soundtrack, compiled by Giorgio Moroder, spawned several hit songs, including \"Maniac\" (performed by Michael Sembello), and the Academy Award\u2013winning \"Flashdance... What a Feeling\", which was written for the film by Moroder, with lyrics by Keith Forsey and the singer Irene Cara. Flashdance is also often remembered for its film poster featuring Beals sporting a sweatshirt with a large neck hole (according to the actress, her look in the scene came about by accident after she simply cut a large hole at the top of one that had shrunk in the wash).", "hasanswer": true}]}

Although the Khalif has offered a reward for his capture, the roguish Sinbad ignores Omar's warnings and nonchalantly sneaks into the palace. Spouting Omar's poetry, Sinbad romances Nerissa, one of the Khalif's harem girls but is exposed by a slave.\nBoth Sinbad and Omar are caught and brought before the Khalif for sentencing. Also on trial are Greek scholar Simon Aristides, and his daughter Kristina, Sinbad's childhood friend, who has been wrongfully accused of stealing. After the Khalif orders that Sinbad and Omar be executed, his advisor, Jiddah, persuades him to meet with Murad, the ambassador to Tamerlane, a Tartar leader whose forces are threatening to invade Baghdad. Murad boldly informs the Khalif that the Tartars will soon be storming the city and demands that he and his men be entertained in the meantime.\nAnxious to save Kristina, Sinbad reveals to the Khalif that Simon possesses the formula for an explosive called \"Greek fire\" and will share it with the Khalif in exchange for Simon's, Kristina's, Omar's and his freedom. The Khalif refuses to release Sinbad and Omar, but while they are incarcerated in the dungeon, Simon and Kristina give the ruler a private demonstration of Greek fire.\nAs protection, Simon has entrusted the formula to Kristina, who can recite the instructions only while hypnotized. In front of the Khalif, Simon hypnotizes Kristina, who then gives her father directions for mixing the various bottled ingredients. Unknown to them, Jiddah is in cahoots with Murad, and both men are eavesdropping on the proceedings. Although Jiddah and Murad can hear Kristina telling her father how much of each item to use, they cannot ascertain the chemicals being poured by Simon.\nMeanwhile, the Khalif, ecstatic about the explosive, agrees to Simon's demand that Sinbad and Omar be freed in the morning. That night, Kristina confides in Ameer that she wants to marry Sinbad and asks her to tell him about his imminent release. Although jealous, Ameer delivers the message to Sinbad, but when she returns to Kristina's chambers, she finds Kristina gone and Simon murdered. Ameer sees Murad fleeing with Kristina and Simon's chemicals and sends a message via carrier pigeon before being caught by Jiddah.\nWhile torturing Ameer to reveal the bird's destination, Jiddah notices that she has a Forty Thieves tattoo on her shoulder. Although the Thieves, a band of raiders once led by Sinbad's father, are now dead, Ameer admits that their heirs have banded together, and Jiddah deduces that the message went to them. At dawn, Sinbad and Omar learn that their execution is to proceed as scheduled, but they escape the dungeon and fight their way to the Khalif's chambers. There, Sinbad offers to retrieve Kristina in exchange for his and Omar's freedom, some gold and a promise that he will be made second in command in Bagdad. The Khalif agrees and Sinbad rides off with Omar, unaware that Jiddah, having heard his exchange with the Khalif, is alerting Murad of his plan.\nLater, while resting in the desert, Sinbad and Omar are joined by Ameer, who reveals that Murad and his men are traveling in disguise with a caravan of merchants and that the Forty Thieves will attack them at first camp. Omar and Sinbad ride to the camp ahead of the caravan, and Sinbad has Omar bury him in the spot where he thinks Kristina's tent will be placed. Breathing through a reed, Sinbad remains buried in the Tartars' camp, far from Kristina's tent, until Murad unwittingly plucks his reed from the sand. Sinbad is forced to surface but manages to sneak into Kristina's tent and free her.\nAs Sinbad, Omar and Kristina ride off, the Forty Thieves, who are all women, attack the camp and reclaim Simon's bottles. Omar, Sinbad and Kristina then go to the Forty Thieves's cave and, using the cry \"open sesame,\" signals a donkey named Sesame to open the \"door.\" After arranging with Ghenia, the raiders' leader, Sinbad reunites with Ameer, but when he refuses to have \"eyes only for her,\" Ameer rejects him. Just then, Murad's men advance on the cave, and Sinbad quickly hypnotizes Kristina, who has fallen in love with Omar, and concocts some Greek fire using Simon's chemicals. Hurling torches coated with the explosive, the Thieves, Sinbad and Omar cripple Murad and his men. Sinbad then defeats Murad in a sword fight, and victory is declared. Later, Sinbad convinces the women to go with him to Bagdad and make peace with the Khalif. At the palace, the Khalif waits for Sinbad with Jiddah, whose duplicity he has yet to realize, preparing to execute him for failing his mission.\nWhen Sinbad appears with Kristina and a bevy of beautiful raiders, however, the Khalif embraces him and orders Jiddah to be de-tongued. At Sinbad's behest, Omar is made the royal poet, the Thieves are pardoned, and Sinbad is installed as second in command.

The reason for the rest was that Moffat felt their frequent appearances made them the \"most reliably defeatable enemies in the universe\". Moffat recalled that the Daleks were remembered for being scary, but due to their legacy as British icons they had become \"cuddly\" over the years and their true menace forgotten; with \"Asylum\" he intended to make them scary again, reminding the audience of their intentions. He thought the best way to do this would be to show Daleks that were considered even madder than usual. Actor Karen Gillan admitted that she had not been scared of the Daleks before working on the episode. It is also the first Dalek story Moffat has written for the show; he stated that he \"couldn't resist\" the opportunity.In March 2012, it was announced that Jenna-Louise Coleman would replace Gillan and Arthur Darvill as the next companion, first appearing in the 2012 Christmas special. It was Moffat's idea to have her appear in \"Asylum of the Daleks\" as the character of Oswin; it was not originally planned, and Coleman assumed it was part of her audition at first to see which character fitted her best. He intended to keep her appearance a secret, and thanked the press and fans that it was not leaked. Coleman's scenes were filmed over six days on a closed set with a green screen which she acted to. Whether her later character was the same as Oswin was not confirmed at the time, but her appearance in \"The Snowmen\" makes it clear that there is a connection. Coleman played each version of the character as individuals with \"trust that there would be a payoff\" to her mystery.\"Asylum of the Daleks\" was directed by Nick Hurran, who directed \"The Girl Who Waited\" and \"The God Complex\" of the previous series, as well as the fifth episode of the seventh series. \"Asylum of the Daleks\" contains many of the Dalek types that the Doctor has faced over the years, including the Special Weapons Dalek from the 1988 story Remembrance of the Daleks. According to The Daily Telegraph, the production team located the remaining models of the various versions of the Daleks and shipped them to the studios in Cardiff Bay. This included a Dalek owned by Russell T Davies, Moffat's predecessor. Executive producer Caroline Skinner knew Davies well and asked to borrow his replica. She stated that he was \"thrilled\" that it was canonised. The total number of different Daleks was around 25, with models from 1963 to 2010; Skinner said that \"there was just a real magic and sense of history about having them\". Moffat was concerned about how all the different Daleks would look together, but was pleased once he saw them; he commented that the diversity made them look like a species, rather than identical robots. Many of the props were built from scratch. The snow scenes on the asylum planet were filmed in Spain during the production of \"A Town Called Mercy\". Music featured in the episode are the \"Habanera\" from the Georges Bizet opera Carmen, which is used diegetically, and \"Feel the Love\" by Rudimental is also featured.

He mentions that one of them fancied him; during that episode one sacrificed her life for him.\n\"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe\" marks the debut of Caroline Skinner and sees the end of Wenger as executive producers. The two had previously worked together; Moffat commented it \"will be the smoothest hand-over we've done\". The special was directed by Farren Blackburn, who had previously worked with Skinner on The Fades. Blackburn stated that he was \"daunted, thrilled and excited at the same time\" about the job and that it was \"tough\". Blackburn's favorite sequences to direct were the opening sequence and the scenes set on the winter planet, where he \"really felt like [he] was making a movie\". When asked about the tone he wished to create, Blackburn replied,\n\nI would say there is a kind of mix. It goes through several worlds. It's most definitely a classic action-adventure but I think it merges into the Edwardian children's story and there's a sort of Tim Burton-esque magic about it as well. I think there's a magic throughout the episode, but there is an underlying suspense and tension and darkness to it as well. So I think it merges those three things with an awful lot of Christmas about it.\nThe BBC announced in September 2011 that production had started for the special and filming was due to be complete by mid October 2011. Filming was disrupted on 30 September by a 24-hour protest at BBC Wales because of compulsory redundancies. The opening sequence set in the corridors of a spaceship was filmed on 20 September 2011 at Uskmouth Power Station. As the conditions were very noisy, the crew had to wear ear protectors. Filming of some scenes involving Alexander Armstrong took place in and around the Lancaster bomber Just Jane at the Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Centre on 3 October 2011. External footage of the lighthouse building took place in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire. Actor Matt Smith stated, \"It was a really tough shoot. Out in a forest, at night, and because there were children involved, some shooting schedules had to change radically, we'd often have to shoot through, no breaks \u2013 you get lunch at midnight or something.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures, it is the sequel to Iron Man (2008) and the third film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Jon Favreau and written by Justin Theroux, the film stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man alongside Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Mickey Rourke, and Samuel L. Jackson. Six months after Iron Man, Tony Stark resists calls from the United States government to hand over the Iron Man technology, which is causing his declining health. Meanwhile, Russian scientist Ivan Vanko (Rourke) uses his own version of the technology to pursue a vendetta against the Stark family.\nFollowing the critical and commercial success of Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel Studios announced and immediately set to work on producing a sequel. In July, Theroux was hired to write the script and Favreau was signed to return as director. Downey, Paltrow, and Jackson were set to reprise their roles from Iron Man, while Cheadle was brought in to replace Terrence Howard in the role of James Rhodes. In the early months of 2009, Rourke (Vanko), Rockwell, and Johansson filled out the supporting cast. Filming took place from April to July 2009, mostly in California as in the first film, except for a key sequence in Monaco. Unlike its predecessor, which mixed digital and practical effects, the sequel primarily relied on computer-generated imagery to create the Iron Man suits.\nIron Man 2 premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on April 26, 2010, and was released in the United States on May 7, as part of Phase One of the MCU. The film received praise for its action sequences and performances, although critics deemed it to be inferior to the first film.

Walking with Monsters explores life in the Paleozoic era, showcasing the early development of groups such as arthropods, fish, amphibians, reptiles and synapsids.

Like its predecessors, Walking with Monsters employs computer-generated imagery and animatronics, as well as live action footage shot at various locations, to reconstruct prehistoric life and environments. Owing to being the latest installment, the CGI in Walking with Monsters is more sophisticated, which also contributed to a heavier reliance on CGI than animatronics than in previous series. In total, over 600 scientists were consulted for advice during the production of Walking with Monsters.\nAlthough Walking with Monsters attracted the least viewers out of any Walking with... series during its original airing and received more mixed reviews, the series won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming One Hour or More).

Other countries followed suit, including South Korea, the Philippines (Sailor Moon became one of ABC (now 5)'s main draws, helping it to become the third-biggest network in the country), Poland, Russia, Italy, the Czech Republic, Mexico, Guatemala, Brazil, Ukraine, Belarus, Sweden, Germany, Bulgaria, Austria, Indonesia, Croatia, Hungary, Taiwan, Thailand, Romania and Hong Kong, before North America picked up the franchise for adaptation.:\u200a10\u201311\u200a In 2001, the Sailor Moon manga was Tokyopop's best selling property, outselling the next-best selling titles by at least a factor of 1.5.Sailor Moon sparked a highly successful merchandising campaign of over 5,000 items which contributed to demand internationally and translation into numerous languages. Sailor Moon has since become one of the most famous anime properties in the world. Due to its resurgence of popularity in Japan, the series was rebroadcast on September 1, 2009. The series also began rebroadcasting in Italy in Autumn 2011, receiving permission from Naoko Takeuchi, who released new artwork to promote its return.Critics have commended the anime series for its portrayal of strong friendships as well as for its large cast of \"strikingly different\" characters who have different dimensions and aspects to them as the story continues and for an ability to appeal to a wide audience. Writer Nicolas Penedo attributes the success of Sailor Moon to its fusion of the sh\u014djo manga genre of magical girls with the Saint Seiya fighting teams. According to Martha Cornog and Timothy Perper, Sailor Moon became popular because of its \"strongly-plotted action with fight scenes, rescues\" and its \"emphasis on feelings and relationships\", including some \"sexy romance\" between Usagi and Mamoru. Usagi and Mamoru's romance has been seen as an archetype where the lovers \"become more than the sum of their parts\", promising to be together forever. In contrast, others see Sailor Moon as campy and melodramatic. Criticism has singled out its use of formulaic plots, monsters of the day and stock footage.Screen Rant called the anime \"partly revolutionary for how it depicted its heroines\" as it featured women who were \"distinct because of their personalities,\" while AfterEllen said that the anime \"features the best-known yuri relationship in history\" between Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune. Yuricon said that the relationship could be described as butch-femme\n and CBR called their relationship one of the most beloved, and complex, in the series.Patrick Drazen states that Sailor Moon has two kinds of villains, the \"monster of the day\" and the \"thinking, feeling humans.\" Although this is common in anime and manga, it is \"almost unheard of in the West.\":\u200a284\u200a Despite the series' apparent popularity among Western anime fandom, the dubbed version of the series received poor ratings in the United States when it was initially broadcast in syndication and did not do well in DVD sales in the United Kingdom. Anne Allison attributes the lack of popularity in the United States primarily to poor marketing (in the United States, the series was initially broadcast at times which did not suit the target audience \u2013 weekdays at 9:00 a. m. and 2:00 pm). Executives connected with Sailor Moon suggest that poor localization played a role. British authors Helen McCarthy and Jonathan Clements go further, calling the dub \"indifferent\" and suggesting that Sailor Moon was put in \"dead\" timeslots due to local interests. British distributor MVM Films attributed the low sales to the United Kingdom release being of the dub only, and that major retailers refused to support the show leading to the DVD release appealing to neither children nor older anime fans.Due to anti-Japanese sentiment, most Japanese media other than anime was banned for several decades in South Korea. A producer in KBS \"did not even try to buy\" Sailor Moon because the producer thought it would not pass the censorship laws, but by April 1997, Sailor Moon was airing on KBS 2 without issues and was \"enormously\" popular.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The music of Glee has been a commercial success, with over 36 million digital single sales and eleven million album sales worldwide through October 2011. The series' merchandise also includes DVD and Blu-ray releases, an iPad application, and karaoke games for the Wii home videogame console.

Maureen Ryan of Huffington Post opined that it \"isn't a particularly creative drama but, as was the case with Prison Break in its early seasons, Breakout Kings is sustained by a workmanlike momentum.

One such review came out on SpoilerTV on February 22, 2011 and echoed Sullivan's initial problems with characterization and writing. Indications were that Breakout Kings seems to suffer from rough writing in the pilot, but there was slight improvement in a subsequent episode.

According to Hayser, the series shows a different hero from those already known on Telemundo's screen as drug traffickers as are Aurelio Casillas of El Se\u00f1or de los Cielos, and Teresa Mendonza of La Reina del Sur.For the preparation of Carmelo Alvarado, Hayser read several books about the history of Mexico and subsequent presidents. He also prepared himself by reading the story of Ernesto Guevara, better known as Che Guevara, and the history of the Cuban revolution. In addition to Hayser, Arturo Peniche who had been away from Telemundo for 10 years, since his last telenovela Victoria, returned to the network as part of the main cast of the series playing Pedro Islas, whom the actor described as \"A character full of nuances because it is dark, transparent, manipulative, egocentric, superb\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was also the studio's first film utilizing the three-strip Technicolor process. The film was, in fact, planned to be shot in black and white for most of its development; the switch to Technicolor happened just three months before production started. It was an unusually extravagant production for the Warner Bros. studio, which had made a name for itself in producing socially conscious, low-budget gangster films.Producer Hal B. Wallis is generally seen as the film's creative helmsman. The first draft of the script was written by Rowland Lee, but Wallis objected to its heavily archaic and fanciful dialogue (one line he cited was \"Oh my lord, tarry not too long, for I fear that in her remorse she may fling herself from the window. Some harm may befall her, I know.\"). At Wallis's insistence, the script was heavily rewritten to modernize the dialogue, and whether any of Lee's work survives in the completed film is unclear.The scene in which Robin Hood first meets Prince John, Guy of Gisbourne, and Maid Marian went through several iterations. Initially, the scene was to be at a jousting tournament with Robin tilting against Guy of Gisbourne, mimicking the 1922 Douglas Fairbanks production of Robin Hood, but screenwriter Norman Reilly Raine pointed out that a banquet scene would be much less expensive to produce, and so long as Technicolor was employed, would look just as lavish to the average moviegoer. In another draft, instead of a deer, a slain villager was who Robin Hood brought in and dumped on Prince John's table. Wallis felt the use of a dead villager expended all the tension of the scene in \"a momentary kick\", and preferred the use of a deer from an earlier draft, which allowed the tension to simmer with the threat of an explosion at any moment. During the brawl where Robin escapes from the banquet hall, Basil Rathbone was trampled by an extra whose spear cut his foot badly, requiring eight stitches to close the wound.James Cagney was originally cast as Robin Hood, but walked out on his Warner Bros. contract, paving the way for the role to go to Errol Flynn. The filming was postponed three years as a result. Though Olivia de Havilland was an early frontrunner for the role of Maid Marian, for a time, the studio vacillated between Anita Louise and her for the part. De Havilland was ultimately chosen because the success of Captain Blood established the pairing of Flynn and de Havilland as a safe bet to help ensure box-office success.Location work for The Adventures of Robin Hood included Bidwell Park in Chico, California, which substituted for Sherwood Forest, although one major scene was filmed at the California locations \"Lake Sherwood\" and \"Sherwood Forest\", so named because they were the location sites for the Fairbanks production of Robin Hood. Several scenes were shot at the Warner Bros. Burbank Studios and the Warner Ranch in Calabasas. The archery tournament was filmed at the former Busch Gardens, now part of Lower Arroyo Park, in Pasadena.\nScenes which were filmed, but not included in the final cut include the disguised King Richard brawling with Friar Tuck, and Robin riding off with Maid Marian; the latter would have been the concluding scene of the film, and appears in the theatrical trailer despite not appearing in the film itself.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Simon Kuper of the Financial Times criticised both Land of the Soviets and Tintin in the Congo as the \"worst\" of the Adventures, being \"poorly drawn\" and \"largely plot-free\". Sociologist John Theobald of the Southampton Institute argued that Herg\u00e9 had no interest in providing factual information about the Soviet Union, but only wanted to inculcate his readers against Marxism, hence depicting the Bolsheviks rigging elections, killing opponents and stealing the grain from the people. According to literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolid\u00e8s of Stanford University, Herg\u00e9 cast the Bolsheviks as \"absolute evil\" but was unable to understand how they had risen to power, or what their political views were. This meant that Tintin did not know this either, thereby observing the Soviet \"world of misery\" and fighting Bolsheviks without being able to foment an effective counter-revolution. Literary critic Tom McCarthy described the plot as \"fairly straightforward\" and criticised the depiction of Bolsheviks as \"pantomime cut-outs\".Herg\u00e9 biographer Beno\u00eet Peeters was critical of the opening pages to the story, believing that the illustrations in it were among Herg\u00e9's worst and stating: \"One couldn't have imagined a less remarkable debut for a work destined for such greatness\". He believed that Tintin was an existentialist \"Sartre-esque character\" who existed only through his actions, operating simply as a narrative vehicle throughout the book. Where Herg\u00e9 showed his talent, Peeters thought, was in conveying movement, and in utilising language in a \"constantly imaginative\" way. He considered the story's \"absurdity\" to be its best feature, rejecting plausible scenarios in favour of the \"joyously bizarre\", such as Tintin being frozen solid and then thawing, or Snowy dressing in a tiger skin to scare away a real tiger. Herg\u00e9 biographer Pierre Assouline described the comic writer's image of the Soviet Union as being \"a Dantesque vision of poverty, famine, terror, and repression\".Marking the release of Steven Spielberg's The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn film in 2011, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) commissioned a documentary devoted to Tintin in the Land of the Soviets in which journalist Frank Gardner\u2014who considered Tintin to be his boyhood hero\u2014visited Russia, investigating and defending the accuracy of Herg\u00e9's account of Soviet human rights abuses. First airing on Sunday 30 October on BBC Two, the documentary was produced by Graham Strong, with Luned Tonderai as producer and Tim Green as executive producer. David Butcher reviewed the documentary for the Radio Times, opining that Gardner's trip was dull compared to the comic's adventure, but praising a few \"great moments\", such as the scene in which Gardner tested an open-topped 1929 Amilcar, just as Tintin did in the adventure.", "hasanswer": false}]}

At the age of 21, he was found guilty of stealing two pigs and was transported on the prison ship Prince Regent, arriving at Hobart Town, Van Diemen's Land (now Hobart in the Australian state of Tasmania), on 2 January 1842. After finishing his sentence in January 1848, Red moved to the Colony of Victoria and found work at James Quinn's farm at Wallan Wallan as a bush carpenter.On 18 November 1850, Red married Ellen Quinn, his employer's 18-year-old daughter, at St Francis Church, Father Gerard Ward officiating. The couple subsequently turned their attention to gold-digging and earned enough to buy a small freehold in Beveridge, just north of Melbourne.\nEdward (\"Ned\") Kelly was his parents' third child. The exact date of his birth is not known, but was probably in December 1854. Ned was possibly baptised by an Augustinian priest, Charles O'Hea, who also administered last rites to Kelly before his execution. Ned's parents had seven other children: Mary Jane (born 1851, died as an infant aged 6 months), Annie (later Annie Gunn) (1853\u20131872), Margaret (later Margaret Skillion) (1857\u20131896), James (\"Jim\", 1859\u20131946), Daniel (\"Dan\", 1861\u20131880), Catherine (\"Kate\", later Kate Foster) (1863\u20131898) and Grace (later Grace Griffiths) (1865\u20131940).Ned Kelly's family did not prosper at Beveridge and his father began drinking heavily. In 1864 the family moved to Avenel, near Seymour, where they soon attracted the attention of local police. As a boy Kelly obtained basic schooling and became familiar with the bush. In Avenel he risked his life to save another boy from drowning in Hughes Creek; the boy's family gave him a green sash, which he wore under his armour during his final showdown with police in 1880.In 1865, Red was convicted in relation to the theft of a calf and sentenced to a fine of \u00a325 or six months' hard labour. Although the family could not afford to pay the fine, there is no record of Red being transferred to Kilmore Gaol. In December 1866, Red was fined for being drunk and disorderly. Badly affected by alcoholism, he died at Avenel on 27 December 1866.The following year, the Kellys moved to Greta in north-eastern Victoria, near the Quinns and their relatives by marriage, the Lloyds. In 1868 Ned's uncle Jim Kelly was convicted of arson after setting fire to the rented premises where the Kellys and some of the Lloyds were staying. Jim was sentenced to death, but this was later commuted to fifteen years of hard labour. The family soon leased a small farm of 88 acres (360,000 m2) at Eleven Mile Creek near Greta. The Kelly selection was probably unsuitable for successful farming, and Ellen supplemented her income by offering accommodation to travellers and illegally selling alcohol.", "hasanswer": false}]}

A sequel to Blade Runner (1982), the film stars Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford, with Ana de Armas, Sylvia Hoeks, Robin Wright, Mackenzie Davis, Dave Bautista, and Jared Leto in supporting roles. Ford and Edward James Olmos reprise their roles from the previous film as Rick Deckard and Gaff, respectively. Gosling plays K, a \"blade runner\" who uncovers a secret that threatens to destabilize society and the course of civilization.\nIdeas for a Blade Runner sequel were first proposed in the 1990s, but licensing issues stalled their development. Andrew Kosove and Broderick Johnson obtained the film rights from Bud Yorkin. Ridley Scott stepped down as the film's initial director and worked as an executive producer, while Villeneuve was later appointed to direct. Blade Runner 2049 was financed through a partnership between Alcon Entertainment and Sony Pictures, as well as a Hungarian government-funded tax rebate. Warner Bros., who had distributed its predecessor, released the film on behalf of Alcon in North America, while Sony handled distribution in international markets. Principal photography took place mostly at two soundstages in Budapest over four months from July to November 2016.\nBlade Runner 2049 premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California on October 3, 2017, and was released in the United States on October 6. The film received acclaim from critics, who praised multiple aspects including cast performances, directing, cinematography, and faithfulness to the previous film. Despite this, it was one of the biggest box-office bombs of the year, grossing just $267.5 million worldwide against a production budget of $150\u2013185 million for a reported loss of $80 million.

The reason for the rest was that Moffat felt their frequent appearances made them the \"most reliably defeatable enemies in the universe\". Moffat recalled that the Daleks were remembered for being scary, but due to their legacy as British icons they had become \"cuddly\" over the years and their true menace forgotten; with \"Asylum\" he intended to make them scary again, reminding the audience of their intentions. He thought the best way to do this would be to show Daleks that were considered even madder than usual. Actor Karen Gillan admitted that she had not been scared of the Daleks before working on the episode. It is also the first Dalek story Moffat has written for the show; he stated that he \"couldn't resist\" the opportunity.In March 2012, it was announced that Jenna-Louise Coleman would replace Gillan and Arthur Darvill as the next companion, first appearing in the 2012 Christmas special. It was Moffat's idea to have her appear in \"Asylum of the Daleks\" as the character of Oswin; it was not originally planned, and Coleman assumed it was part of her audition at first to see which character fitted her best. He intended to keep her appearance a secret, and thanked the press and fans that it was not leaked. Coleman's scenes were filmed over six days on a closed set with a green screen which she acted to. Whether her later character was the same as Oswin was not confirmed at the time, but her appearance in \"The Snowmen\" makes it clear that there is a connection. Coleman played each version of the character as individuals with \"trust that there would be a payoff\" to her mystery.\"Asylum of the Daleks\" was directed by Nick Hurran, who directed \"The Girl Who Waited\" and \"The God Complex\" of the previous series, as well as the fifth episode of the seventh series. \"Asylum of the Daleks\" contains many of the Dalek types that the Doctor has faced over the years, including the Special Weapons Dalek from the 1988 story Remembrance of the Daleks. According to The Daily Telegraph, the production team located the remaining models of the various versions of the Daleks and shipped them to the studios in Cardiff Bay. This included a Dalek owned by Russell T Davies, Moffat's predecessor. Executive producer Caroline Skinner knew Davies well and asked to borrow his replica. She stated that he was \"thrilled\" that it was canonised. The total number of different Daleks was around 25, with models from 1963 to 2010; Skinner said that \"there was just a real magic and sense of history about having them\". Moffat was concerned about how all the different Daleks would look together, but was pleased once he saw them; he commented that the diversity made them look like a species, rather than identical robots. Many of the props were built from scratch. The snow scenes on the asylum planet were filmed in Spain during the production of \"A Town Called Mercy\". Music featured in the episode are the \"Habanera\" from the Georges Bizet opera Carmen, which is used diegetically, and \"Feel the Love\" by Rudimental is also featured.

He then signed with Atlantic Records, where he soon reached his mainstream breakthrough and co-founded his own label imprint, Grand Hustle Records by 2003.Harris first gained national recognition following his high-profile guest feature on fellow Atlanta-based rapper Bone Crusher's 2003 single \"Never Scared\". Harris saw wider critical and commercial success with the release of his second album Trap Muzik (2003), which included the Billboard Hot 100-top 40 singles \"Rubber Band Man\" and \"Let's Get Away\" (featuring Jazze Pha). The following year, Harris guest appeared alongside Lil Wayne on Destiny's Child's hit single \"Soldier\", and capitalized on this with the release of his third album, Urban Legend (2004). His next three studio albums each debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart; his fourth and fifth, King (2006) and T.I. vs. T.I.P. (2007) were met with further success and led by the Billboard Hot 100-top ten singles, \"What You Know\" and \"Big Shit Poppin' (Do It)\", respectively.\nHarris' sixth album, Paper Trail (2008) remains his most successful release to date, as it received gold certification for first-week sales of over 500,000 copies in the United States. It spawned two Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles: \"Whatever You Like\" and \"Live Your Life\" (featuring Rihanna); the latter replaced the former atop the chart, and made Harris the first rapper to do so while occupying its top two positions. Following an eleven-month incarceration, he released his seventh studio album, No Mercy (2010) to mixed reviews and a commercial decline. His eighth album, Trouble Man: Heavy Is the Head (2012) was met with a dual rebound. Harris guest featured alongside Pharrell Williams on Robin Thicke's 2013 single \"Blurred Lines\", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and 22 other countries.\nThe following year, his contract with Atlantic expired; he signed with Columbia Records and enlisted Williams as executive producer for his ninth studio album, Paperwork (2014). As with his previous, it reached number two on the Billboard 200 and saw positive critical reception. The following year, he worked further with album collaborator and then-upcoming hometown native Young Thug to form the short-lived hip hop collective, Bankroll Mafia. He signed with Jay-Z's Roc Nation in 2016 to release his political Us or Else (2016\u20132017) extended play series and compilation album, We Want Smoke (2017); he later signed with Epic Records in 2018 to release his long-delayed tenth album, Dime Trap in October of that year. His eleventh album, The L.I.B.R.A. (2020) was first independent studio release. His twelfth album, Kill the King was announced as his final, although its release slate remains unclear.\nHarris, a three Grammy Award winner, is often described as a leading figure in hip hop music during the 2000s, particularly in Southern hip hop. He has received 19 nominations for the award, as well as 12 Billboard Music Awards, three BET Awards, and two American Music Awards. Prominent industry artists have signed to T.I. through his Grand Hustle Records label since its formation, including Travis Scott, B.o.B, and Iggy Azalea. In his acting career, Harris has starred in the films ATL, Takers, Get Hard, Identity Thief, and in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Ant-Man and its sequel, as well as the reality television series T.I.'s Road to Redemption, T.I. & Tiny: The Family Hustle, and The Grand Hustle. He is also a published author of two novels, Power & Beauty (2011) and Trouble & Triumph (2012). By the end of the decade, Billboard ranked him as the 27th best artist of the 2000s.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The Business reported that Weston was ousted when non-executive directors informed the chairman that they had lost confidence in him. Further, it was suggested that at least one non-executive director was encouraged to make such a move by the MoD due to the increasingly fractious relationship between BAE Systems and the government.

The Business said he considered this \"competition-policy gone mad\".It is understood that Turner had a poor working relationship with senior MoD officials, for example with former Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon. The first meeting between Oliver and Hoon was said to have gone well; a MoD official commented \"He is a man we can do business with\". It has been suggested that relations between Turner and Olver were tense. On 16 October 2007 the company announced that Mike Turner would retire in August 2008.

She always carries a small semi-automatic pistol in her purse and speaks in a childlike, innocent manner. She lives by herself in a small house and talks occasionally with her mother over the telephone about what she did during the day.\nInvestigating the vigilante killings is a local sheriff. He soon meets and develops an attraction to Miss Meadows due to her old-fashioned clothing and style of speech. When he begins to suspect that the woman he finds himself drawn to may be the suspect he is looking for, the sheriff is torn between whether to arrest or protect her.\nWhen Miss Meadows meets an ex-convict named Skylar, who she learns served time for molesting young children, she begins to fear for her young students' safety. When Miss Meadows approaches and threatens to kill Skylar if he continues hanging around the school or around her kids, he begins stalking her.\nIt is eventually revealed that all of the telephone conversations that Miss Meadows has been having with her mother over the course of the film are imaginary. As a young girl, Mary Meadows witnessed her mother's murder in a drive-by shooting outside a local church after attending the wedding of a family friend. This traumatic incident left Miss Meadows so emotionally scarred that she entered a fantasy world in which she imagined that her mother was still alive, then began to go after and kill criminals whom she viewed as a threat to society.\nThe various criminals that Miss Meadows kills on-screen include a trucker who tries to abduct her at gunpoint in the opening scene, a young man who committed a mass shooting at a local diner, and the town's Catholic priest whom Miss Meadows finds sexually molesting a young boy.\nWhen Miss Meadows learns that she is pregnant after a sexual encounter with the sheriff, she decides to accept his proposal of marriage. On the day of the wedding, Skylar kidnaps Heather, one of Miss Meadows's students, from her house, forcing Miss Meadows to go to Skylar's house (wearing her wedding dress) to try to stop him, only to end up a captive herself. When she manages to free Heather and struggle with Skylar over her gun, the sheriff, passing by after leaving the church, sees Heather running from Skylar's house as she shouts for help. Meanwhile, Skylar takes Miss Meadows' gun from her purse, aims it at her and asks, \"Do you really think you can save the world? Well, try saving yourself first!\" Just then, the sheriff arrives and fatally shoots Skylar in the head. Seeing Miss Meadows' gun still clutched in Skylar's hand, he notes \"it has his prints now\".

The show is similar to fellow Ruegger-led programs such as Animaniacs, having a unique style of humor that includes slapstick, fourth wall breaking, parody, surreal humour, and pop culture references.\nThe series debuted on Kids' WB on September 9, 1995 alongside Animaniacs, The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries, and Pinky and the Brain. The series lasted for two seasons across 24 episodes, with the final episode being broadcast on June 1, 1997. Although the series originally struggled in ratings, reruns on Cartoon Network and a fan following elevated it to become a cult hit.

NME's Will Richards gave the series three out of five stars, describing it as a second-chance for the Alex Rider series following the failure of the 2006 Stormbreaker movie adaptation. Richards observed that the series avoided the clich\u00e9d James Bond gadgets for the first two episodes. Richards praised Farrant's performance as Alex Rider but opined that the series needed tinkering to identify its target audience. Richards also described co-star Brenock O'Connor's performance as Alex's best friend Tom Harris as charismatic.

He regarded Alex Rider as more faithful to the series than the 2006 Stormbreaker film. He also praised Farrant's version of Alex Rider as more plausible than Alex Pettyfer's version of the character, describing the former as \"a teenage schoolboy with a footballer haircut but less of a male-model energy.\" Cumming also praised the series for aiming at both young adults and adults, inclusion of modern communications technologies like smartphones and social media, and more diverse cast. The Spinoff's reviewer Sam Brooks praised the TV series for capturing the spirit of the original novel series and appealing to both teenagers and adult fans who had grown up reading the novel series. Brooks also praised Farrant's performance as Alex Rider, opining that he nailed the soul of the teenage protagonist by capturing his strengths, moods, and fears.The Telegraph's Anita Singh gave the series four out of five stars, describing it as \"slick and stylish, bringing the stories up-to-date with smartphones and cybertechnology while sticking to the spirit of Boy's Own adventures\". She regarded it as far superior to the 2006 film and praised the series for its unique cinematography of London. Singh also positively compared it to the Bourne franchise and praised the series for being able to entertain adults and teenagers alike. Emmy Griffiths of Hello! magazine compared the television series favourably to the 2006 film, praising the show's pacing, worldbuilding, and family-oriented audience. She described the series as both a \"coming-of-age tale\" for Alex Rider with a police-procedural subplot focusing on MI6's efforts to track down Alex's uncle Ian's killer.

In return, 20th Century Fox received the international distribution rights to the film.

It is unclear whether Katsu was fired or left of his own accord, but he was replaced by Tatsuya Nakadai, a well-known actor who had appeared in a number of Kurosawa's previous films. Nakadai played both the kagemusha and the lord whom he impersonated.\nKurosawa wrote a part in Kagemusha for his longtime regular actor Takashi Shimura, and Kagemusha was the last Kurosawa film in which Shimura appeared.

Feature Animation and directed by Brad Bird in his directorial debut. It is based on the 1968 novel The Iron Man by Ted Hughes (which was published in the United States as The Iron Giant), and was written by Tim McCanlies from a story treatment by Bird. The film stars the voices of Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., Vin Diesel, James Gammon, Cloris Leachman, John Mahoney, Eli Marienthal, Christopher McDonald, and M. Emmet Walsh. Set during the Cold War in 1957, the film centers on a young boy named Hogarth Hughes, who discovers and befriends a giant alien robot. With the help of a beatnik artist named Dean McCoppin, Hogarth attempts to prevent the U.S. military and Kent Mansley, a paranoid federal agent, from finding and destroying the Giant.\nThe film's development began in 1994 as a musical with the involvement of the Who's Pete Townshend, though the project took root once Bird signed on as director and hired McCanlies to write the screenplay in 1996. The film was animated using traditional animation, with computer-generated imagery used to animate the Iron Giant and other effects. The understaffed crew of the film completed it with half of the time and budget of other animated features. Michael Kamen composed the film's score, which was performed by the Czech Philharmonic.\nThe Iron Giant premiered at Mann's Chinese Theater in Los Angeles on July 31, 1999, and was released in the United States on August 6.

{"id": "1431_196", "question": "Who was the executive producer of Betty Blue?", "ctxs": [{"id": "674_54506", "text": "The idea to bring Ugly Betty to American TV screens began in 2001 when NBC was planning to adapt Betty as a half-hour comedy, which would be produced by Columbia TriStar Television (now Sony Pictures Television) but it did not get past the planning stages (three writers were needed to come up with a concept based around the character) until ABC and Hayek's company came on board in 2004 and retooled it as an hour-long comedy drama. Two years later, on May 16, 2006, ABC announced that Ugly Betty would be part of the 2006\u20132007 North American season lineup as a weekly hour-long series; the initial order was for 13 episodes.\nABC had announced the title of the series would be Betty the Ugly, a change from its developmental title, but changed it back to Ugly Betty on July 14, 2006, although the Ugly Betty title was already being used in promotions prior to this date on Citytv. Speculation indicated the show would be a daily serial that would have debuted as a summer 2006 or midseason 2007 entry, but given the buzz and growing interest in the show, the network decided to make it a weekly series, instead. On August 8, 2006, ABC decided at the last minute to make a schedule change to move Ugly Betty from its previously announced Friday 8 pm (ET) time period to Thursday at 8 pm, replacing sitcoms Notes from the Underbelly and Big Day as a lead-in to top-rated program Grey's Anatomy, due to the growing interest in the show.\nThe program's pilot was tested on several cable providers to gauge interest and feedback from viewers, most notably the Hispanic community, including those who are fans of the original Betty, who hoped that ABC would maintain the integrity of the original. ABC also allowed its affiliates to show free off-air screenings to the public at various events ahead of the show's debut. In addition, the network screened the debut episode on the web and made the episodes available for download on iTunes after their initial airings on January 5, 2007. The encore episodes also have run on ABC Family and SOAPnet, both of which have aired marathons of the show.\nOn October 13, 2006, ABC ordered a full season pick-up for the series, beyond the original 13 ordered at the May Upfronts due to its premiere ratings. ABC originally announced 22 episodes for season one, but increased the number of episodes by one to 23. The season finale is the episode called \"East Side Story\". On March 21, 2007, ABC renewed the series for a second season.Although he subsequently joined NBC as their new entertainment head, Ben Silverman remained co-executive producer on the show, but in a limited role.In November 2007, the cast of the series made headlines when they threw their support behind the 2007 Writers' Strike by joining them on the picket line in solidarity. Ferrera commented on the reason they did this: \"The issues coming up with the actors' contracts are very similar to what the writers are dealing with right now, and we have to stay united and stand strong within the creative community for what we believe is fair.\" On November 25, the cast appeared in a 38-second video for \"Speechless Hollywood\" in which a black & white camera pulled away from a close up of Ferrera to show her co-stars sitting next to her as they look directly at the camera without speaking.On February 11, 2008, ABC picked up Ugly Betty for the 2008\u201309 television season, along with nine other shows. On the same day the renewal was announced, two of the show's executive producers, Marco Pennette and James Hayman, were let go. Their departure added to the constant off-camera turnovers on the series, including the exiting or firing of five writers. In a Q&A from TV Guide, Michael Ausiello criticized the decision, saying, \"someone saw fit to fix what wasn't broken\" and praised the two men for writing several of the show's best episodes. These turns of events may have also contributed to Rebecca Romijn's decision to no longer be a full-time regular on the series in the third season, citing the move by new writers to make changes in the direction of several characters, especially Romijn's role as Alexis.With the strike over as of February 12,  the possibility existed for seven new episodes to be completed by April, bringing the number of second-season episodes produced to 20, but only 18 episodes were eventually produced. As a result of the strike, creator Silvio Horta delayed plans for a musical episode and having Lindsay Lohan on board for a possible storyline until the third season. Four days later on February 16, 2008, ABC picked up Ugly Betty for the 2008\u201309 television season.On March 12, 2008, Horta signed a two-year, seven-figure deal with ABC Studios, which guaranteed the show's future and gave Horta a chance to produce other projects aside from Betty.On April 17, 2008, the show's podcast, which was usually presented in audio and hosted by stars Urie and Newton, became available on video for the first time.On May 6, 2008, ABC announced that starting with the third season, Ugly Betty would return to New York City and start production there. The move was done to bring the authenticity of the great series' setting into the show and to take advantage of a tax credit offered by the State of New York's Governor's Office of Motion Picture and Television Development. The production returned to Silvercup Studios in Queens, where the original pilot was produced.  The move resulted in several Los Angeles crew members being let go. These events led California Assemblyman Paul Krekorian to introduce bill AB X315, the \"Ugly Betty Bill\", which would keep television and film production from leaving the state by using tax incentives. The bill was passed by the assembly and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed it into law on February 19, 2009.In January 2009, ABC announced that it was putting Ugly Betty on hold to make room for the new comedies In the Motherhood and Samantha Who? in the Thursday night time slot. The series' aired one more original episode on March 19, 2009. On March 15, 2009, ABC announced that, after a five-week break, Ugly Betty would return for its final five episodes of the season on April 30, 2009. Ugly Betty's return was originally planned for May 7, but due to low ratings for Motherhood, ABC moved it up a week. The two-episode season finale aired on Thursday, May 21 from 8\u201310 pm.The move by ABC and the show's declining ratings led viewers to believe that ABC would cancel the show, but on February 17, 2009, Becki Newton stated that the show had been picked up for a fourth season. That statement would later be confirmed on March 5, 2009, when Stephen McPherson, president of ABC Entertainment Group, announced that ABC planned to renew Ugly Betty. On April 23, 2009, ABC gave an early fourth season renewal to Betty.Ugly Betty  began airing on Friday nights starting October 16, 2009, at 9:00 pm Eastern/8:00 pm Central, although it was originally scheduled to start a week earlier on October 9. This caused fans and critics to worry that ABC wished to end the show, since that time slot is perceived as the Friday night death slot.

Malcolm and John learn that Lester may be seeking to find his ex-girlfriend, Sherry Pierce, an employee of the bank who is suspected of supplying him with a key to the vault, as the money that was stolen was never recovered. \nMalcolm and John stake out the house of Sherry's estranged grandmother, Hattie Mae Pierce\u2014an obese, elderly African American woman, whom her friends affectionately call Big Momma\u2014in Cartersville, Georgia. After setting up security cameras and ending up in the shower curtain, Big Momma rushes to the toilet, causing her to defecate quite violently as a result of eating homemade stewed prunes. She then takes a shower, where a traumatized Malcolm escapes. They soon find out she is about to leave town for two weeks to care for her ill friend at the hospital. Malcolm takes the advantage by disguising himself as Big Momma to bring Sherry to her house to get her confession to her involvement in the robbery. To maintain his disguise as Big Momma, Malcolm must maintain the real Big Momma's lifestyle. This includes dealing with her lecherous boyfriend, assuming her occupation as a midwife, and attending self-defense classes led by dim-witted security guard Nolan, whom the agents are later forced to recruit when he stumbles onto their operation. \nDuring this time, Malcolm bonds with Sherry and her ten-year-old son, Trent, both in disguise and as himself\u2014posing as Big Momma's handyman. He finds nothing to link her to the robbery, nor to the missing money's location. After attending a church service with them, where he compels Sherry in his disguise to not hold any secrets, Malcolm finds the missing money in Trent's footlocker. This happens after returning home to a surprise birthday party for the real Big Momma. His discovery is witnessed by Sherry, who tells him she had no idea what Lester was planning, and did not report her key was stolen out of fear of being fired.\nMatters soon become complicated when John discovers that the real Big Momma has returned home. In his efforts to stop her re-entering the house, John instructs Nolan to lock her out, only for the dim-witted guard to accidentally lock Malcolm out. Lester tracks Sherry down to Big Momma's house and later puts her in danger. Malcolm swiftly breaks into the house, whereupon he tackles Lester and subdues him after John is shot, but at the cost of his disguise being dropped in front of everyone, including Sherry and Trent. After Lester is arrested and the money recovered, Malcolm finds that Sherry and Trent refuse to speak to him, heartbroken by his deception. \nSeeking forgiveness, Malcolm attends the Sunday morning church service, where he gives a heartfelt speech to Sherry and Trent declaring he genuinely loves them. Big Momma forgives him for his actions, and the church crowd cheers as Malcolm and Sherry kiss, before Big Momma and the choir sing \"Oh Happy Day\" during the film's closing credits.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He stated that \"nothing is more fun to write\" than the Doctor at Christmas, as he considered it \"his kind of day. Everything's bright and shiny, everybody's having a laugh, and nobody minds if you wear a really stupid hat\". The story is partly inspired by The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (from The Chronicles of Narnia) by C. S. Lewis. Moffat said that Doctor Who and the Narnia stories \"come from the same impulse that children have of escaping to another world.\"The scene in which the Doctor is showing the Arwells around the house originally included a scene in a \"haunted coal cellar\". The characters of Ven-Garr and Billis are named after outgoing executive producers Piers Wenger and Beth Willis, both of whom served with Moffat. The three tree harvesters are from Androzani Major in the year 5345, a planet which features in the serial The Caves of Androzani (1984). The Doctor mentions the Forest of Cheem, which appeared in the Ninth Doctor episode \"The End of the World\". He mentions that one of them fancied him; during that episode one sacrificed her life for him.\n\"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe\" marks the debut of Caroline Skinner and sees the end of Wenger as executive producers. The two had previously worked together; Moffat commented it \"will be the smoothest hand-over we've done\". The special was directed by Farren Blackburn, who had previously worked with Skinner on The Fades. Blackburn stated that he was \"daunted, thrilled and excited at the same time\" about the job and that it was \"tough\". Blackburn's favorite sequences to direct were the opening sequence and the scenes set on the winter planet, where he \"really felt like [he] was making a movie\". When asked about the tone he wished to create, Blackburn replied,\n\nI would say there is a kind of mix. It goes through several worlds. It's most definitely a classic action-adventure but I think it merges into the Edwardian children's story and there's a sort of Tim Burton-esque magic about it as well. I think there's a magic throughout the episode, but there is an underlying suspense and tension and darkness to it as well. So I think it merges those three things with an awful lot of Christmas about it.\nThe BBC announced in September 2011 that production had started for the special and filming was due to be complete by mid October 2011. Filming was disrupted on 30 September by a 24-hour protest at BBC Wales because of compulsory redundancies. The opening sequence set in the corridors of a spaceship was filmed on 20 September 2011 at Uskmouth Power Station. As the conditions were very noisy, the crew had to wear ear protectors. Filming of some scenes involving Alexander Armstrong took place in and around the Lancaster bomber Just Jane at the Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Centre on 3 October 2011. External footage of the lighthouse building took place in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire. Actor Matt Smith stated, \"It was a really tough shoot.
