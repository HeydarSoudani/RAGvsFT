About its venue he said, \"Playboy magazine, whatever you may say about its content, always did a first-rate job of printing color pictures.\" According to comics commentators Randy Duncan and Matthew J. Smith, the series \"reads today as an amusing look at the evolving mores of the sexual revolution\". Comics editor Monte Beauchamp said that Little Annie Fanny was \"the most elaborate comic strip ever created\" and cartoonist-critic R. C. Harvey called it \"a masterpiece ... the most lavish color comic strip of all time\".Not all were as impressed. Noting that Kurtzman was financially strapped before making his living for twenty-six years from Playboy, historian Paul Buhle wrote: \"The strip had many brilliant early moments, but went downhill as the writer and artist bent to editor Hugh Hefner's demands for as much titillation as possible.\" Cartoonist Art Spiegelman said that Little Annie Fanny devolved from the more interesting Goodman Beaver. Underground cartoonist Robert Crumb, whose career Kurtzman helped launch, scorned Playboy and Annie. Monty Python's Terry Gilliam, the former assistant editor of Help!, said that Little Annie Fanny was not as sharp as Kurtzman's earlier work: \"technically brilliant but ... slightly compromised.\" Art agent and publisher Denis Kitchen, who handles Kurtzman and Eisner's estates, said that \"most Kurtzman devotees would not consider Little Annie Fanny genius work ... [and] some would argue the opposite: that it was genius diluted or degraded\". Kitchen placed the onus on Kurtzman's employer Hefner, who \"was often a punctilious taskmaster with a heavy red pen who often had very different ideas about what was funny or satiric\" and insisted that each strip \"had to include Annie disrobing\". Beauchamp agreed: \"Unfortunately, Hefner was notorious for his heavy editorial hand.\" Duncan and Smith also agreed, and wrote that \"humor sometimes mixes awkwardly with the loaded topics of the era, and some have found Annie's lack of character development and the requisite sexual hijinks an impediment to taking her seriously.\" However, they repeated their respect: \"The eternally innocent Annie performed admirably as a nonjudgmental witness to the changing tides of the sexual revolution.\"American cartoonist Budd Root cited Little Annie Fanny as one of the inspirations for his independent comic book series Cavewoman.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The text states that\"The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\"Unlike the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, there is no general right to equal treatment, only in the areas covered by the Convention. However, the article covers an open-ended list of prohibited grounds for discrimination and has been expanded over time to include such grounds as sexual orientation. In the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, the interpretation of the article has expanded over time to include indirect discrimination. Protocol 12 to the European Convention on Human Rights expands on Article 14 to include a freestanding prohibition of discrimination in \"any right set forth by law\". Introduced in 2000, it has been ratified by 20 of 47 Council of Europe states as of 2021.In early cases before the European Court of Human Rights the court assumed that for Article 14 to be relevant, a breach of one of the substantive Convention rights had to have occurred. If the court did find a substantive breach, it would not find it necessary to consider Article 14. In the Belgian Linguistic case in 1968, the Belgian government argued that Article 14 was not relevant unless there was a substantive breach. For the first time, the court rejected this argument. Following this case, the court considers that for Article 14 to be considered \"it suffices that the facts of a case fall within the ambit of another substantive provision of the Convention or its Protocols\".The court focuses on substantive equality rather than formal equality, and therefore it considers affirmative action acceptable in certain circumstances. According to the court's case law, any difference in treatment based on fixed status must be proportional to the justified aims pursued and the margin of appreciation has especially narrowed with regard to different treatment based exclusively on ethnic origin, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. For example, in the 2013 case Vallianatos and Others v. Greece a registered partnership scheme that only recognized different-sex couples was ruled to be a violation of Article 14 because it discriminated against same-sex couples.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Falada is often restored to life in film versions, or even spared entirely. While the Queen is implied to have died in the original story, many versions also have her survive to expose the false bride at the wedding. The false bride's motive for suggesting such a cruel punishment varies by retelling; in some, she is simply too ignorant to recognize herself, others have her play along to keep the charade, and others imply she has believed the king is talking about the true bride. Such film versions include:\n\nHarold MacGrath adapted the story into a novel, which was then developed into a 1915 American silent film starring Marguerite Clark. In this version, the princess is stolen at birth and raised as a goose-girl, by a courtier who places his own daughter in her stead. The king she was engaged to at birth falls in love with her without knowing who she is. The courtier's daughter, Hildegarde, is ignorant of the truth and portrayed sympathetically in the original novel, but the film version restores her role as a villainess, where she is raised by her father and is only presented as the princess when she has come of age. The film is believed to be lost.\nThe plot was reworked into 2002's The Princess and the Pea, combining it with another fairy tale.\nThe Goose Girl, a 1957 West German film by Fritz Genschow.\nThe fairy tale was shown in the 1960s television show Jackanory during Season 1, Episode 38 and was read by Dilys Hamlett.\nIn 1985, Tom Davenport adapted the story into a short film as one of his \"From the Brothers Grimm\" series. While visibly set in the American Appalachia, the narration refers to the characters as princesses, princes, and kings, implying that the story retained its European setting. This version is more faithful to Grimm, as Falada is not restored and the false bride is put to death.\nThe story was adapted by East German studio DEFA for their fairytale movie series in the 1989 film The Goose Princess (Die Geschichte von der G\u00e4nseprinzessin und ihrem treuen Pferd Falada), directed by Konrad Petzold.\nTitled \"The Goose Maiden\" in this version, the tale was loosely adapted into a 1999 German short animated episode with slight differences from the source material. This episode was a part of the series SimsalaGrimm. While Falada is still beheaded, this version has him restored to life. There is no prince, but the king himself is the betrothed. Another change is that the princess has been bewitched into forgetting who she is, rather than being forced into posing as the goose-girl.\nThe story was featured in the anime Manga Sekai Mukashi Banashi. In this version, the evil maid is explicitly a witch's daughter. Similar to SimsalaGrimm, the prince and the king are conflated, and he recognizes the princess after overhearing her talk to Falada's head. In the end, the prince makes a charm with his own blood to defeat the witch.Literature:\n\nThe Goose Girl by Shannon Hale is an adaptation of the tale in the form of a novel.\nBloodleaf, the first of a young adult fantasy trilogy by Crystal Smith, is a gothic retelling of \"The Goose Girl.\" It was published by HMHTeen in 2019.\n\"The Goose Girl\" was one of the many folktales used in  Emma Donoghue's novel Kissing The Witch. The tale was titled \"The Tale of The Handkerchief\".\nAuthor Alethea Kontis adapted this tale together with The Wild Swans in the form of a novel titled Dearest.\nAdrienne Rich's 1974 poem \"The Fact of a Doorframe\" references the Goose Girl.\nThe tale was retold into a short children's book by Eric A. Kimmel.\nIn the sh\u014djo manga Ludwig Revolution (\u30eb\u30fc\u30c9\u30f4\u30a3\u30c3\u30d2\u9769\u547d R\u016bdovihhi Kakumei) the story tells about Prince Ludwig who is ordered by his father to find himself a wife more suitable than the women he often brings into the castle. Along with his servant Wilhelm, they travel across the land in search of fair maidens from classic stories in hopes of finding Ludwig a wife. It includes the tale of \"The Goose Girl\" among other tales from the Brothers Grimm.\n\"Falada: the Goose Girl's Horse\" is a short story adaption by author Nancy Farmer. This version tells the classic tale from Falada's point of view.\nThe Canadian poet Jay Macpherson references the story of the Goose Girl in her poems \"Poor Child\" and \"What Falada Said,\" both reprinted in Poems Twice Told: The Boatman and Welcoming Disaster.\nThe Scottish comic book writer Grant Morrison references the story in Doom Patrol issue 31, \"The Word Made Flesh,\" when Baphomet takes the form of Falada's head.\nIntisar Khanani, author of the Sunbolt Chronicles, wrote a fantasy retelling of the Goose Girl, titled \"Thorn\". The novel was independently published in 2012 and re-published by HarperCollins in 2020.\n\"Feathers of Snow: A Goose Girl Retelling\" by Alice Ivinya is a book based on the fairy tale.\nThough Eudora Welty's novella The Robber Bridegroom is named after and largely follows the plot of a different Brothers Grimm fairy tale, much of the action derives from \"The Goose Girl.\"\n\"Little Thieves\" by Margeret Owen is a YA fantasy novel retelling the story of the Goose Girl from the perspective of the princess' maid. It was published in 2021 by Henry Holt and Co.Other:\n\nAlthough an original story, the German opera K\u00f6nigskinder by Engelbert Humperdinck was inspired by Brothers Grimm fairy tales, particularly \"The Goose Girl.\"\nIn the Doom Patrol comics and live-action series, Baphomet, a magical oracle able to appear in any guise she chooses, in the Unwritten Book storyline, chose to appear in the guise of Falada the magic horse, from The Goose Girl.", "hasanswer": false}]}

One night, Booth and his friend, bar owner Herb \"Tookey\" Tooklander, attempt to rescue the wife and daughter of a motorist named Gerard Lumley, whose vehicle is stranded in a ferocious blizzard.

Booth nearly falls victim to Lumley's daughter, but Tookey throws a Douay Bible at her as both men scramble into the Scout, quickly fleeing the area.\nBooth concludes by saying Tookey died of a heart attack a couple of years after the incident. He mentions that he has nightmares about that night and about Lumley's daughter, and warns the reader that if they are in the area, to never go up the road into Jerusalem's Lot for any reason, especially at night, lest the reader encounters Lumley's daughter, the little girl who is \"still waiting for her goodnight kiss\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

With this tune, the hymn has been included in several hymnals, such as Christian Friedrich Witt's Neues Cantional and the Evangelisches Gesangbuch, where it is numbered EG 83. Gerhardt's hymn was however also sung to the tune of \"Herr Gott, erh\u00f6re die Gerechtigkeit\", Zahn No. 7669, and several other melodies were composed for the text: Johannes Zahn lists three 17th-century melodies composed for \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\" (Nos. 7681\u20137683), three from the 18th century (Nos. 7684\u20137686, the first of which was composed for a reworked version of the text), and two from the 19th century (Nos. 7687\u20137688).The third part of a Passion setting presented in Rudolstadt in 1688 opens with Gerhardt's \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\" in the format of an aria, using the \"An Wasserfl\u00fcssen Babylon\" melody. Reinhard Keiser was the first composer who used Gerhardt's hymn in a Passion oratorio in Hamburg: his 1711 setting of Johann Ulrich K\u00f6nig's Thr\u00e4nen unter dem Creutze Jesus libretto opens with it. The second part of Johann Friedrich Fasch's setting of the Brockes Passion libretto, composed around 1717\u20131719, opens with a chorale adaptation of \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\". A Passion oratorio performed in Gotha in 1719 contained an aria based on an excerpt of Gerhardt's hymn.In 1720, Gottfried Heinrich St\u00f6lzel composed a meditation of the stations of the Cross as a Passion oratorio which he titled Die leidende und am Creutz sterbende Liebe Jesu (The love of Jesus which suffered and died on the Cross), which is also known by its incipit, Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld. Composed for Gotha, this oratorio knew many repeat performances, some of these in slightly modified versions: the oratorio was for instance performed in Leipzig in 1734, entitled Der Gl\u00e4ubigen Seele Geistliche Betrachtungen Ihres leidenden Jesu, directed by J. S. Bach, and, in 1736, in Rudolstadt and in N\u00fcrnberg.Three Passions by Georg Philipp Telemann are also known by their incipit Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld: a St Mark Passion of 1723, TWV 5:8, a St John Passion of 1745, TWV 5:30, and a St Matthew Passion of 1766, TWV 5:51. Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld, GWV 1119/24, is a church cantata for the last Sunday before Lent (Estomihi) composed by Christoph Graupner in 1724. Johann Gottfried Walther set \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\" for organ. BWV 267 is Johann Sebastian Bach's chorale harmonisation of Dachstein's hymn tune. Carl Heinrich Graun composed a Passion named after the hymn, Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld, GraunWV B:VII:4, for soloists, choir and orchestra, which has been called Kleine Passion (Little Passion), in comparison to his better-known Der Tod Jesu.Gottfried August Homilius, a Kreuzkantor in Dresden, composed a Passion cantata for soloists, choir and orchestra, HoWV I.2, printed by Breitkopf in 1775. Like his St Matthew Passion, HoWV 1.3, it starts with the words \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\".

Although Mulga Bill claims expertise in riding all things his ineptitude and subsequent accident suggest that he may only know how to ride a horse.\nThe poem was first published in The Sydney Mail on 25 July 1896 and was illustrated by Norman Hardy who depicts Mulga Bill sat astride the front wheel pedaling with his knees UNDER the handle bars establishing with certainty that he is riding an Ordinary on his perilous ride. It is amongst Paterson's most popular works.  A 1973 reprinting of the poem illustrated by Kilmeny & Deborah Niland has been continuously in print since publication and won the 1973 ABPA Book Design Award and the 1974 Visual Arts Board Award.The novel by H. G. Wells on cycling, The Wheels of Chance: A Bicycling Idyll was published in the same year as this poem.Ordinaries- the term \"Penny-Farthings\" is used interchangeably by many- were notoriously dangerous to ride on level ground, but Banjo has Mulga Bill cycling DOWNHILL on a mountain road at which point he gains so much speed that he becomes the Ordinary's PASSENGER, unable to stop or dismount it. On a standard bicycle one's feet could touch the ground to (inelegantly) brake their speed on a dirt road. But this being an Ordinary, once Mulga Bill sets off downhill with no previous experience riding one, he becomes a victim of his own hubris.  There is no escaping his fate and he narrowly escapes death when his ride concludes with him sailing off of a precipice and crashes into a creek. Pride indeed came before Mulga's fall\nThe model for the character of Mulga Bill was William Henry Lewis (1880-1968), who knew Paterson in the vicinity of Bourke, New South Wales. Lewis had bought his bicycle as a result of a drought when there was no feed for horses.Eaglehawk, Victoria\u2014once a rural mining town, now part of greater Bendigo\u2014was given as Mulga Bill's hometown ('Twas Mulga Bill, from Eaglehawk ...). This has been recognised with the development of the Mulga Bill Bicycle Trail, a scenic ride taking in many of the mining attractions, historic sites and modern-day amenities of Eaglehawk.Mulga is a very common species of Acacia that predominates the interior regions of the Australian bush, and colloquially, it is an alternative term for the Bush itself or wilderness regions,  for example \u2018up the mulga\u2019. This poem is extremely important to Australian culture because it includes the start of the cycling craze.  In the time this poem was written, everyone was buying bicycles because it was (and still partly is) popular in Australia.\nThe poem has been set to music and the poem title was the name of a prominent Australian folk music group (also known as a bush band) in the 1970s.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "1433_21", "question": "What larger work was \"The Breathing Method\" published in?", "ctxs": [{"id": "106_32528", "text": "Kerouac is generally considered to be the father of the Beat movement, although he actively disliked such labels. Kerouac's method was heavily influenced by the prolific explosion of\njazz, especially the Bebop genre established by Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, and others. Later, Kerouac included ideas he developed from his Buddhist studies that began with Gary Snyder. He often referred to his style as \"spontaneous prose.\" Although Kerouac's prose was spontaneous and purportedly without edits, he primarily wrote autobiographical novels (or roman \u00e0 clef) based upon actual events from his life and the people with whom he interacted. This approach is reflected also by his plot structure: Kerouac's narratives were not heavily focused on traditional plot structures. Instead, his works often revolved around a series of episodic encounters, road trips, and personal reflections. The emphasis was on the characters' experiences and the exploration of themes such as freedom, rebellion, and the search for meaning.\n\nMany of his books exemplified this spontaneous approach, including On the Road, Visions of Cody, Visions of Gerard, Big Sur, and The Subterraneans. The central features of this writing method were the ideas of breath (borrowed from jazz and from Buddhist meditation breathing), improvising words over the inherent structures of mind and language, and limited revision. Connected with this idea of breath was the elimination of the period, substituting instead a long connecting dash. As such, the phrases occurring between dashes might resemble improvisational jazz licks. When spoken, the words take on a certain musical rhythm and tempo.Kerouac greatly admired and was influenced by Gary Snyder. The Dharma Bums contains accounts of a mountain climbing trip Kerouac took with Snyder, and includes excerpts of letters from Snyder. While living with Snyder outside Mill Valley, California, in 1956, Kerouac worked on a book about him, which he considered calling Visions of Gary. (This eventually became Dharma Bums, which Kerouac described as \"mostly about [Snyder].\") That summer, Kerouac took a job as a fire lookout on Desolation Peak in the North Cascades in Washington, after hearing Snyder's and Whalen's stories of working as fire spotters. Kerouac described the experience in Desolation Angels and later in \"Alone on a Mountaintop\" (published in Lonesome Traveler) and The Dharma Bums.Kerouac would go on for hours, often drunk, to friends and strangers about his method. Allen Ginsberg, initially unimpressed, would later be one of his great proponents, and it was Kerouac's free-flowing prose method that inspired the composition of Ginsberg's poem Howl. It was at about the time of The Subterraneans that he was encouraged by Ginsberg and others to formally explain his style. Of his expositions of the Spontaneous Prose method, the most concise was Belief and Technique for Modern Prose, a list of 30 \"essentials\".\n\nSome believed that at times Kerouac's writing technique did not produce lively or energetic prose. Truman Capote said of it, \"That's not writing, it's typing\". According to Carolyn Cassady and others, he constantly rewrote and revised his work.Although the body of Kerouac's work has been published in English, in addition to his poetry and letters to friends and family, he also wrote unpublished works of fiction in French. The existence of his two novels written in French, La nuit est ma femme and Sur le chemin was revealed to the general public in a series of articles published by journalist Gabriel Anctil, in the Montreal newspaper Le Devoir in 2007 and 2008. All these works, including La nuit est ma femme, Sur le chemin, and large sections of Maggie Cassidy (originally written in French), have now been published together in a volume entitled La vie est d'hommage (Bor\u00e9al, 2016) edited by University of Pennsylvania professor Jean-Christophe Cloutier. In 1996, the Nouvelle Revue Fran\u00e7aise had already published excerpts and an article on \"La nuit est ma femme\", and scholar Paul Maher Jr., in his biography Kerouac: His Life and Work',  discussed Sur le chemin. The novella, completed in five days in Mexico during December 1952, is a telling example of Kerouac's attempts at writing in his first language, a language he often called Canuck French.\nKerouac refers to this short novel in a letter addressed to Neal Cassady (who is commonly known as the inspiration for the character Dean Moriarty) dated January 10, 1953. The published novel runs over 110 pages, having been reconstituted from six distinct files in the Kerouac archive by Professor Cloutier. Set in 1935, mostly on the East Coast, it explores some of the recurring themes of Kerouac's literature by way of a spoken word narrative. Here, as with most of his French writings, Kerouac writes with little regard for grammar or spelling, often relying on phonetics in order to render an authentic reproduction of the French-Canadian vernacular. Even though this work has the same title as one of his best known English novels, it is the original French version of an incomplete translation that later became Old Bull in the Bowery (now published in The Unknown Kerouac from the Library of America). The Unknown Kerouac, edited by Todd Tietchen, includes Cloutier's translation of La nuit est ma femme and the completed translation of Sur le Chemin under the title Old Bull in the Bowery. La nuit est ma femme was written in early 1951 and completed a few days or weeks before he began the original English version of On the Road, as many scholars, such as Paul Maher Jr., Joyce Johnson, Hassan Melehy, and Gabriel Anctil have pointed out.", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, around the time of the 20th anniversary of the film in 1996, Cohn revealed that it was actually a work of fiction.\nAfter persuading New York editor Clay Felker to let him write an article about the 1970s disco scene, Cohn, a newcomer to the United States, set about researching the American working-class subculture he was trying to cover. One night he travelled to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, to visit the disco 2001 Odyssey. However when he arrived a drunken fight was taking place outside the club, and one of the participants rolled over in the gutter and threw up on Cohn's trouser leg, leading him to return to Manhattan. Despite this brief visit, Cohn did notice that the scene was surveyed by one clubgoer standing in the doorway and calmly watching events. Cohn returned to the club subsequently but the young man was not there.To overcome his lack of familiarity with the New York disco scene, Cohn combined the image of the figure outside the club with people he knew from his youth, including a gang member from the Northern Ireland city of Derry, where Cohn had grown up, and a young man he knew in England. \"My story was a fraud\", he wrote. \"I'd only recently arrived in New York. Far from being steeped in Brooklyn street life, I hardly knew the place.

No way could it sneak past customs now. In the 60s and 70s, the line between fact and fiction was blurry... Few editors asked tough questions.

But that in my century I am the only person who knows the truth in the difficult science of colours\u2014of that, I say, I am not a little proud, and here I have a consciousness of a superiority to many.\nAlthough his literary work has attracted the most interest, Goethe was also keenly involved in studies of natural science. He wrote several works on morphology and colour theory. In the 1790s, he undertook Galvanic experiments and studied anatomical issues together with Alexander von Humboldt. He also had the largest private collection of minerals in all of Europe. By the time of his death, in order to gain a comprehensive view in geology, he had collected 17,800 rock samples.\nHis focus on morphology and what was later called homology influenced 19th-century naturalists, although his ideas of transformation were about the continuous metamorphosis of living things and did not relate to contemporary ideas of \"transformisme\" or transmutation of species. Homology, or as \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire called it \"analogie\", was used by Charles Darwin as strong evidence of common descent and of laws of variation. Goethe's studies (notably with an elephant's skull lent to him by Samuel Thomas von Soemmerring) led him to independently discover the human intermaxillary bone, also known as \"Goethe's bone\", in 1784, which Broussonet (1779) and Vicq d'Azyr (1780) had (using different methods) identified several years earlier. While not the only one in his time to question the prevailing view that this bone did not exist in humans, Goethe, who believed ancient anatomists had known about this bone, was the first to prove its existence in all mammals. The elephant's skull that led Goethe to this discovery, and was subsequently named the Goethean Elephant, still exists and is displayed in the Ottoneum in Kassel, Germany.\nDuring his Italian journey, Goethe formulated a theory of plant metamorphosis in which the archetypal form of the plant is to be found in the leaf \u2013 he writes, \"from top to bottom a plant is all leaf, united so inseparably with the future bud that one cannot be imagined without the other\". In 1790, he published his Metamorphosis of Plants. As one of the many precursors in the history of evolutionary thought, Goethe wrote in Story of My Botanical Studies (1831):\n\nThe ever-changing display of plant forms, which I have followed for so many years, awakens increasingly within me the notion: The plant forms which surround us were not all created at some given point in time and then locked into the given form, they have been given... a felicitous mobility and plasticity that allows them to grow and adapt themselves to many different conditions in many different places.\nGoethe's botanical theories were partly based on his gardening in Weimar.Goethe also popularized the Goethe barometer using a principle established by Torricelli. According to Hegel, \"Goethe has occupied himself a good deal with meteorology; barometer readings interested him particularly... What he says is important: the main thing is that he gives a comparative table of barometric readings during the whole month of December 1822, at Weimar, Jena, London, Boston, Vienna, T\u00f6pel... He claims to deduce from it that the barometric level varies in the same proportion not only in each zone but that it has the same variation, too, at different altitudes above sea-level\".\nIn 1810, Goethe published his Theory of Colours, which he considered his most important work. In it, he contentiously characterized colour as arising from the dynamic interplay of light and darkness through the mediation of a turbid medium. In 1816, Schopenhauer went on to develop his own theory in On Vision and Colours based on the observations supplied in Goethe's book. After being translated into English by Charles Eastlake in 1840, his theory became widely adopted by the art world, most notably J. M. W. Turner. Goethe's work also inspired the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, to write his Remarks on Colour. Goethe was vehemently opposed to Newton's analytic treatment of colour, engaging instead in compiling a comprehensive rational description of a wide variety of colour phenomena. Although the accuracy of Goethe's observations does not admit a great deal of criticism, his aesthetic approach did not lend itself to the demands of analytic and mathematical analysis used ubiquitously in modern Science. Goethe was, however, the first to systematically study the physiological effects of colour, and his observations on the effect of opposed colours led him to a symmetric arrangement of his colour wheel, \"for the colours diametrically opposed to each other ... are those which reciprocally evoke each other in the eye.\" In this, he anticipated Ewald Hering's opponent colour theory (1872).Goethe outlines his method in the essay The experiment as mediator between subject and object (1772). In the Kurschner edition of Goethe's works, the science editor, Rudolf Steiner, presents Goethe's approach to science as phenomenological. Steiner elaborated on that in the books The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception and Goethe's World View, in which he characterizes intuition as the instrument by which one grasps Goethe's biological archetype\u2014The Typus.\nNovalis, himself a geologist and mining engineer, expressed the opinion that Goethe was the first physicist of his time and \"epoch-making in the history of physics\", writing that Goethe's studies of light, of the metamorphosis of plants and of insects were indications and proofs \"that the perfect educational lecture belongs in the artist's sphere of work\"; and that Goethe would be surpassed \"but only in the way in which the ancients can be surpassed, in inner content and force, in variety and depth\u2014as an artist actually not, or only very little, for his rightness and intensity are perhaps already more exemplary than it would seem\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

While historian J. L. Granatstein wrote, \"Canada's military couldn't have carried on without the controversial policy\" and that \"[The conscripts] played a critical role in winning the war\", he also wrote that \"To achieve these ends, he almost broke the nation.\" In the 1917 federal election, in what was seen as a backlash against Borden and the Unionist Party's pro-conscription position, Quebec voted overwhelmingly in favour of the anti-conscription Laurier Liberals; the Unionists won only three seats. Historian Robert Craig Brown wrote, \"The political cost [of conscription] was enormous: the Conservative Party\u2019s support in Quebec was destroyed and would not be recovered for decades to come.\"Borden's opposition towards free trade and his government's reversal of a 1917 campaign promise to exempt the sons of farmers from conscription helped the agrarian Progressive Party grow in popularity, which was dissatisfied with Borden's positions on these issues. The Progressive Party was founded by Thomas Crerar, who was Borden's minister of agriculture until 1919, when he resigned over his opposition towards high tariffs and his belief that the government's budget did not pay enough attention to farmer's issues.

As the Reverend Robinson Duckworth rowed the boat, Dodgson regaled the girls with fantastic stories of a girl, named Alice, and her adventures after she fell into a rabbit-hole. The story was not unlike those Dodgson had spun for the sisters before, but this time Liddell asked Mr. Dodgson to write it down for her. He promised to do so but did not get around to the task for some months. He eventually presented her with the manuscript of Alice's Adventures Under Ground in November 1864.\n\nIn the meantime, Dodgson had decided to rewrite the story as a possible commercial venture. Probably with a view to canvassing his opinion, Dodgson sent the manuscript of Under Ground to a friend, the author George MacDonald, in the spring of 1863. The MacDonald children read the story and loved it, and this response probably persuaded Dodgson to seek a publisher. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, with illustrations by John Tenniel, was published in 1865, under the name Lewis Carroll.

The son of a Protestant landowner from East Prussia, he studied at the Munich Art Academy with Gabriel von Hackl from 1903. On 15 September 1910 in Frankfurt Franziska married Albert, who was by then employed as a freelancer at Margarete Steiff GmbH, for which he designed catalogs and numerous dolls and stuffed animals. In 1913, Franziska and Albert moved to Munich and settled in the Schwabing district. In May 1915 their daughter Irmgard Erika was born.\nAfter World War I, Franziska Schlopsnies began designing posters for fashion shows, department stores and exhibitions. One of her earliest surviving designs was made in 1920 for the Tietz department store. After the couple's divorce on 18 December 1922 she often signed her designs with the name \"Slopsnies\". From the mid-1920s, she preferred to draw figurines and costumes. Along with Doris Buscher, Liliane and Margaret von Suttner she was considered among the most important fashion illustrators. Her Art Deco-inspired fashion drawings and caricatures were regularly published in magazines, such as Jugend, Simplicissimus, Eleganten Welt, Berliner Illustrirten Zeitung, Sport im Bild and the monthly Velhagen & Klasings Monatshefte.

This would serve as the basis for creating Urusei Yatsura which was first published a year later when Takahashi was 21 years old. The series was her first major work, having previously only published short stories and is a combination of romantic comedy, science fiction, suburban life, and Japanese folktales. The title of the series is an untranslatable pun on the word urusai (\u3046\u308b\u3055\u3044), meaning \"noisy\" or \"obnoxious\", but written with the Chinese character for \"planet\"; the title can be translated roughly into English as \"Those Obnoxious Aliens\". The series first appeared in Shogakukan's Weekly Shonen Sunday in September 1978. At the start of the series it was only scheduled to run for 5 chapters. Ataru was the central character and each chapter would feature a different strange character. The character of Lum was only going to appear in the first chapter and was not in the second chapter; however, Takahashi decided to re-include her in the third chapter. The series was not an instant success and chapters were initially published sporadically. Between May and September 1978 she simultaneously worked on a series called Dust Spot; however, the increasing popularity of Urusei Yatsura caused her to focus on Urusei and the series became a regular serialization from the middle of 1979.Takahashi said that she had been dreaming about the overall universe of Urusei Yatsura since she was very young. She said that the series \"really includes everything I ever wanted to do. I love science fiction because sci-fi has tremendous flexibility. I adopted the science fiction-style for the series because then I could write any way I wanted to\". She wanted the reader to be completely surprised by the next panel and used slapstick comedy to create a reaction in the reader. When Takahashi ran out of ideas she would create new characters. Takahashi shared a small 150-square-foot apartment with her assistants, and slept in a closet due to a lack of space. While writing Urusei Yatsura she also began work on Maison Ikkoku and used this experience as well as her university experience as the basis for the setting of that series. Character names often carry extra meanings used to describe a characters personality or other traits. For example, the name Ataru Moroboshi refers to being hit by a star, a reference to the aliens and other people who gather around him. The name Shinobu suggests a patient character; however, this in contrast to the character's actual personality. In a similar way, the setting for the series is \"Tomobiki\", which means \"friend taking\". Tomobiki is also the name of a superstitious day in the old Japanese calendar system considered to have \"no winners or losers\" and occurred on every sixth day. Funerals rarely took place on this day as it was believed more deaths would soon follow. Lum was named after Agnes Lum, a bikini model during the 1970s. Lum's use of the English word \"Darling\" in reference to Ataru was to emphasize her status as a foreigner, as well as a play on the name Darrin, the husband figure from Bewitched.The characters of Megane, Perm, Kakugari and Chibi are recurring characters throughout the first anime adaptation; however, in the manga they are nameless fans of Lum who appear less after Mendo is introduced. In contrast the character Kosuke Shirai plays a large role in the manga, but does not appear in the first anime series. His role is often performed by Perm. The second half of the first anime adaptation is closer to the manga than the first half. In 2022, Takahashi said that Urusei Yatsura ended because she saw that Shinobu was happy after the character Inaba had been introduced. Takahashi has stated that she will not produce any more content for the series.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "1433_44", "question": "What was \"Until Grace\" published in?", "ctxs": [{"id": "69_3573", "text": "Kierkegaard published some of his works using pseudonyms and for others he signed his own name as author. Whether being published under pseudonym or not, Kierkegaard's central writing on religion was Fear and Trembling, and Either/Or is considered to be his magnum opus. Pseudonyms were used often in the early 19th century as a means of representing viewpoints other than the author's own. Kierkegaard employed the same technique as a way to provide examples of indirect communication. In writing under various pseudonyms to express sometimes contradictory positions, Kierkegaard is sometimes criticized for playing with various viewpoints without ever committing to one in particular. He has been described by those opposing his writings as indeterminate in his standpoint as a writer, though he himself has testified to all his work deriving from a service to Christianity. After On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates, his 1841 master's thesis under Frederik Christian Sibbern, he wrote his first book under the pseudonym \"Johannes Climacus\" (after John Climacus) between 1841 and 1842. De omnibus dubitandum est (Latin: \"Everything must be doubted\") was not published until after his death.\nKierkegaard's magnum opus Either/Or was published 20 February 1843; it was mostly written during Kierkegaard's stay in Berlin, where he took notes on Schelling's Philosophy of Revelation. Either/Or includes essays of literary and music criticism and a set of romantic-like aphorisms, as part of his larger theme of examining the reflective and philosophical structure of faith. Edited by \"Victor Eremita\", the book contained the papers of an unknown \"A\" and \"B\" which the pseudonymous author claimed to have discovered in a secret drawer of his secretary. Eremita had a hard time putting the papers of \"A\" in order because they were not straightforward. \"B\"'s papers were arranged in an orderly fashion. Both of these characters are trying to become religious individuals. Each approached the idea of first love from an aesthetic and an ethical point of view. The book is basically an argument about faith and marriage with a short discourse at the end telling them they should stop arguing. Eremita thinks \"B\", a judge, makes the most sense. Kierkegaard stressed the \"how\" of Christianity as well as the \"how\" of book reading in his works rather than the \"what\".Three months after the publication of Either/Or, 16 May 1843, he published Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 and continued to publish discourses along with his pseudonymous books. These discourses were published under Kierkegaard's own name and are available as Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses today. David F. Swenson first translated the works in the 1940s and titled them the Edifying Discourses; however, in 1990, Howard V. and Edna H. Hong translated the works again but called them the Upbuilding Discourses. The word \"upbuilding\" was more in line with Kierkegaard's thought after 1846, when he wrote Christian deliberations about Works of Love. An upbuilding discourse or edifying discourse isn't the same as a sermon because a sermon is preached to a congregation while a discourse can be carried on between several people or even with oneself. The discourse or conversation should be \"upbuilding\", which means one would build up the other person, or oneself, rather than tear down to build up. Kierkegaard said: \"Although this little book (which is called 'discourses', not sermons, because its author does not have authority to preach, 'upbuilding discourses', not discourses for upbuilding, because the speaker by no means claims to be a teacher) wishes to be only what it is, a superfluity, and desires only to remain in hiding\".On 16 October 1843, Kierkegaard published three more books about love and faith and several more discourses. Fear and Trembling was published under the pseudonym Johannes de Silentio. Repetition is about a Young Man (S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard) who has anxiety and depression because he feels he has to sacrifice his love for a girl (Regine Olsen) to God. He tries to see if the new science of psychology can help him understand himself. Constantin Constantius, who is the pseudonymous author of that book, is the psychologist. At the same time, he published Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 under his own name, which dealt specifically with how love can be used to hide things from yourself or others. These three books, all published on the same day, are an example of Kierkegaard's method of indirect communication.\nKierkegaard questioned whether an individual can know if something is a good gift from God or not and concludes by saying, \"it does not depend, then, merely upon what one sees, but what one sees depends upon how one sees; all observation is not just a receiving, a discovering, but also a bringing forth, and insofar as it is that, how the observer himself is constituted is indeed decisive.\" God's love is imparted indirectly just as our own sometimes is.During 1844, he published two, three, and four more upbuilding discourses just as he did in 1843, but here he discussed how an individual might come to know God. Theologians, philosophers and historians were all engaged in debating about the existence of God. This is direct communication and Kierkegaard thinks this might be useful for theologians, philosophers, and historians (associations) but not at all useful for the \"single individual\" who is interested in becoming a Christian. Kierkegaard always wrote for \"that single individual whom I with joy and gratitude call my reader\"; the single individual must put what is understood to use or it will be lost. Reflection can take an individual only so far before the imagination begins to change the whole content of what was being thought about. Love is won by being exercised just as much as faith and patience are.\nHe also wrote several more pseudonymous books in 1844: Philosophical Fragments, Prefaces and The Concept of Anxiety and finished the year up with Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1844. He used indirect communication in the first book and direct communication in the rest of them. He doesn't believe the question about God's existence should be an opinion held by one group and differently by another no matter how many demonstrations are made. He says it's up to the single individual to make the fruit of the Holy Spirit real because love and joy are always just possibilities. Christendom wanted to define God's attributes once and for all but Kierkegaard was against this. His love for Regine was a disaster but it helped him because of his point of view.Kierkegaard believed \"each generation has its own task and need not trouble itself unduly by being everything to previous and succeeding generations\". In an earlier book he had said, \"to a certain degree every generation and every individual begins his life from the beginning\", and in another, \"no generation has learned to love from another, no generation is able to begin at any other point than the beginning\", \"no generation learns the essentially human from a previous one.\" And, finally, in 1850 he wrote, \"those true Christians who in every generation live a life contemporaneous with that of Christ have nothing whatsoever to do with Christians of the preceding generation, but all the more with their contemporary, Christ. His life here on earth attends every generation, and every generation severally, as Sacred History...\" But in 1848, \"The whole generation and every individual in the generation is a participant in one's having faith.\"\nHe was against the Hegelian idea of mediation because it introduces a \"third term\" that comes between the single individual and the object of desire. Kierkegaard wrote in 1844, 'If a person can be assured of the grace of God without needing temporal evidence as a middleman or as the dispensation advantageous to him as interpreter, then it is indeed obvious to him that the grace of God is the most glorious of all.\" He was against mediation and settled instead on the choice to be content with the grace of God or not. It's the choice between the possibility of the \"temporal and the eternal\", \"mistrust and belief, and deception and truth\", \"subjective and objective\". These are the \"magnitudes\" of choice. He always stressed deliberation and choice in his writings and wrote against comparison. This is how Kant put it in 1786 and Kierkegaard put it in 1847: Thinking for one's self is to seek the chief touchstone of truth in one's self (id est, in one's own reason); and the maxim, to think for one's self at all times is Enlightening. Thereto belongs not just so much, as those may imagine who take knowledge, to be enlightening; as it is rather a negative principle in the use of one's cognoscitive faculty, and he, who is very rich in knowledge, is often the least enlightened in the use of it. To exercise one's own reason, means nothing more, than, relatively to every thing which one is to suppose, to question one's self.\nWorldly worry always seeks to lead a human being into the small-minded unrest of comparisons, away from the lofty calmness of simple thoughts. To be clothed, then, means to be a human being\u2014and therefore to be well clothed. Worldly worry is preoccupied with clothes and dissimilarity of clothes.  Should not the invitation to learn from the lilies be welcome to everyone just as the reminder is useful to him! Alas, those great, uplifting, simple thoughts, those first thoughts, are more and more forgotten, perhaps entirely forgotten in the weekday and worldly life of comparisons. The one human being compares himself with others, the one generation compares itself with the other, and thus the heaped up pile of comparisons overwhelms a person. As the ingenuity and busyness increase, there come to be more and more in each generation who slavishly work a whole lifetime far down in the low underground regions of comparisons. Indeed, just as miners never see the light of day, so these unhappy people never come to see the light: those uplifting, simple thoughts, those first thoughts about how glorious it is to be a human being. And up there in the higher regions of comparison, smiling vanity plays its false game and deceives the happy ones so that they receive no impression from those lofty, simple thoughts, those first thoughts.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "1433_45", "question": "What larger work was \"O Captain! My Captain!\" published in?", "ctxs": [{"id": "1433_69170", "text": "The poem was Whitman's most popular during his lifetime, and the only one to be anthologized before his death. The historian Michael C. Cohen noted that \"My Captain\" was \"carried beyond the limited circulation of Leaves of Grass and into the popular heart\"; its popularity remade \"history in the form of a ballad\". Initial reception to the poem was very positive. In early 1866, a reviewer in the Boston Commonwealth wrote that the poem was the most moving dirge for Lincoln ever written, adding that Drum Taps \"will do much [...] to remove the prejudice against Mr. Whitman in many minds\". Similarly, after reading Sequel to Drum Taps, the author William Dean Howells became convinced that Whitman had cleaned the \"old channels of their filth\" and poured \"a stream of blameless purity\" through; he would become a prominent defender of Whitman. One of the earliest criticisms of the poem was authored by Edward P. Mitchell in 1881 who considered the rhymes \"crude\". \"My Captain\" is considered uncharacteristic of Whitman's poetry, and it was praised initially as a departure from his typical style. Author Julian Hawthorne wrote in 1891 that the poem was touching partially because it was such a stylistic departure. In 1892, The Atlantic wrote that \"My Captain\" was universally accepted as Whitman's \"one great contribution to the world's literature\", and George Rice Carpenter, a scholar and biographer of Whitman, said in 1903 that the poem was possibly the best work of Civil War poetry, praising its imagery as \"beautiful\".Reception remained positive into the early 20th century. Epstein considers it to have been one of the ten most popular English language poems of the 20th century. In his book Canons by Consensus, Joseph Csicsila reached a similar conclusion, noting that the poem was \"one of the two or three most highly praised of Whitman's poems during the 1920s and 1930s\"; he also wrote that the poem's verse form and emotional sincerity appealed to \"more conservative-minded critics\". In 1916, Henry B. Rankin, a biographer of Lincoln, wrote that \"My Captain\" became \"the nation's\u2014aye, the world's\u2014funeral dirge of our First American\". The Literary Digest in 1919 deemed it the \"most likely to live forever\" of Whitman's poems, and the 1936 book American Life in Literature went further, describing it as the best American poem. Author James O'Donnell Bennett echoed that, writing that the poem represented a perfect \"threnody\", or mourning poem. The poem was not unanimously praised during this period: one critic wrote that \"My Captain\" was \"more suitable for recitation before an enthusiastically uncritical audience than for its place in the Oxford Book of English Verse\".Beginning in the 1920s, Whitman became increasingly respected by critics, and by 1950 he was one of the most prominent American authors. Poetry anthologies began to include poetry that was considered more \"authentic\" to Whitman's poetic style, and, as a result, \"My Captain\" became less popular. In an analysis of poetry anthologies, Joseph Csicsila found that, although \"My Captain\" had been Whitman's most frequently published poem, shortly after the end of World War II it \"all but disappeared\" from American anthologies, and had \"virtually disappeared\" after 1966. William E. Barton wrote in Abraham Lincoln and Walt Whitman, published in 1965, that the poem was \"the least like Whitman of anything Whitman ever wrote; yet it is his highest literary monument\".Critical opinion of the poem began to shift in the middle of the 20th century. In 1980, Whitman's biographer Justin Kaplan called the poem \"thoroughly conventional\". The literary critic F. O. Matthiessen criticized the poem, writing in 1941 that its early popularity was an \"ample and ironic comment\" on how Whitman's more authentic poetry could not reach a wide audience. Michael C. Cohen, a literature professor, said Matthiessen's writing exemplified 20th-century opinion on the poem. In the 1997 book A Reader's Guide to Walt Whitman, scholar Gay Wilson Allen concluded that the poem's symbols were \"trite\", the rhythm \"artificial\", and the rhymes \"erratic\".Negative perspectives on the poem continued into the 21st century. In 2000, Helen Vendler wrote that because Whitman \"was bent on registering individual response as well as the collective wish expressed in 'Hush'd be the camps', he took on the voice of a single representative sailor silencing his own idiosyncratic voice\". Elsewhere, she states that two \"stylistic features\u2014its meter and its use of refrain\u2014mark 'O Captain' as a designedly democratic and populist poem\". Four years later, Epstein wrote that he struggled to believe that the same writer wrote both \"Lilacs\" and \"O Captain! My Captain!\". Poet Robert Pinsky told the New York Times News Service in 2009 that he considered the poem \"not very good\", and a year later another poet, C. K. Williams, concluded that the poem was a \"truly awful piece of near doggerel triteness\" that deserved derisive criticism. Meanwhile, the 2004 Oxford Encyclopedia of American Literature entry on Whitman suggests that critiques about the poem's rhythm are unfair.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "1433_49", "question": "What was \"The Boarding House\" published in?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_19744", "text": "Like many of Pinter's other plays, very little of the expository information in The Birthday Party is verifiable; it is contradicted by the characters and otherwise ambiguous, and, therefore, one cannot take what they say at face value. For example, in Act One, Stanley describes his career, saying \"I've played the piano all over the world,\" reduces that immediately to \"All over the country,\" and then, after a pause, undercuts both statements by saying \"I once gave a concert.\"While the title and the dialogue refer to Meg's planning a party to celebrate Stanley's birthday: \"It's your birthday, Stan. I was going to keep it a secret until tonight,\" even that fact is dubious, as Stanley denies that it is his birthday: \"This isn't my birthday, Meg\" (48), telling Goldberg and McCann: \"Anyway, this isn't my birthday...No, it's not until next month,\" adding, in response to McCann's saying \"Not according to the lady [Meg],\" \"Her? She's crazy. Round the bend\" (53).\nAlthough Meg claims that her house is a boarding house, her husband Petey, who was confronted by two men who \"wanted to know if we could put them up for a couple of nights\" is surprised that Meg already has prepared a room (23) and Stanley (being the only supposed boarder) also responds to what appears to him to be the sudden appearance of Goldberg and McCann as prospective guests on a supposed short holiday, flat out denies that it is a boarding house: \"This is a ridiculous house to pick on...Because it's not a boarding house. It never was.\" (53)\nMcCann claims to have no knowledge of Stanley or Maidenhead when Stanley asks him \"Ever been anywhere near Maidenhead?...There's a Fuller's teashop. I used to have my tea there...and a Boots Library. I seem to connect you with the High Street...A charming town, don't you think?...A quiet, thriving community. I was born and brought up there. I lived well away from the main road\" (51); yet Goldberg later names both businesses that Stanley used to frequent connecting Goldberg and possibly also McCann to Maidenhead: \"A little Austin, tea in Fuller's a library book from Boots, and I'm satisfied\" (70). Of course, both Stanley and Goldberg could just be inventing these apparent reminiscences as they both appear to have invented other details about their lives earlier, and here Goldberg could conveniently be lifting details from Stanley's earlier own mention of them, which he has heard; as Merritt observes, the factual basis for such apparent correspondences in the dialogue uttered by Pinter's characters remains ambiguous and subject to multiple interpretations.Shifting identities (cf. \"the theme of identity\") makes the past ambiguous: Goldberg is called \"Nat,\" but in his stories of the past he says that he was called \"Simey\" (73) and also \"Benny\" (92), and he refers to McCann as both \"Dermot\" (in talking to Petey [87]) and \"Seamus\" (in talking to McCann [93]). Given such contradictions, these characters' actual names and thus identities remain unclear. According to John Russell Brown (94), \"Falsehoods are important for Pinter's dialogue, not least when they can be detected only by careful reference from one scene to another...Some of the more blatant lies are so casually delivered that the audience is encouraged to look for more than is going to be disclosed. This is a part of Pinter's two-pronged tactic of awakening the audience's desire for verification and repeatedly disappointing this desire\" (Brown 94).Although Stanley, just before the lights go out during the birthday party, begins to strangle Meg (78), she has no memory of that the next morning, quite possibly because she had drunk too much (71\u201374); oblivious to the fact that Goldberg and McCann have removed Stanley from the house \u2013 Petey keeps that information from her when she inquires, \"Is he still in bed?\" by answering \"Yes, he's...still asleep\"\u2013\u2013she ends the play focusing on herself and romanticising her role in the party, \"I was the belle of the ball...I know I was\u201d (102). For some, Petey\u2019s final reply only makes dramatic sense if the framework of the whole play is in Meg\u2019s mind, that her invention of Stan was necessary in an empty marriage, and what the audience has seen was a tragic possibility - no doubt to be followed by another narrative when her Stan arrives.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "1433_50", "question": "What larger work was \"If\u2014\" published in?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_19871", "text": "Noah Webster's main competitor was a man named Joseph Emerson Worcester, whose 1830 Comprehensive Pronouncing and Explanatory Dictionary of the English Language brought accusations of plagiarism from Webster. The rivalry was carried on by Merriam after Webster's death, in what is often referred to as the \"Dictionary Wars\". After Worcester's death in 1865, revision of his Dictionary of the English Language was soon discontinued and it eventually went out of print.\nThe American edition of Charles Annandale's four volume revision of The Imperial Dictionary of the English Language, published in 1883 by the Century Company, was more comprehensive than the Unabridged. The Century Dictionary, an expansion of the Imperial first published from 1889 to 1891, covered a larger vocabulary until the publication of Webster's Second in 1934, after the Century had ceased publication.\nIn 1894 came Funk & Wagnalls Standard Dictionary, an attractive one volume counterpart to Webster's International. The expanded New Standard of 1913 was a worthy challenge to the New International, and remained a major competitor for many years. However, Funk & Wagnalls never revised the work, reprinting it virtually unchanged for more than 50 years, while Merriam published two major revisions.\nThe Oxford English Dictionary (OED), which published its complete first edition in 1933, challenged Merriam in scholarship, though not in the marketplace due to its much larger size. The New International editions continued to offer words and features not covered by the OED, and vice versa. In the 1970s, the OED began publishing Supplements to its dictionary and in 1989 integrated the new words in the supplements with the older definitions and etymologies in its Second Edition.\nBetween the 1930s and the 1950s, several college dictionaries, notably the American College Dictionary and (non-Merriam) Webster's New World Dictionary, entered the market alongside the Collegiate. Among larger dictionaries during this period was (non-Merriam) Webster's Universal Dictionary (also published as Webster's Twentieth Century Dictionary) which traced its roots to Noah Webster and called itself \"unabridged\", but had less than half the vocabulary and paled in scholarship against the Merriam editions.\nAfter the commercial success of Webster's Third New International in the 1960s, Random House responded by adapting its college dictionary by adding more illustrations and large numbers of proper names, increasing its print size and page thickness, and giving it a heavy cover. In 1966, it was published as a new \"unabridged\" dictionary. It was expanded in 1987, but it still covered no more than half the actual vocabulary of Webster's Third.\nThe American Heritage Publishing Co., highly critical of Webster's Third, failed in an attempt to buy out Merriam-Webster and determined to create its own dictionary, The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. In 1969, it issued a college-sized dictionary. Now in its fifth edition, it is only slightly greater in vocabulary than the Collegiate, but it appears much larger and has the appeal of many pictures and other features, such as a usage panel of language professionals which is polled for the acceptability of certain word usage, and a discussion for some entries of subtle differences among words with similar meaning. Other medium-sized dictionaries have since entered the market, including the New Oxford American and the Encarta Webster's, while Merriam-Webster has not attempted to compete by issuing a similar edition.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She learns that it belongs to an artist named Maara (R. Madhavan) who is responsible for the paintings across the village. Maara is a free spirit and traveller who is often away visiting various places and returning as he pleases. When she starts cleaning up the place, she finds Maara's photo and a sketchbook. The sketches depict the previous New Year's Eve when a small-time thief (Alexander Babu) tried to rob Maara. In a turn-of-events, Maara joins the thief, and they both go on the rooftop of a home with a plan to rob the place. There, they see a woman about to shoot herself. The sketchbook ends there, and the story is left unfinished, which piques Paaru's curiosity about the rest of the story, and Maara as a person.\nIntrigued, Paaru starts finding the people in Maara's sketches. Backtracking his steps, she meets an antique dealer, Usman bhai, a \u201cpirate\u201d, Chokku and learns about Selvi (Abhirami), a physically abused woman that Maara had known.

He informs her that Maara stopped the woman from shooting herself, and followed her when she started to run away from him. They find the house and finally identify the woman as Doctor Kani (Sshivada). Paaru then tracks her to a mountain village and enquires about her story. Kani explains that when she performed her first independent operation as a paediatrician, a surgical error led to the death of a 10-year-old girl. Further slandered by the media, she was desperate and about to commit suicide on New Year's Eve when she was by chance, stopped by Maara. Maara then brings her to his mountain village, maintained by Vellaiya (Moulee), his foster father, and she has since been living there.

Vellaiya constantly tells the story of acting out a play to convey his love to Meenakshi, and eventually losing her when a storm flooded his home village.\nWhen Vellaiya shows Paaru a photo of Meenakshi, she notices that she has on the same pendant of a conch as her aunt, Mary, who is a nurse at a convent. She brings her Aunt Mary to the village on Vellaiya's birthday, realising that the plot of his play is the fairy-tale she had heard as a child from Aunt Mary - a story of an immortal soldier who spends years looking for his beloved mystical fish. An emotional Velliya, who has spent all his adult life travelling from place to place in search of Meenakshi, thanks Paaru for fulfilling Velliya's wish.

One day and without warning, he finds himself summoned to the mysterious world of M\u00c4R Heaven, which he has only seen before in his dreams and in his mother's books. In this fairy tale world, Ginta's physical weakness is replaced with superior physical strength, incredible stamina and endurance, being able to see without his glasses.\nUpon meeting a mysterious 16-year-old witch named Dorothy, Ginta is introduced to the powerful magical accessories and weapons called \"\u00c4RMs\". Dorothy plans to steal the mysterious \u00c4RM Babbo, from a trap-guarded cave, and brings Ginta along to assist her, intrigued by his unusual strength and abilities. Babbo is revealed to be an extremely special and unique \u00c4RM, as he possesses a will of his own and the ability to speak. Displeased with the fact that Babbo is so cumbersome, Dorothy gives Babbo to Ginta instead, departing with a warning that others will try to steal Babbo from him.\nGinta continues on a journey of discovery, reveling in this new world. When Ginta encounters the farmer Jack and his mother, who are troubled by two werewolf brothers, he finds that he misses the real world. Ginta resolves to find a way to reach home while enjoying as much of M\u00c4R as he can along the way, with Jack journeying with him. However, it is not long before Ginta learns that the world of M\u00c4R Heaven is not as peaceful as it seems when he is attacked by thieves wishing to steal Babbo.\nUpon meeting a boy named Alviss, who summoned him to M\u00c4R Heaven using an \u00c4RM known as the Gate Keeper Clown, Ginta learns of the sinister Chess Pieces, an organization who tried to take over M\u00c4R Heaven six years earlier. Alviss reveals that he summoned Ginta in order to gain assistance from an \"other-worlder\" in the upcoming war, as was done previously, and that Babbo originally belonged to one of the knights of the Chess Pieces.

Kai idolizes Ginta and dreams of having an \u00c4RM for himself, despite not having magic power. Kai, however, inherited a magic stone from his dead parents; a memento that suggests his family's relation to the sorcerer kingdom of Caldia, birthplace of all \u00c4RMs and magic users. At the time throughout M\u00c4R-Heaven, a new type of \u00c4RM, known as \"Fake \u00c4RM\", which is activated without magic power, became highly used.\nOn an errand, Kai is suddenly attacked by a remnant of the Chess Pieces. Kai jumps into a pond, where he meets Babbo. Using the \u00c4RM, Kai defeats the Chess Piece. Babbo wonders how Kai was able to use him, being a normal boy with no powers. Kai returns to his home alongside Babbo. Upon returning, Kai discovers that the Fake \u00c4RM users are possessed and want to take Babbo to bring him to a sinister mysterious figure who was watching them the whole time. Alviss comes to help and reveals that the Fake \u00c4RMs absorb the life energy from their users, allowing to control their minds in the process.\nKai, alongside Babbo, Alviss and his friend Elise, go to Caldia to seek help. They are welcomed into the Grand Elder's palace by Dorothy and a young wizard, Inga. The Grand Elder tells them that over 300 years ago the Fake \u00c4RMs were created by a dark magician, Unwetter, who experimented with the human mind manipulation. Babbo, the Elder of Caldia at the time, defeated him, consigning him and his malicious creations into oblivion, just before dying, transferring his soul into the \u00c4RM and erasing every memory related to the incident.\nThe Grand Elder does not know, however, why the supposedly sealed Fake \u00c4RMs were once again spread throughout M\u00c4R Heaven, how the supposedly dead Unwetter could have been revived or what his goals are. The Grand Elder decides to seal Babbo to avoid more trouble, to which Kai disagrees. The Grand Elder orders Kai to prove himself worthy of wielding Babbo.

PM was conceived as a sequel to Russell's 1903 The Principles of Mathematics, but as PM states, this became an unworkable suggestion for practical and philosophical reasons: \"The present work was originally intended by us to be comprised in a second volume of Principles of Mathematics... But as we advanced, it became increasingly evident that the subject is a very much larger one than we had supposed; moreover on many fundamental questions which had been left obscure and doubtful in the former work, we have now arrived at what we believe to be satisfactory solutions.\"\nPM, according to its introduction, had three aims: (1) to analyze to the greatest possible extent the ideas and methods of mathematical logic and to minimize the number of primitive notions, axioms, and inference rules; (2) to precisely express mathematical propositions in symbolic logic using the most convenient notation that precise expression allows; (3) to solve the paradoxes that plagued logic and set theory at the turn of the 20th century, like Russell's paradox.This third aim motivated the adoption of the theory of types in PM. The theory of types adopts grammatical restrictions on formulas that rules out the unrestricted comprehension of classes, properties, and functions. The effect of this is that formulas such as would allow the comprehension of objects like the Russell set turn out to be ill-formed: they violate the grammatical restrictions of the system of PM.\nPM sparked interest in symbolic logic and advanced the subject, popularizing it and demonstrating its power.

In this work, Mauss and Durkheim attempted to create a French version of the sociology of knowledge, illustrating the various paths of human thought taken by different cultures, in particular how space and time are connected back to societal patterns. They focused their study on tribal societies in order to achieve depth.\nWhile Mauss called himself a Durkheimian, he interpreted the school of Durkheim as his own. His early works reflect the dependence on Durkheim's school, yet as more works, including unpublished texts were read, Mauss preferred to start many projects and often not finish them. Mauss concerned himself more with politics than his uncle, as a member of the Collectivistes, French workers party, and Revolutionary socialist workers party. His political involvement led up to and after World War I.The Gift\nMauss has been credited for his analytic framework which has been characterized as more supple, more appropriate for the application of empirical studies, and more fruitful than his earlier studies with Durkheim. His work fell into two categories, one being major ethnological works on exchange as a symbolic system, body techniques and the category of the person, and the second being social science methodology. In his classic work The Gift [see external links for PDF], Mauss argued that gifts are never truly free, rather, human history is full of examples of gifts bringing about reciprocal exchange. The famous question that drove his inquiry into the anthropology of the gift was: \"What power resides in the object given that causes its recipient to pay it back?\". The answer is simple: the gift is a \"total prestation\" (see law of obligations), imbued with \"spiritual mechanisms\", engaging the honour of both giver and receiver (the term \"total prestation\" or \"total social fact\" (fait social total) was coined by his student Maurice Leenhardt after Durkheim's social fact). Such transactions transcend the divisions between the spiritual and the material in a way that, according to Mauss, is almost \"magical\". The giver does not merely give an object but also part of himself, for the object is indissolubly tied to the giver: \"the objects are never completely separated from the men who exchange them\" (1990:31). \nBecause of this bond between giver and gift, the act of giving creates a social bond with an obligation to reciprocate on the part of the recipient. Not to reciprocate means to lose honour and status, but the spiritual implications can be even worse: in Polynesia, failure to reciprocate means to lose mana, one's spiritual source of authority and wealth. To cite Goldman-Ida's summary, \"Mauss distinguished between three obligations: giving, the necessary initial step for the creation and maintenance of social relationships; receiving, for to refuse to receive is to reject the social bond; and reciprocating in order to demonstrate one's own liberality, honour, and wealth\" (2018:341). Mauss describes how society is blinded by ideology, and therefore a system of prestations survives in societies when regarding the economy. Institutions are founded on the unity of individuals and society, and capitalism rests on an unsustainable influence on an individual's wants. Rather than focusing on money, Mauss describes the need to focus on faits sociaux totaux, total social facts, which are legal, economic, religious, and aesthetic facts which challenge the sociological method.An important notion in Mauss's conceptualization of gift exchange is what Gregory (1982, 1997) refers to as \"inalienability\". In a commodity economy, there is a strong distinction between objects and persons through the notion of private property. Objects are sold, meaning that the ownership rights are fully transferred to the new owner. The object has thereby become \"alienated\" from its original owner. In a gift economy, however, the objects that are given are unalienated from the givers; they are \"loaned rather than sold and ceded\". It is the fact that the identity of the giver is invariably bound up with the object given that causes the gift to have a power which compels the recipient to reciprocate. Because gifts are unalienable they must be returned; the act of giving creates a gift-debt that has to be repaid. Because of this, the notion of an expected return of the gift creates a relationship over time between two individuals. In other words, through gift-giving, a social bond evolves that is assumed to continue through space and time until the future moment of exchange. Gift exchange therefore leads to a mutual interdependence between giver and receiver. According to Mauss, the \"free\" gift that is not returned is a contradiction because it cannot create social ties. Following the Durkheimian quest for understanding social cohesion through the concept of solidarity, Mauss's argument is that solidarity is achieved through the social bonds created by gift exchange. Mauss emphasizes that exchanging gifts resulted from the will of attaching other people \u2013 'to put people under obligations', because \"in theory such gifts are voluntary, but in fact they are given and repaid under obligation\".Mauss and Hubert\nMauss also focused on the topic of sacrifice. The book Sacrifice and its Function which he wrote with Henri Hubert in 1899 argued that sacrifice is a process involving sacralising and desacralising. This was when the \"former directed the holy towards the person or object, and the latter away from a person or object.\" Mauss and Hubert proposed that the body is better understood not as a natural given. Instead, it should be seen as the product of specific training in attributes, deportments, and habits. Furthermore, the body techniques are biological, sociological, and psychological and in doing an analysis of the body, one must apprehend these elements simultaneously. They defined the person as a category of thought, the articulation of particular embodiment of law and morality. Mauss and Hubert believed that a person was constituted by personages (a set of roles) which were executed through the behaviors and exercise of specific body techniques and attributes.\n\nMauss and Hubert wrote another book titled A General Theory of Magic in 1902 [see external links for PDF]. They studied magic in 'primitive' societies and how it has manifested into our thoughts and social actions. They argue that social facts are subjective and therefore should be considered magic, but society is not open to accepting this. In the book, Mauss and Hubert state: \"In magic, we have officers, actions, and representations: we call a person who accomplishes magical actions a magician, even if he is not professional; magical representations are those ideas and beliefs which correspond to magical actions; as for these actions, with regard to which we have defined the other elements of magic, we shall call them magical rites. At this stage it is important to distinguish between these activities and other social practices with which they might be confused.\"They go on to say that only social occurrences can be considered magical. Individual actions are not magic because if the whole community does not believe in efficacy of a group of actions, it is not social and therefore, cannot be magical.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It tells the story of Nausica\u00e4, a princess of a small kingdom on a post-apocalyptic Earth with a toxic ecosystem, who becomes involved in a war between kingdoms while an environmental disaster threatens humankind.\nPrior to creating Nausica\u00e4, Miyazaki had worked as an animator for Toei Animation, Nippon Animation and Tokyo Movie Shinsha (TMS), the latter for whom he had directed his feature directorial debut, Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro (1979). After working on an aborted film adaptation of Richard Corben's comic book Rowlf for TMS, he agreed to create a manga series for Tokuma Shoten's monthly magazine Animage, initially on the condition that it would not be adapted into a film. The development of Nausica\u00e4 was influenced by the Japanese Heian period tale The Lady who Loved Insects, a similarly-named character from Homer's epic poem Odyssey and the Minamata Bay mercury pollution. The setting and visual style of the manga was influenced by M\u0153bius. It was serialized intermittently in Animage from February 1982 to March 1994 and the individual chapters were collected and published by Tokuma Shoten in seven tank\u014dbon volumes. It was serialized with an English translation in North America by Viz Media from 1988 to 1996 as a series of 27 comic book issues and has been published in collected form multiple times.\nSince its initial serialization, Nausica\u00e4 has become a commercial success, particularly in Japan, where the series has more than 17 million copies in circulation. The manga and the 1984 film adaptation, written and directed by Miyazaki and released following the serialization of the manga's first sixteen chapters, received universal acclaim from critics and scholars for its characters, themes, and art. The manga and film versions of Nausica\u00e4 are also credited for the foundation of Studio Ghibli, the animation studio for which Miyazaki created several of his most recognized works.", "hasanswer": true}]}

He contemplated this, since he had to design a long-running series instead of the autoconclusive short stories that he had been developing until that point. He accepted, and the series became Nagai's first big success when Sh\u014dnen Jump sold more than one million copies. With Harenchi Gakuen, Nagai became the originator of ecchi manga, opened the door for a series of taboo-shattering gag comics, and also became the symbol of an entire generation. This work has influenced the world of manga, effecting both social mores and what was considered appropriate for manga.Harenchi Gakuen started with the idea of making a manga around a school. Nagai liked the word \"Harenchi\" (scandal), which was used commonly to advertise adult movies. For him, scandal and school were like oil and water, and he thought that mixing them would be funny. At first, Nagai did not have an idea of what stories to develop, but his assistant at the time was boasting about how he had peeped on the girls during their physical examinations from a hole in the roof of his school; this idea was developed into the plot of the manga. Originally, open erotic references did not appear in Harenchi Gakuen. The first physical examination scenes only showed from the shoulders up, but there were a lot of girls drawn, and their images became popular. The editor asked Nagai to go further, which Nagai was eager to do.The inspiration for Harenchi Gakuen came from the West. Nagai liked foreign movies and used to read Playboy magazine and other erotic magazines when he was a child. For the depiction of breasts, he took particular inspiration from the Venus de Milo. According to Nagai, what he in fact drew was not about eroticism per se, but about Japan's culture of shame. He wanted embarrassment to be the eroticism of the stories.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Fischer Verlag and in 2007 in English by Macmillan as The Himmler Brothers: A German Family History.\nHer book traces the lives of the three Himmler brothers (the eldest was Gebhard Himmler), the sons of a respected secondary school headmaster in Munich. Gebhard served in the German Army in World War I, but Heinrich, who at 18 was still an officer cadet when the war ended, was too young to see frontline service. Katrin Himmler speculates that it was frustration at this and envy of his brother that led Heinrich to join the extreme right-wing Freikorps in 1919. In the Freikorps he served under Ernst R\u00f6hm and was thus led into the Nazi Party.\nDespite her family being told her grandfather Ernst had had no interest in politics, Katrin discovered that he was an enthusiastic Nazi who had joined the party in 1931, and was also an officer in the Schutzstaffel (SS). Ernst was killed in the fighting in Berlin in May 1945.\n\"Many times during my research it was quite difficult for me to go on,\" Himmler told an interviewer in August 2007. \"As things were revealed it became more and more shocking. We descendents were left in no doubt about what Heinrich had done. But his actions cast a large shadow that the rest of the family were standing in, many of them hiding in there.\"Her most disturbing discovery was that her grandfather had directly caused the deportation and death of a Jewish engineer, a Major Schmidt, deputy manager of an engineering firm, who had been protected because of his expertise. Writing to Heinrich, Ernst dismissed his usefulness, knowing that he would then be reclassified and deported to a labour camp.\nJustin Cartwright, reviewing the book for The Daily Telegraph, commented: \"As Katrin Himmler writes, it would have been perfectly possible for him [Ernst] to have supported Schmidt without any danger to himself as the brother of the Reichsf\u00fchrer. For her this was a turning point: she realised once and for all just how deeply her grandfather and her great-uncle Gebhard were in thrall to their brother's murderous racial policies.\"Doug Johnstone wrote in The List: \"Katrin's book is admirably level-headed, a meticulous memoir of an extraordinary family, and the author never resorts to histrionics, preferring to let the facts speak for themselves. Originally written as self-therapy, the book stands as a testament to the enduring legacy of guilt the Nazis left behind for future generations.\"Robert Hawks, however, wrote in The Independent: \"Katrin does try to turn some equivocal evidence into revelations of her family's complicity, but her prosecutorial stance gets in the way of empathy.

The main branch of the movement, Chabad-Lubavitch, has had seven rebbes:\n\nRabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi (1745\u20131812), founded the Chabad movement in the town of Liozna. The Chabad movement began as a separate school of thought within the Hasidic movement, focusing of the spread of Hasidic mystical teachings using logical reasoning (creating a kind of Jewish \"rational-mysticism\"). Shneur Zalman's main work is the Tanya (or Sefer Shel Beinonim, \"Book of the Average Man\"). The Tanya is the central book of Chabad thought and is studied daily by followers of the Chabad movement. Shneur Zalman's other works include a collection of writings on Hasidic thought, and the Shulchan Aruch HaRav, a revised version of the code of Halakha, both of which are studied regularly by followers of Chabad. Shneur Zalman's successors went by last names such as \"Schneuri\" and \"Schneersohn\" (later \"Schneerson\"), signifying their descent from the movement's founder. He is commonly referred to as the \"Old Rebbe\" (Yiddish: \u05d0\u05b7\u05dc\u05d8\u05e2\u05e8 \u05e8\u05d1\u05d9, romanized: Alter Rebbe or Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d5\u05f4\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d6\u05e7\u05df, romanized: Admur Hazoken).\nRabbi Dovber Schneuri (1773\u20131827), son of Rabbi Shneur Zalman, led the Chabad movement in the town of Lyubavichi (Lubavitch). His leadership was initially disputed by Rabbi Aaron Halevi of Stroselye, however, Rabbi Dovber was generally recognized as his father's rightful successor, and the movement's leader. Rabbi Dovber published a number of his writings on Hasidic thought, greatly expanding his father's work. He also published some of his father's writings. Many of Rabbi Dovber's works have been subsequently republished by the Chabad movement. He is commonly referred to as the Mitteler Rebbe (Yiddish: \u05de\u05d9\u05d8\u05e2\u05dc\u05e2\u05e8 \u05e8\u05d1\u05d9 'Middle Rabbi', Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d5\u05f4\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d0\u05de\u05e6\u05e2\u05d9, romanized: Admur Ha'emtzoei).\nRabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn (1789\u20131866), a grandson of Rabbi Shneur Zalman and son-in-law of Rabbi Dovber. Following his attempt to persuade the Chabad movement to accept his brother-in-law or uncle as rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel assumed the title of rebbe of Chabad, also leading the movement from the town of Lyubavichi (Lubavitch). He published a number of his works on both Hasidic thought and Jewish law. Rabbi Menachem Mendel also published some of the works of his grandfather, Rabbi Shneur Zalman. He is commonly referred to as the Tzemach Tzedek after the title of his responsa.\nRabbi Shmuel Schneersohn (1834\u20131882), was the seventh and youngest son of Rabbi Menachem Mendel. He assumed the title of rebbe in town of Lyubavichi (Lubavitch), while several of his brothers assumed the title of rebbe in other towns, forming Chabad groups of their own which existed for several decades. Years after his death, his teachings were published by the Chabad movement. He is commonly referred to as the Maharash, an acronym for Moreinu HaRav Shmuel ('our teacher, Rabbi Shmuel').\nRabbi Shalom Dovber Schneersohn (1860\u20131920), Shmuel's second son, succeeded his father as rebbe. Rabbi Shalom Dovber waited some time before officially accepting the title of rebbe, as not to offend his elder brother, Zalman Aaron. He established a yeshiva called Tomchei Temimim. During World War I, he moved to Rostov-on-Don. Many of his writings were published after his death, and are studied regularly in Chabad yeshivas. He is commonly referred to as the Rashab, an acronym for Rabbi Shalom Ber.\nRabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn (1880\u20131950), the only son of Sholom Dovber, succeeded his father as rebbe of Chabad. Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak was exiled from Russia, following an attempt by the Bolshevik government to have him executed. He led the movement from Warsaw, Poland, until the start of World War II. After fleeing the Nazis, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak lived in Brooklyn, New York until his death. He established much of Chabad's current organizational structure, founding several of its central organizations as well as other Chabad institutions, both local and international. He published a number of his writings, as well as the works of his predecessors. He is commonly referred to as the Rayatz or the Frierdiker Rebbe ('Previous Rebbe').\nRabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson (1902\u20131994), son-in-law of Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak, and a great-grandson of the third Rebbe of Lubavitch, assumed the title of rebbe one year after his father-in-law's death. Rabbi Menachem Mendel greatly expanded Chabad's global network, establishing hundreds of new Chabad centers across the globe. He published many of his own works as well as the works of his predecessors. His teachings are studied regularly by followers of Chabad. He is commonly referred to as \"the Lubavitcher Rebbe\", or simply \"the Rebbe\". Even after his death, many continue to revere him as the leader of the Chabad movement.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The article was influential in the debate concerning the causes of British imperial expansion in the 19th-century which, since John A. Hobson's Imperialism: A Study (1902), had focused on economic motivation. Instead, Gallagher and Robinson claimed that the New Imperialism \u2013 \"the new spate of imperial expansion that gathered momentum from the 1880s\" \u2013 could be best characterised as a continuation of a longer-term policy begun in the 1850s in which informal empire, based on the principles of free trade, was favoured over formal imperial control unless circumstances made such rule impossible. As well as reigniting scholarly interest in theorizing New Imperialism, the article helped launch the Cambridge School of historiography.\nThe arguments proposed in the article were later developed in a full-length book, Africa and the Victorians (1961), in conjunction with Alice Denny. The book put forward a subtly different explanation for European expansion in Africa, built around geopolitics and a strategy of protecting British India from encroachment by other European powers. The strategic model and its relevance to East Africa was criticised for its limited documentary basis and sequential inconsistencies by John Darwin in 1997, a refutation that was further consolidated and contextualised by Jonas Gjers\u00f8 in 2015.Reviewing the debate from the end of the 20th century, historian  Martin Lynn argues that Gallagher and Robinson exaggerated its impact. He says that Britain achieved its goal of increasing its economic interests in many areas, \"but the broader goal of 'regenerating' societies and thereby creating regions tied as 'tributaries' to British economic interests was not attained.\" The reasons were:\n\nthe aim to reshape the world through free trade and its extension overseas owed more to the misplaced optimism of British policy-makers and their partial views of the world than to an understanding of the realities of the mid-19th century globe.... the volumes of trade and investment...the British were able to generate remained limited....Local economies and local regimes proved adept at restricting the reach of British trade and investment.  Local impediments to foreign inroads, the inhabitants' low purchasing power, the resilience of local manufacturing, and the capabilities of local entrepreneurs meant that these areas effectively resisted British economic penetration.\nThe idea that free-trade imperial states use informal methods to secure their expanding economic influence has attracted Marxist historiographers to use the theory to describe how the modern economic policies of the United States and the imperialist policies of Great Britain are essentially the same, in both motive and method.", "hasanswer": true}]}
{"id": "1433_95", "question": "What larger work was Yu Yu Hakusho published in?", "ctxs": [{"id": "1433_69373", "text": "Author Yoshihiro Togashi stated that he began working on YuYu Hakusho during a period of time around November 1990, though he forgot the exact time. He had recently completed the serialization of his romantic comedy Ten de Sh\u014dwaru Cupid in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump. Having felt somewhat intimidated by some of his more popular fellow authors during this manga's run, Togashi realized he would need to create a fighting manga to both gain popularity and write something he enjoyed. As a fan of the occult and horror films, he desired to write and illustrate a new manga based on his interests. Togashi had previously published an occult detective fiction manga titled Occult Tanteidan, of which he referenced positive reception from readers as a reason for continuing to create manga. When first producing YuYu Hakusho, he did not have a clear idea of what he wanted to call it. He used the tentative title \"How to be a Ghost\" while presenting rough drafts to his editors. Once given the go-ahead to begin publication, Togashi proposed \"YuYu-Ki\" (Poltergeist Chronicles) for the title, as there would be battles with demons and it would be a play on the title SaiYu-Ki. However, a series with a similar name (Chin-Yu-Ki) had already begun publication, so Togashi quickly created an alternative: \"YuYu Hakusho\" (Poltergeist Report). He commented that he could have used \"Den\" (Legend) or \"Monogatari\" (Story), but \"Hakusho\" (Report) was the first thing that came to his mind. He contiguously developed the names of the main characters by skimming through a dictionary and taking out kanji characters he found appealing. \"Yusuke Urameshi\" is a pun, \"Kazuma Kuwabara\" is a combination of two professional baseball players, and \"Hiei\" and \"Kurama\" are \"just names that popped into [Togashi's] head.\" When he introduced the latter two characters in volume three, the author had early plans to make Kurama a main character but was not certain about Hiei.The manga's shift from occult detective fiction to the martial arts genre after Yusuke's death and revival in the early chapters was planned by Togashi from the beginning. He took this idea from the series Kinnikuman, which began largely as a comedy before concentrating more on action. Togashi's intention was to establish the main characters and familiarize the reader with them before placing them in tense, physical conflicts. His editor at the time was nervous of him beginning the manga this way and recommended he transition to a battle-focused plot after about 30 chapters. YuYu Hakusho borrows many elements from Asian folklore, particularly Buddhist beliefs in the afterlife. Togashi came up with the concept of the Ningenkai (Human World), Reikai (Underworld), and Makai (Demon Plane) as being parallel planes of existence in the manga's universe. He thought of them as places that one could not easily travel between using modern technology, but rather as a spirit lacking a material body. However, the idea for the \"territory\" powers from the Sensui story arc was parodied from a separate, unnamed work by Yasutaka Tsutsui. For his drawing materials, Togashi used drafting ink and Kabura pens throughout the creation of the series. While his style of artwork began with screentone, he gradually developed into minimalism. As the series progressed, he would draw figures and faces very detailed or \"cartoony, sketchy and jumping with action\" whenever he desired such effects.During the years he worked on YuYu Hakusho, Togashi would calculate the personal time he had based on a formula of four hours per page without scripting and five hours of sleep per night. He wrote in his own d\u014djinshi Yoshirin de Pon! that he stopped the production on YuYu Hakusho out of selfishness. The author had originally wanted to end the manga in December 1993, at the climax of the Sensui arc. Although there was not a large demand from the editorial staff, Togashi was under a great deal of personal stress at certain points of the series' run, particularly during its final six months of publication. He claimed that, beginning with the Dark Tournament arc, inconsistent sleep resulting from overwork was causing him health problems. He noted himself as being very ill while working on the color pages for Yusuke's match with Chu. There were also many instances where he would create nearly entire manuscripts by himself, such as Yusuke's meeting with Raizen and the battle between Kurama and Karasu. The editors of the publication tried to make Togashi reconsider cancelling Yu Yu Hakusho, though he justified his decision by stating that it would simply be replaced by another popular series. Togashi was relieved at the conclusion of the manga. The author claimed to not have been involved in the production of the YuYu Hakusho anime adaptation due to his own work schedule. He stated that he was greatly impressed by Shigeru Chiba's voice depiction of Kuwabara, admitting that the voice actor understood the character better than Togashi himself.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Issued by Church President Wilford Woodruff in September 1890, the Manifesto was a response to mounting anti-polygamy pressure from the United States Congress, which by 1890 had disincorporated the church, escheated its assets to the U.S. federal government, and imprisoned many prominent polygamist Mormons. Upon its issuance, the LDS Church in conference accepted Woodruff's Manifesto as \"authoritative and binding.\"\nThe Manifesto was a dramatic turning point in the history of the LDS Church. It advised church members against entering into any marriage prohibited by the law of the land, and made it possible for Utah to become a U.S. state. Nevertheless, even after the Manifesto, the church quietly continued to perform a small number of plural marriages in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, thus necessitating a Second Manifesto during U.S. congressional hearings in 1904. Though neither Manifesto dissolved existing plural marriages, plural marriage in the LDS Church gradually died by attrition during the early-to-mid 20th century. The Manifesto was canonized in the LDS Church standard works as Official  Declaration 1 and is considered by mainstream Mormons to have been prompted by divine revelation (although not a revelation itself), in which Woodruff was shown that the church would be thrown into turmoil if they did not comply with it.

The article's first translator, William Ashton Ellis, gave it the title Judaism in Music. \"Judaism\" in modern English tends to refer to the Abrahamic religion of the Jews. \"Judenthum\" however in 19th-century Germany carried a much broader meaning, including the culture and social practices of the Jews. It also carried a pejorative sense associating Jews with money-making. Karl Marx in his 1843 essay On the Jewish Question uses the word in this sense, in which he associates Jews intrinsically with capitalist enterprise. Wagner also intended this latter dual meaning, given the context of the essay in which he uses \"Judenthum\" almost synonymously with \"commercialism\"; this usage is also reflected in his personal letters.Wagner's essay primarily attacks Jewish culture, artistic taste, and alleged economic power and commercialism, rather than the Jewish race or religion. In the essay Wagner speaks of the need to emancipate both Jews and non-Jews from \"Judenthum\". For this reason, alternative translations of the title have been given, including Jewishness in Music and Jewry in Music.The essay was written during his exile in Z\u00fcrich after participating in the May Uprising in Dresden, part of the Revolutions of 1848. It follows Art and Revolution and The Artwork of the Future in a series of polemical essays intended to provoke controversy and discussion over the purpose and future direction of European art. Wagner had a radical mindset at the time, and was formulating what would become his magnum opus, the 16-hour long music drama Der Ring des Nibelungen, with which he intended to revitalize German art and society, which he perceived to be in decline.\nIn these previous essays, Wagner criticized the perceived shallowness of the then-popular French grand opera, such as that of the celebrated Jewish composer Giacomo Meyerbeer. Wagner was emboldened to write again on the subject, this time from a fully antisemitic perspective, after learning of the great success of Meyerbeer's 1849 opera Le proph\u00e8te, and reading a series of essays written by his close associate Theodor Uhlig, criticizing Le proph\u00e8t as exemplifying inferior \"Hebrew artistic taste\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

The first of these was A Tale of a Tub by Jonathan Swift, whom Carlyle intensely admired in his college years, even going by the nicknames \"Jonathan\" and \"The Dean\". In that work, the three main traditions of Western Christianity are represented by a father bestowing his three children with clothes they may never alter, but proceed to do so according to fashion. Carlyle's second influence, according to MacMechan, was his own work in translating Goethe, particularly Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, The Sorrows of Young Werther, and Faust, all of which Carlyle quotes and explicitly refers to, especially when Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh names his own crisis \"The Sorrows of Young Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh\". The third major influence was Tristram Shandy from which Carlyle quotes many phrases, and to which he referred in earlier letters.\nCarlyle worked on an earlier novel, Wotton Reinfred, which MacMechan refers to as \"[t]he first draft of Sartor.\" Carlyle finished seven chapters of the semi-autobiographical novel depicting a young man of deeply religious upbringing being scorned in love, and thereafter wandering. He eventually finds at least philosophical consolation in a mysterious stranger named Maurice Herbert, who invites Wotton into his home and frequently discusses speculative philosophy with him. At this point, the novel abruptly shifts to highly philosophical dialogue revolving mostly around Kant. Though the unfinished novel deeply impressed Carlyle's wife Jane, (n\u00e9e Welsh) Carlyle never published it and its existence was forgotten until long after Carlyle's death. MacMechan suggests that the novel provoked Carlyle's frustration and scorn due to the \"zeal for truth and his hatred for fiction\" he speaks of in his letters of the time. Numerous parts of Wotton appear in the biographical section of Sartor Resartus, where Carlyle humorously turns them into Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's autobiographical sketches, which the editor constantly complains are overly fragmented or derivative of Goethe. Though widely and erroneously reported as having been burned by Carlyle, the unfinished novel is still extant in draft form; several passages were moved verbatim to Sartor Resartus, but with their context radically changed.Carlyle had difficulty finding a publisher for the novel, and he began composing it as an article in October 1831 at Craigenputtock. Fraser's Magazine serialised it in 1833\u20131834. The text would first appear in volume form in Boston in 1836, its publication arranged by Ralph Waldo Emerson, who much admired the book and Carlyle. Emerson's savvy dealing with the overseas publishers would ensure Carlyle received high compensation, which the novel did not attain in Britain.

In the argument, first published as a journal article in Mind in 1908, McTaggart argues that time is unreal because our descriptions of time are either contradictory, circular, or insufficient. A slightly different version of the argument appeared in 1927 as one of the chapters in the second volume of McTaggart's greatest work, The Nature of Existence.The argument for the unreality of time is popularly treated as a stand-alone argument that does not depend on any significant metaphysical principles (e.g. as argued by C. D. Broad 1933 and L. O. Mink 1960). R. D. Ingthorsson disputes this, and argues that the argument can only be understood as an attempt to draw out certain consequences of the metaphysical system that McTaggart presents in the first volume of The Nature of Existence (Ingthorsson 1998 & 2016).\nIt is helpful to consider the argument as consisting of three parts. In the first part, McTaggart offers a phenomenological analysis of the appearance of time, in terms of the now famous A- and B-series (see below for detail). In the second part, he argues that a conception of time as only forming a B-series but not an A-series is an inadequate conception of time because the B-series does not contain any notion of change. The A-series, on the other hand, appears to contain change and is thus more likely to be an adequate conception of time. In the third and final part, he argues that the conception of time forming an A-series is contradictory and thus nothing can be like an A-series. Since the A- and the B- series exhaust possible conceptions of how reality can be temporal, and neither is adequate, the conclusion McTaggart reaches is that reality is not temporal at all.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Her husband is George Tesman, a young, aspiring, and reliable academic who continued his research during their honeymoon. It becomes clear in the course of the play that she never loved him, but married him because she thinks her years of youthful abandon are over. \nThe reappearance of George's academic rival, Eilert L\u00f8vborg, throws their lives into disarray. Eilert, a writer, is also a recovered alcoholic who has wasted his talent until now. Thanks to a relationship with Hedda's old schoolmate, Thea Elvsted (who has left her husband for him), Eilert shows signs of rehabilitation and has just published a bestseller in the same field as George's. When Hedda and Eilert talk privately together, it becomes apparent that they are former lovers.\nThe critical success of his recently published work makes Eilert a threat to George, as Eilert is now a competitor for the university professorship George had been anticipating. George and Hedda are financially overstretched, and George tells Hedda that he will not be able to finance the regular entertaining or luxurious housekeeping that she had been expecting. Upon meeting Eilert, however, the couple discovers that he has no intention of competing for the professorship, but rather has spent the last few years working on what he considers to be his masterpiece, the \"sequel\" to his recently published work.\nApparently jealous of Thea's influence over Eilert, Hedda hopes to come between them. Despite his drinking problem, she encourages Eilert to accompany George and his associate, Judge Brack, to a party. George returns home from the party and reveals that he found the complete manuscript (the only copy) of Eilert's great work, which the latter lost while drunk. George is then called away to his aunt's house, leaving the manuscript in Hedda's possession. When Eilert next sees Hedda and Thea, he tells them that he has deliberately destroyed the manuscript. Thea is horrified, and it is revealed that it was the joint work of Eilert and herself. Hedda says nothing to contradict Eilert or to reassure Thea. After Thea has left, Hedda encourages Eilert to commit suicide, giving him a pistol that had belonged to her father. She then burns the manuscript and tells George she has destroyed it to secure their future.\nWhen the news comes that Eilert did indeed kill himself, George and Thea are determined to try to reconstruct his book from Eilert's notes, which Thea has kept. Hedda is shocked to discover from Judge Brack that Eilert's death, in a brothel, was messy and probably accidental; this \"ridiculous and vile\" death contrasts with the \"beautiful and free\" one that Hedda had imagined for him. Worse, Brack knows the origins of the pistol. He tells Hedda that if he reveals what he knows, a scandal will likely arise around her. Hedda realizes that this places Brack in a position of power over her. Leaving the others, she goes into her smaller room and shoots herself in the head. The others in the room assume that Hedda is simply firing shots, and they follow the sound to investigate. The play ends with George, Brack, and Thea discovering her body.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Regarding the film, Rogen and Goldberg told interviewers that \"We always wanted to do a movie where people played themselves and something extraordinary happened; the initial version of the film was Seth Rogen and Busta Rhymes were filming a music video and a film respectively, on the Sony lot, and Antmen attacked from the center of the earth.\"In an interview with The Guardian, Goldberg commented on the influences contributing to the film, \"If you drilled down to the core of what I do, it's just ripping off little bits of Charlie Kaufman. Seth and I always loved The Larry Sanders Show too. And the popularity of reality television now also feeds into that idea of whether what we're watching is actually real. We thought working with our friends in that situation would be awesome because they're all comedians willing to take stabs at themselves.\" The actors play fictionalized and exaggerated versions of themselves in the film, with only James Franco having no objections to doing what the script wanted him to do.While the film is set in Los Angeles, principal photography took place in New Orleans due to financial incentives from that city. Filming rolled from February to early July 2012. The film had a production budget of $42 million, with $32 million spent in Louisiana. Modus FX created over 240 visual effects for the film, such as natural disasters, set extensions for the house, computer-generated demons and the Rapture beams. After filming wrapped, Rogen and Goldberg were displeased with their ending; they considered putting Morgan Freeman in Heaven, but he declined. Since \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" already played in an earlier scene and Rogen and Goldberg wanted to close on an over-the-top note, they decided to feature the Backstreet Boys in the scene instead.During filming, Emma Watson left the set due to scenes being improvised that she felt uncomfortable with, such as the progression of the graphic nature of the scenes involving Danny McBride as a cannibal and Channing Tatum as his sex slave. Rogen confirmed this, stating it was \"an overall shitty situation, and it must've been hard for her to say something\", elaborating \"I'm very sorry and disappointed it happened, and I wish I had done more to prevent it.\"Originally, the film's working title was The Apocalypse, which was later changed to The End of the World. The name was then changed to This Is the End on December 20, 2012, upon the release of its first trailer and poster. This was done at the request of Rogen's Paul costar Simon Pegg, who wrote to Rogen in concern that The End of the World was similar to his own comedy film The World's End, which was also released in the summer of 2013 and centered around an apocalypse with an ensemble cast. As The World's End was also the name of a key location in that film, Pegg felt worried that he couldn't change the name of his film.In a May 2023 interview with The Daily Beast, Jay Baruchel revealed that the onscreen depiction of his difficulties with Jonah Hill in the film weren't entirely fictional, saying \u201cNot telling tales out of school, I don\u2019t think, Jonah and I don\u2019t get along super well, or at least didn\u2019t back then.\u201d", "hasanswer": false}]}

Bob remembers that the town served as the filming location of a shark-themed \u201880s B movie, The Deepening. The family discovers that the original prop shark from the movie is up for sale and convinces Fischoeder to buy it. However, Teddy ominously objects.\nAt the unveiling of the shark, the Belchers find out Fischoeder has filled it with diesel. The shark, which is now able to move, nearly causes an accident by ripping off a woman\u2019s prosthetic arm. Early the next morning, the Belcher kids sneak off to Wonder Wharf to steal the shark\u2019s fin for \"mechanical shark fin soup.\" Gene mounts the shark with a knife to cut off its fin, but he accidentally knocks the shark off its perch: the kids leave, and Louise tells her siblings to act like they were \"never there.\"\nThat same morning, Bob notices people panicking outside and goes to investigate. He arrives at Wonder Wharf to find the mechanical shark flopping around on the ground. Fischoeder reveals there is no way to stop the shark until it runs out of gas; furthermore, he is reluctant to stop it, as it is now drawing larger crowds than ever. Bob worries the shark will leave the wharf and pleads with Fischoeder, but it is already too late: the shark smashes through the gates of Wonder Wharf and runs amok in traffic.\nBob, as \u201cBlock Captain,\u201d rallies the local business owners to figure out what to do about the shark. Tina, who empathized with the shark after watching The Deepening, tries to dissuade the townspeople from stopping its progress. After she impulsively confesses that she and the kids knocked over the shark, the townspeople begin to turn on the Belchers. But Teddy encourages the townspeople to work together, and they begin brainstorming how to stop the shark, which is now heading towards Bob's restaurant.\nEach of the townspeople's ideas goes horribly wrong and only serves to make the shark more dangerous: a spike strip becomes attached to the shark, an oil slick intended to \u201cslow its momentum\u201d ends up making it faster, and after it hits a telephone pole, it becomes electrified. Finally, the shark falls into a hole in the ground that the townspeople dug to catch it. This seems to work until subterranean noises indicate the shark has eaten its way into Bob\u2019s basement.\nBob, Teddy, and Mort enter the restaurant to try and stop the shark. Teddy reveals the reason for his hatred of the shark: he acted as a lifeguard in The Deepening. While talking to a girl on set, the prop operator startled him with the shark, causing him to spill his drink on the girl and embarrass himself. Bob asks Teddy why he resents the shark instead of the operator; Teddy stops to consider this logic briefly before deciding he still hates the shark.\nThe shark emerges from the ground, knocking Mort into the basement. Teddy falls into the shark\u2019s mouth, though his \"boydle\" prevents him from being crushed by its teeth. Tina gets the idea to fill the shark with ice cream from their soft serve machine, which has fallen inside the shark\u2019s body. Bob is able to plug in the machine, and the shark, now filled with ice cream, finally ends its rampage. On a news report, Hugo, the health inspector and \"Quadrant Captain,\" takes credit for stopping the shark.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Although he had steadily produced work for over a decade (without commercial success), Sarrasine was among his earliest publications to appear without a pseudonym.\nDuring the period in which the novella was written, Balzac was involved in many salons, including that of Madame Recamier. Around the time in which Sarrasine was published, Balzac experienced great success with another work, La Peau de Chagrin (1831). As his career began to take off and his publications began to accumulate, Balzac developed increasingly lavish living habits and frequently made impulsive purchases (such as new furniture for his apartment and a hooded white cashmere gown designed to be worn by a monk, which he wore at night while writing), likely to distance himself from his family's prior debt, which had resulted from his business as an editor and printer's liquidation.\nIn 1841, an ill Balzac reached an agreement with Furne & Co., Dubochet, Hetzel and Paulin to publish La Com\u00e9die humaine.

He came up with the final name Hunter \u00d7 Hunter while watching the television variety show Downtown, in which the hosts often repeat what they say to make the audience laugh. The \"\u00d7\" in the title is silent. As with his previous series, YuYu Hakusho, Togashi used drafting ink and Kabura pens for his illustrations but began using an eMac to color them. Togashi uses few or no assistants in the manga's production; however, fellow manga artist and future wife Naoko Takeuchi assisted Togashi in adding screentone to single-color pages for the first volume. With the birth of their first son early in its publication, Togashi felt that this personal aspect of his life would be a great influence on his work, particularly the manga's theme of a young boy searching for his father.There have been several instances in which Togashi has apologized to readers in Shueisha's Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump for low-quality artwork and promised to redraw portions of the chapters for their tank\u014dbon (collected volume) releases. In addition, the publication history of the Hunter \u00d7 Hunter manga has been plagued with hiatuses since 2006, in which serialized chapters would be separated by extended periods of time. After returning from a two-year-long hiatus in June 2014, and joining the English-language Weekly Shonen Jump lineup, the manga went on another just two months later. The series returned from this hiatus on April 18, 2016, however, just over two months later, Hunter \u00d7 Hunter began another hiatus on June 4, 2016. It came back on June 26, 2017, and just over two months later, on August 31, the series went on hiatus again, planning to return by the end of that year. The series came back on January 29, 2018, before going on hiatus again on April 9 of the same year. After a five-month hiatus, the manga resumed publication from September 22 to November 26, 2018, before entering another hiatus for four years, its longest one to date.In May 2022, Togashi created a Twitter account where he teased that the series would resume publication. In July 2022, Togashi revealed that he was unable to sit in a chair for two years due to his back and hip problems, but was able to resume drawing by doing so while laying down; in August of the same year, Togashi posted on Twitter that he decided to increase his staff, adding that chapter 399's background effects were done according to his request and that chapter 400 would move forward after Togashi hands in his specifications for it. The series resumed publication on October 24, 2022, after a three-year-and-eleven-month hiatus. On December 26, 2022, it was announced that the manga would enter on hiatus. The Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump editorial department published a letter which said that they had consulted with Togashi and decided that the manga should not follow a weekly serialized format going forward, and that once they know concrete details of its return and how it will be serialized, they will reveal the details in the magazine. On March 9, 2023, Togashi tweeted that chapter 401 had been completed, but the form of publication has not been decided at the time. On October 1 of the same year, Togashi made his first tweet in nearly seven months, which contained the phrase \"Start over\" in English, as well as an image depicting the bottom right corner of a page with a ruler below.In November 2023, on TV Asahi's variety show Iwakura and Yoshizumi Show, Togashi announced that he had planned four possible scenarios for the series' finale through a handwritten letter which was read aloud during the program. Only the fourth abandoned ending (\"ending D\") was revealed, stating that it could be considered the ending in case he dies before finishing the manga. This ending takes place after a time skip, years into the future, featuring Gon's granddaughter, Gin.

In Greenwood's original conception, the fantastic legends of Earth derive from a fantasy world that can no longer be accessed. Greenwood discovered the Dungeons & Dragons game in 1975, and became a serious role-playing enthusiast with the first Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) game releases in 1978. Greenwood brought his fantasy world into the new medium of role-playing games when a university student named September invited him to play AD&D with her.:\u200a72\u200a The setting became the home of Greenwood's personal campaign. Greenwood began a Realms campaign in the city of Waterdeep before creating a group known as the Knights of Myth Drannor in the Shadowdale region. Greenwood felt that his players' thirst for detail made the Realms what it is: \"They want it to seem real, and work on 'honest jobs' and personal activities, until the whole thing grows into far more than a casual campaign. Roleplaying always governs over rules, and the adventures seem to develop themselves.\" Greenwood has stated that his own version of the Forgotten Realms, as run in his personal campaign, is much darker than published versions.Starting in 1979, Greenwood published a series of articles that detailed the setting in The Dragon (now Dragon) magazine, the first of which was about a monster known as the curst.:\u200a72\u200a Greenwood wrote voluminous entries to Dragon, and used the Realms as a setting for his descriptions of magic items, monsters, and spells. When Gary Gygax \"lost control of TSR in 1985, the company saw an opportunity to move beyond Greyhawk and introduce a new default setting\".:\u200a87\u200a In 1986, TSR began looking for a new campaign setting for AD&D,:\u200a72\u200a and assigned Jeff Grubb to find out more about the setting used by Greenwood as portrayed in his articles in Dragon.Greenwood states that Grubb asked him \"Do you just make this stuff up as you go, or do you really have a huge campaign world?\", and Greenwood answered \"yes\" to both questions. TSR felt that the Forgotten Realms would be a more open-ended setting than its epic fantasy counterpart Dragonlance, and chose the Realms as a ready-made campaign setting upon deciding to publish AD&D 2nd edition. Greenwood agreed to work on the project and began working to get Forgotten Realms officially published. He sent TSR a few dozen cardboard boxes stuffed with pencil notes and maps, and sold all rights to the setting for a token fee. He noted that TSR altered his original conception of the Realms being a place that could be accessed from Earth, as \"[c]oncerns over possible lawsuits (kids getting hurt while trying to 'find a gate') led TSR to de-emphasize this meaning\".Jon Peterson, author of Dungeons and Dragons Art and Arcana: A Visual History, said that Greenwood \"was that rare obsessive DM who just seemed to have more ideas and energy to pour into his world than even the folks at TSR did.

The film was frequently referred to in the media as the \"gay cowboy movie\", but a number of reviewers noted that both Jack and Ennis were bisexual. Sex researcher Fritz Klein said that the film was \"a nice film with two main characters who were bisexual\" and suggested that the character of Jack is more \"toward the gay side\" of the spectrum and Ennis is \"a bit more toward the straight side\".Gyllenhaal said in 2006 that Ennis and Jack were straight men who \"develop this love, this bond,\" saying in a Details interview: \"I approached the story believing that these are actually two straight guys who fall in love.\" However, in 2015, he told The Hollywood Reporter that this was a \"gay love story\", and that his character was the more \"overtly gay\" of the two. Ledger told Time magazine in 2005: \"I don't think Ennis could be labeled as gay. Without Jack Twist, I don't know that he ever would have come out. I think the whole point was that it was two souls that fell in love with each other.\"Others said they felt the characters' sexuality was meant to be ambiguous. Clarence Patton and Christopher Murray of New York's Gay City News wrote that Ennis and Jack's experiences were metaphors for \"many men who do not identify as gay or even queer, but who nevertheless have sex with other men\". Entertainment Weekly wrote that \"everyone called it 'The Gay Cowboy Movie' until they saw it. In the end, Ang Lee's 2005 love story wasn't gay or straight, just human.\" Tom Ciorciari of EFilmCritic.com wrote: \"We later see Jack eagerly engage Lureen sexually, with no explanation as to whether he is bisexual, so in need of physical intimacy that anyone, regardless of gender, will do, or merely very adept at faking it.\"LGBT non-fiction author Eric Marcus dismissed \"talk of Ennis and Jack being anything but gay as box office-influenced political correctness intended to steer straight audiences to the film\". Roger Ebert believed that both characters were gay, but doubted it themselves: \"Jack is able to accept a little more willingly that he is inescapably gay.\" Producer James Schamus said, \"I suppose movies can be Rorschach tests for all of us, but damn if these characters aren't gay to me.\" Brokeback Mountain author Annie Proulx said, \"how different readers take the story is a reflection of their own personal values, attitudes, hang-ups.\"When Ledger and Gyllenhaal were asked if they feared being cast in controversial roles, Ledger stated that he was not afraid of the role, but rather he was concerned that he would not be mature enough as an actor to do the story justice. Gyllenhaal has stated that he is proud of the film and his role, regardless of what the reactions would be. He thinks rumors of him being bisexual are flattering, stating: \"I'm open to whatever people want to call me. I've never really been attracted to men sexually, but I don't think I would be afraid of it if it happened.\" Lee described himself as shy upon shooting the first sex scene and found it initially, technically difficult but praised Ledger and Gyllenhaal for their professionalism. Ledger's performance was described by Luke Davies as a difficult and empowering portrayal given the environment of the film: \"In Brokeback Mountain the vulnerability, the potential for danger, is so great \u2013 a world so masculine it might destroy you for any aberration \u2013 that [Ledger's] real brilliance was to bring to the screen a character, Ennis Del Mar, so fundamentally shut down that he is like a bible of unrequited desires, stifled yearnings, lost potential.\"Author Jim Kitses quoted Diana Ossana's acknowledgement of how the film \"subverts the myth of the American West and its iconic heroes.\" He commented: \"What drives the emotional attack of the film is the inadequacy of its characters to articulate and understand, let alone control, the experience that strikes them like a storm.

Lake Harku is the second-largest lake within the borders of Tallinn and its area is 1.6 km2 (0.6 sq mi). The only significant river in Tallinn nowadays is the Pirita river, in the eponymous Pirita city district. Historically, a smaller river, called H\u00e4rjapea, flowed from Lake \u00dclemiste through the town into the sea, but the river was diverted into underground sewerage system in the 1930s and has since completely disappeared from the cityscape. References to it still remain in the street names J\u00f5e (from j\u00f5gi, river) and Kivisilla (from kivi sild, stone bridge).\nThe length of the seaside coast is 46 km (29 mi), comprising three larger (Kopli, Paljassaare, and Kakum\u00e4e) peninsulas. The city has a number of public beaches, including those at Pirita, Stroomi, Kakum\u00e4e, Harku, and Pikakari.The highest point in Tallinn, at 64 m (about 200 ft) above sea level, is situated in Hiiu, N\u00f5mme District, in the south-west of the city. A large limestone cliff runs through the city. It can be seen at Toompea, Lasnam\u00e4e, and Astangu. However, the hill at Toompea is not geologically part of the larger limestone cliff.\nThe rocks and sediments underneath Tallinn are of different composition and age. Youngest are the Quaternary deposits. The materials of these deposits are till, varved clay, sand, gravel, and pebbles that are of glacial, marine and lacustrine origin. Some of the Quaternary deposits are valuable as they constitute aquifers, or as in the case of gravels and sands, are used as construction materials. The Quaternary deposits are the fill of valleys that are now buried. The buried valleys of Tallinn are carved into older rock likely by ancient rivers to be later modified by glaciers. While the valley fill is made up of Quaternary sediments the valleys themselves originated from erosion that took place before the Quaternary. The substrate into which the buried valleys were carved is made up of hard sedimentary rock of Ediacaran, Cambrian and Ordovician age. Only the upper layer of Ordovician rocks protrudes from the cover of younger deposits, cropping out in the Baltic Klint at the coast and at a few places inland. The Ordovician rocks are made up from top to bottom of a thick layer of limestone and marlstone, then a first layer of argillite followed by first layer of sandstone and siltstone and then another layer of argillite also followed by sandstone and siltstone. In other places of the city, hard sedimentary rock is only to be found beneath Quaternary sediments at depths reaching as much as 120 m below sea level. Underlying the sedimentary rock are the rocks of the Fennoscandian Craton including gneisses and other metamorphic rocks with volcanic rock protoliths and rapakivi granites.

In general, though, it is best to stay away from themes that are too confining. If you achieve your goal of syndication, you want your strip to last a long time. You don't want to run out of ideas after a few weeks or months. In humor strips, it is better to build around a character than around a job. For example, it is possible to do some very funny comic strip gags about a taxi driver. But a strip that is limited to taxi driver gags is bound to wear thin pretty fast. I'd rather see a strip about a warmly funny man who just happens to earn his living as a cabbie and whose job is only a minor facet of his potential for inspiring gags. Narrative strips can be and often are based on the central character's job. For example, the basis of a private eye strip is the work he does. But even here the strip will only be as successful as the characterization in it. The big question is: what kind of a man is this particular private eye?", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "1433_149", "question": "What larger work was \"The Writing of the God\" published in?", "ctxs": [{"id": "69_3573", "text": "Kierkegaard published some of his works using pseudonyms and for others he signed his own name as author. Whether being published under pseudonym or not, Kierkegaard's central writing on religion was Fear and Trembling, and Either/Or is considered to be his magnum opus. Pseudonyms were used often in the early 19th century as a means of representing viewpoints other than the author's own. Kierkegaard employed the same technique as a way to provide examples of indirect communication. In writing under various pseudonyms to express sometimes contradictory positions, Kierkegaard is sometimes criticized for playing with various viewpoints without ever committing to one in particular. He has been described by those opposing his writings as indeterminate in his standpoint as a writer, though he himself has testified to all his work deriving from a service to Christianity. After On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates, his 1841 master's thesis under Frederik Christian Sibbern, he wrote his first book under the pseudonym \"Johannes Climacus\" (after John Climacus) between 1841 and 1842. De omnibus dubitandum est (Latin: \"Everything must be doubted\") was not published until after his death.\nKierkegaard's magnum opus Either/Or was published 20 February 1843; it was mostly written during Kierkegaard's stay in Berlin, where he took notes on Schelling's Philosophy of Revelation. Either/Or includes essays of literary and music criticism and a set of romantic-like aphorisms, as part of his larger theme of examining the reflective and philosophical structure of faith. Edited by \"Victor Eremita\", the book contained the papers of an unknown \"A\" and \"B\" which the pseudonymous author claimed to have discovered in a secret drawer of his secretary. Eremita had a hard time putting the papers of \"A\" in order because they were not straightforward. \"B\"'s papers were arranged in an orderly fashion. Both of these characters are trying to become religious individuals. Each approached the idea of first love from an aesthetic and an ethical point of view. The book is basically an argument about faith and marriage with a short discourse at the end telling them they should stop arguing. Eremita thinks \"B\", a judge, makes the most sense. Kierkegaard stressed the \"how\" of Christianity as well as the \"how\" of book reading in his works rather than the \"what\".Three months after the publication of Either/Or, 16 May 1843, he published Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 and continued to publish discourses along with his pseudonymous books. These discourses were published under Kierkegaard's own name and are available as Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses today. David F. Swenson first translated the works in the 1940s and titled them the Edifying Discourses; however, in 1990, Howard V. and Edna H. Hong translated the works again but called them the Upbuilding Discourses. The word \"upbuilding\" was more in line with Kierkegaard's thought after 1846, when he wrote Christian deliberations about Works of Love. An upbuilding discourse or edifying discourse isn't the same as a sermon because a sermon is preached to a congregation while a discourse can be carried on between several people or even with oneself. The discourse or conversation should be \"upbuilding\", which means one would build up the other person, or oneself, rather than tear down to build up. Kierkegaard said: \"Although this little book (which is called 'discourses', not sermons, because its author does not have authority to preach, 'upbuilding discourses', not discourses for upbuilding, because the speaker by no means claims to be a teacher) wishes to be only what it is, a superfluity, and desires only to remain in hiding\".On 16 October 1843, Kierkegaard published three more books about love and faith and several more discourses. Fear and Trembling was published under the pseudonym Johannes de Silentio. Repetition is about a Young Man (S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard) who has anxiety and depression because he feels he has to sacrifice his love for a girl (Regine Olsen) to God. He tries to see if the new science of psychology can help him understand himself. Constantin Constantius, who is the pseudonymous author of that book, is the psychologist. At the same time, he published Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 under his own name, which dealt specifically with how love can be used to hide things from yourself or others. These three books, all published on the same day, are an example of Kierkegaard's method of indirect communication.\nKierkegaard questioned whether an individual can know if something is a good gift from God or not and concludes by saying, \"it does not depend, then, merely upon what one sees, but what one sees depends upon how one sees; all observation is not just a receiving, a discovering, but also a bringing forth, and insofar as it is that, how the observer himself is constituted is indeed decisive.\" God's love is imparted indirectly just as our own sometimes is.During 1844, he published two, three, and four more upbuilding discourses just as he did in 1843, but here he discussed how an individual might come to know God. Theologians, philosophers and historians were all engaged in debating about the existence of God. This is direct communication and Kierkegaard thinks this might be useful for theologians, philosophers, and historians (associations) but not at all useful for the \"single individual\" who is interested in becoming a Christian. Kierkegaard always wrote for \"that single individual whom I with joy and gratitude call my reader\"; the single individual must put what is understood to use or it will be lost. Reflection can take an individual only so far before the imagination begins to change the whole content of what was being thought about. Love is won by being exercised just as much as faith and patience are.\nHe also wrote several more pseudonymous books in 1844: Philosophical Fragments, Prefaces and The Concept of Anxiety and finished the year up with Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1844. He used indirect communication in the first book and direct communication in the rest of them. He doesn't believe the question about God's existence should be an opinion held by one group and differently by another no matter how many demonstrations are made. He says it's up to the single individual to make the fruit of the Holy Spirit real because love and joy are always just possibilities. Christendom wanted to define God's attributes once and for all but Kierkegaard was against this. His love for Regine was a disaster but it helped him because of his point of view.Kierkegaard believed \"each generation has its own task and need not trouble itself unduly by being everything to previous and succeeding generations\". In an earlier book he had said, \"to a certain degree every generation and every individual begins his life from the beginning\", and in another, \"no generation has learned to love from another, no generation is able to begin at any other point than the beginning\", \"no generation learns the essentially human from a previous one.\" And, finally, in 1850 he wrote, \"those true Christians who in every generation live a life contemporaneous with that of Christ have nothing whatsoever to do with Christians of the preceding generation, but all the more with their contemporary, Christ. His life here on earth attends every generation, and every generation severally, as Sacred History...\" But in 1848, \"The whole generation and every individual in the generation is a participant in one's having faith.\"\nHe was against the Hegelian idea of mediation because it introduces a \"third term\" that comes between the single individual and the object of desire. Kierkegaard wrote in 1844, 'If a person can be assured of the grace of God without needing temporal evidence as a middleman or as the dispensation advantageous to him as interpreter, then it is indeed obvious to him that the grace of God is the most glorious of all.\" He was against mediation and settled instead on the choice to be content with the grace of God or not. It's the choice between the possibility of the \"temporal and the eternal\", \"mistrust and belief, and deception and truth\", \"subjective and objective\". These are the \"magnitudes\" of choice. He always stressed deliberation and choice in his writings and wrote against comparison. This is how Kant put it in 1786 and Kierkegaard put it in 1847: Thinking for one's self is to seek the chief touchstone of truth in one's self (id est, in one's own reason); and the maxim, to think for one's self at all times is Enlightening. Thereto belongs not just so much, as those may imagine who take knowledge, to be enlightening; as it is rather a negative principle in the use of one's cognoscitive faculty, and he, who is very rich in knowledge, is often the least enlightened in the use of it. To exercise one's own reason, means nothing more, than, relatively to every thing which one is to suppose, to question one's self.\nWorldly worry always seeks to lead a human being into the small-minded unrest of comparisons, away from the lofty calmness of simple thoughts. To be clothed, then, means to be a human being\u2014and therefore to be well clothed. Worldly worry is preoccupied with clothes and dissimilarity of clothes.  Should not the invitation to learn from the lilies be welcome to everyone just as the reminder is useful to him! Alas, those great, uplifting, simple thoughts, those first thoughts, are more and more forgotten, perhaps entirely forgotten in the weekday and worldly life of comparisons. The one human being compares himself with others, the one generation compares itself with the other, and thus the heaped up pile of comparisons overwhelms a person. As the ingenuity and busyness increase, there come to be more and more in each generation who slavishly work a whole lifetime far down in the low underground regions of comparisons. Indeed, just as miners never see the light of day, so these unhappy people never come to see the light: those uplifting, simple thoughts, those first thoughts about how glorious it is to be a human being. And up there in the higher regions of comparison, smiling vanity plays its false game and deceives the happy ones so that they receive no impression from those lofty, simple thoughts, those first thoughts.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The scene provides the backdrop for a psychological exploration of the themes of sin, repentance, and morality. Much of the story focuses on the acrimonious reaction of the congregation to the seemingly benign veil. Hawthorne uses their reaction as a critique of the Puritan image of original sin, using the veil as a representation not of \"secret sin\" but the inherent sinful nature of all people.The story is both allegorical and didactic. The main themes are hidden sin and underlying guilt, with Hooper's method of preaching being to wear his sin on his face in a literal way. The townspeople grow uncomfortable with him because they start to become aware of their own sin. Hawthorne keeps the motive of the veil unknown to the reader. But the interpretation of the story generally rests on some moral assessment or explanation of the minister's symbolic self-veiling. Literary critic Edgar Allan Poe proposed that the issue of the minister's self-veiling was a mystery conceived to be solved or inferred by the reader. While Poe proposed this, Hawthorne never lets the reader know the reasoning behind the veil. While the veil is the main symbol in the story, it is also ironic. Hooper, in his stubborn use of the veil parable of one sin, is unconsciously guilty of a greater sin: that of egotistically warping the total meaning of life. In addition to standing for a man's concealment or hypocrisy and for Hooper's own sin of pride with its isolating effects, it stands also for the hidden quality of second sin. Hawthorne's use of ambiguity can be portrayed in many different ways: the manipulation of setting, manipulation of lighting and effects, and the use of an unreliable narrator to weave a shocking story that could or could not be likely. The narrator's credibility tends to be questionable because it is not a direct source. In using a third-person narrator, the minister's motives are never solidified, which keeps up the suspense.Hidden nature of guilt: Hooper arouses in a sermon the notion of secret sin and the sad mysteries in which we hide from our nearest and dearest. Hooper acknowledges the problem of sin, the guilt that is admitted openly, and the guilt of sin that is repressed or hidden from the world. When the Reverend Hooper makes the people aware of the darkness within his being, he  dissolves the barrier between his repugnant, repressed self and his conscious self. This barrier is characterized by the veil, which is transferred into the expression of hidden guilt. Hooper, in the story, announces to the congregation at his bedside that everyone wears a black veil; he implies that everyone has some form of secret guilt.\nCommunion of sinners: Hooper leads the townspeople in realizing that everyone shares sin no matter how much they try to avoid facing it. All people sin and it is up to them whether they face their sin or ignore it.  Hooper tries to teach a lesson.  In content, the lesson may be very much like the sermon on \"secret sin\" Hooper was scheduled to teach, but the townspeople are uncomfortable with the medium. The veil is something they have to see every day, rather than a sermon just once or twice a week.Morality: Hawthorne's use of Hooper's veil teaches that whether we face it or not, we all sin and must accept what we have done, because judgment will come for everyone. Hooper decides to represent hidden sin and guilt in a literal way to reach out to his followers.John H. Timmerman notes that because of Hawthorne's writing style Hooper's insistent use of the black veil, Hooper stands as one of his arch-villains. This is from Hooper's act of separating himself from the rest of humanity and denying his love for Elizabeth in favor of the veil.", "hasanswer": false}]}

A Critique of Reinhart and Rogoff\", later published in the Cambridge Journal of Economics. They contend that the statistical analyses performed on the data in the original RR Excel spreadsheet (which were used to support the conclusions of the paper) were flawed: \"While using RR's working spreadsheet, we identified coding errors, selective exclusion of available data, and unconventional weighting of summary statistics.\" Using RR's working spreadsheet, but correcting for the claimed errors, HAP found:When properly calculated, the average real GDP growth rate for countries carrying a public-debt-to-GDP ratio of over 90 percent is actually 2.2 percent, not \u22120.1 percent as published in Reinhart and Rogoff. That is, contrary to RR, average GDP growth at public debt/GDP ratios over 90 percent is not dramatically different than when debt/GDP ratios are lower.\nHAP also argued that the sample was biased, claiming that RR selectively omitted data for Australia, Canada, and New Zealand for the early post-World War II period, which showed high growth despite large public debts, while including data for the United States for the same period that showed negative GDP growth, which Herndon attributed to demobilization of U.S. military personnel. Also, by using only one year's data for New Zealand, a negative 7.6% GDP growth in 1951, a year in which New Zealand's trade suffered from a major strike, the average central tendency of the available 5 years (1946\u20131949 and 1951) shifted from 2.6% to \u22127.6%.HAP concluded that the \"combination of the collapse of the empirical result that high public debt is inevitably associated with greatly reduced GDP growth and the weakness of the theoretical mechanism under current conditions... render the Reinhart and Rogoff point close to irrelevant for current public policy debate.\"RR published a lengthy, detailed response to HAP in The New York Times:\nHerndon, Ash and Pollin accurately point out the coding error that omits several countries from the averages in figure 2. Full stop. HAP are on point.... HAP go on to note some other missing debt data points [New Zealand], which they describe as \"selective omissions.\" This charge, which permeates through their paper, is one we object to in the strongest terms.... Data for New Zealand for the years around WWII had just been incorporated and we had not vetted the comparability and quality data with data for the more recent period.... They argue that we use an \"unconventional weighting of summary statistics.\" In particular, for each bucket, we take average growth rates for each country and then take an average of the result. This seems perfectly natural to us, and hardly unconventional.\nEconomics professor L. Randall Wray criticized Reinhart and Rogoff for combining data \"across centuries, exchange rate regimes, public and private debt, and debt denominated in foreign currency as well as domestic currency,\" in addition to \"statistical errors,\" and for lacking a \"theory of sovereign currency\".Other critiques point out that any correspondence between debt levels and insufficient economic growth could just as easily be reversed: it is the weak economic growth that leads to the high debt levels. Others have argued that the relationship between debt and growth varies significantly between countries, meaning that an average \"rule\", such as that suggested by Reinhart and Rogoff, has little meaning or policy relevance.Economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote in 2013:\nWhat the Reinhart-Rogoff affair shows is the extent to which austerity has been sold on false pretenses. For three years, the turn to austerity has been presented not as a choice but as a necessity. Economic research, austerity advocates insisted, showed that terrible things happen once debt exceeds 90 percent of G.D.P.

Woodlore sees the fish disappearing before his eyes, so he decides to stock the lake with some more. As he heads to the fish hatchery, he sees Humphrey with a few fishing nets and rods, and asks him what he is doing. When the bear tells him that he is going to catch some fish, Woodlore takes the rods and nets and tells him to \"Go fish like a bear!\" At the hatchery, Woodlore selects an envelope of fish eggs from a collection of eggs. He fills a tub with water and inserts the eggs into it. In a matter of seconds, several fishes pop up out of the water like plants out of soil.\nWhen the ranger gets to the lake to dump the fish, he finds Humphrey in there, trying to eat one of the small fishes, which is then consumed by a much larger fish. Humphrey manages to remove the small fish from the mouth of the large fish, and then uses it to lure five other large fishes that jump out of the water, but then Woodlore appears to measure the fish, while at the same time punishing Humphrey by hitting him on the head, causing him to sink into the depths of the lake. When Humphrey grabs some more fish and emerges from the lake, he discovers a fish larger than any of the others; this turns out to be a fish balloon with which a young boy is playing. Humphrey pops the balloon, and both the boy and Woodlore kick the bear in the knee which the latter told Humphrey to leave the kid alone when Humphrey told Woodlore what happen.\nHumphrey then tries to think of another way to foil the anglers; noticing the boy from before walking along the lake with a toy boat, he removes the bottom from the boat, ties it onto his head like a hat, and then submerges himself into the lake so that the hat looks like a shark's dorsal fin to the anglers, causing them to flee in terror. Humphrey then takes all of the anglers' bags of fish, but upon seeing the ranger, he loads the fish into Woodlore's helicopter, giving him more of a full load than he was expecting. He then decides to stuff himself into the plane, which proves to be too small for him and the fish, and then all of the fish in the helicopter, along with Humphrey, are deposited into the lake.\nWoodlore then gets a telephone call from the chief of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, who tells him to stop stocking the lake, as fishing season ended yesterday. The ranger then takes out his scissors and cuts the rods of various anglers, and then locates Humphrey and informs him that fishing season is over. He then paints a red X over the \"Fishing Season\" sign and flips it over to reveal the message \"Hunting Season Open\". At this, Humphrey gets hunted, with shots firing at him from all directions, and running about as the cartoon closes. (Which reused animation from Rugged Bear)", "hasanswer": false}]}

He researches the artifact but finds little further information.  The ancient (though its age is debated) monolith stands near to the village of Stregoicavar (\"meaning something like Witch-Town\") in the mountains of Hungary.  There are many superstitions surrounding it, for instance anyone who sleeps nearby will suffer nightmares for the rest of their life and anyone who visits the stone on Midsummer Night will go insane and die. Though the Monolith is hated and disliked by all in the village, it is said by the Innskeeper that \"Any man who lay hammer or maul to it die evilly\", so the villagers simply shun the stone.\nThe narrator decides to travel to Stregoicavar on vacation.   Along the way he hears of the local history and sees the site of an old battlefield, where Count Boris Vladinoff fought the invading Suleiman the Magnificent in 1526.  Local stories say that Vladinoff took shelter in a ruined castle and was brought a lacquered case that had been found near the body of Selim Bahadur, \"the famous Turkish scribe and historian\", who had died in a recent battle.  The unnamed contents scared the Count but at that moment Turkish artillery destroyed a part of the castle and he got buried in the rubble, where his bones still remain.\nReaching the village, the narrator interviews some of the villagers.  The current inhabitants are not the original people of the village - they were all wiped out by the Turkish invasion in 1526.  They are said to have been of a different, unknown, race than the Hungarians with a reputation for raiding their villages and kidnapping women and children.  A school teacher reveals that according to legend, the original name for the village was Xuthltan and the stone was worshiped by pagans at one time (although they probably did not erect it themselves).  The black stone is \"octagonal in shape, some sixteen feet in height and about a foot and a half thick.\"\nA week after arriving the narrator realizes that it is Midsummer Night and makes his way to the stone.  He falls asleep an hour before midnight but wakes to find the chanting and dancing people around the stone. After much dancing, during which the narrator is unable to move or do anything but observe, a baby is killed in sacrifice.  Shortly a giant toad-like monster appears at the top of the stone and a second sacrifice, a young girl, is offered to it.  The narrator faints at this point and decides that it was a dream when he wakes again. But slowly, he realizes that it was no dream. He remembers that Selim Bahadur's case was still with the Count's bones which hadn't been disturbed. The narrator unearths the nobleman's remains and with them, the case belonging to the Turk. He translates the account written by the historian and is horrified by his account of what happened near the Black Stone, how the monstrous creature slaughtered at least ten men before being killed by steel weapons blessed by Muhammad.

{"id": "1433_167", "question": "What larger work was the Bread of Life Discourse published in?", "ctxs": [{"id": "69_3573", "text": "Kierkegaard published some of his works using pseudonyms and for others he signed his own name as author. Whether being published under pseudonym or not, Kierkegaard's central writing on religion was Fear and Trembling, and Either/Or is considered to be his magnum opus. Pseudonyms were used often in the early 19th century as a means of representing viewpoints other than the author's own. Kierkegaard employed the same technique as a way to provide examples of indirect communication. In writing under various pseudonyms to express sometimes contradictory positions, Kierkegaard is sometimes criticized for playing with various viewpoints without ever committing to one in particular. He has been described by those opposing his writings as indeterminate in his standpoint as a writer, though he himself has testified to all his work deriving from a service to Christianity. After On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates, his 1841 master's thesis under Frederik Christian Sibbern, he wrote his first book under the pseudonym \"Johannes Climacus\" (after John Climacus) between 1841 and 1842. De omnibus dubitandum est (Latin: \"Everything must be doubted\") was not published until after his death.\nKierkegaard's magnum opus Either/Or was published 20 February 1843; it was mostly written during Kierkegaard's stay in Berlin, where he took notes on Schelling's Philosophy of Revelation. Either/Or includes essays of literary and music criticism and a set of romantic-like aphorisms, as part of his larger theme of examining the reflective and philosophical structure of faith. Edited by \"Victor Eremita\", the book contained the papers of an unknown \"A\" and \"B\" which the pseudonymous author claimed to have discovered in a secret drawer of his secretary. Eremita had a hard time putting the papers of \"A\" in order because they were not straightforward. \"B\"'s papers were arranged in an orderly fashion. Both of these characters are trying to become religious individuals. Each approached the idea of first love from an aesthetic and an ethical point of view. The book is basically an argument about faith and marriage with a short discourse at the end telling them they should stop arguing. Eremita thinks \"B\", a judge, makes the most sense. Kierkegaard stressed the \"how\" of Christianity as well as the \"how\" of book reading in his works rather than the \"what\".Three months after the publication of Either/Or, 16 May 1843, he published Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 and continued to publish discourses along with his pseudonymous books. These discourses were published under Kierkegaard's own name and are available as Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses today. David F. Swenson first translated the works in the 1940s and titled them the Edifying Discourses; however, in 1990, Howard V. and Edna H. Hong translated the works again but called them the Upbuilding Discourses. The word \"upbuilding\" was more in line with Kierkegaard's thought after 1846, when he wrote Christian deliberations about Works of Love. An upbuilding discourse or edifying discourse isn't the same as a sermon because a sermon is preached to a congregation while a discourse can be carried on between several people or even with oneself. The discourse or conversation should be \"upbuilding\", which means one would build up the other person, or oneself, rather than tear down to build up. Kierkegaard said: \"Although this little book (which is called 'discourses', not sermons, because its author does not have authority to preach, 'upbuilding discourses', not discourses for upbuilding, because the speaker by no means claims to be a teacher) wishes to be only what it is, a superfluity, and desires only to remain in hiding\".On 16 October 1843, Kierkegaard published three more books about love and faith and several more discourses. Fear and Trembling was published under the pseudonym Johannes de Silentio. Repetition is about a Young Man (S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard) who has anxiety and depression because he feels he has to sacrifice his love for a girl (Regine Olsen) to God. He tries to see if the new science of psychology can help him understand himself. Constantin Constantius, who is the pseudonymous author of that book, is the psychologist. At the same time, he published Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 under his own name, which dealt specifically with how love can be used to hide things from yourself or others. These three books, all published on the same day, are an example of Kierkegaard's method of indirect communication.\nKierkegaard questioned whether an individual can know if something is a good gift from God or not and concludes by saying, \"it does not depend, then, merely upon what one sees, but what one sees depends upon how one sees; all observation is not just a receiving, a discovering, but also a bringing forth, and insofar as it is that, how the observer himself is constituted is indeed decisive.\" God's love is imparted indirectly just as our own sometimes is.During 1844, he published two, three, and four more upbuilding discourses just as he did in 1843, but here he discussed how an individual might come to know God. Theologians, philosophers and historians were all engaged in debating about the existence of God. This is direct communication and Kierkegaard thinks this might be useful for theologians, philosophers, and historians (associations) but not at all useful for the \"single individual\" who is interested in becoming a Christian. Kierkegaard always wrote for \"that single individual whom I with joy and gratitude call my reader\"; the single individual must put what is understood to use or it will be lost. Reflection can take an individual only so far before the imagination begins to change the whole content of what was being thought about. Love is won by being exercised just as much as faith and patience are.\nHe also wrote several more pseudonymous books in 1844: Philosophical Fragments, Prefaces and The Concept of Anxiety and finished the year up with Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1844. He used indirect communication in the first book and direct communication in the rest of them. He doesn't believe the question about God's existence should be an opinion held by one group and differently by another no matter how many demonstrations are made. He says it's up to the single individual to make the fruit of the Holy Spirit real because love and joy are always just possibilities. Christendom wanted to define God's attributes once and for all but Kierkegaard was against this. His love for Regine was a disaster but it helped him because of his point of view.Kierkegaard believed \"each generation has its own task and need not trouble itself unduly by being everything to previous and succeeding generations\". In an earlier book he had said, \"to a certain degree every generation and every individual begins his life from the beginning\", and in another, \"no generation has learned to love from another, no generation is able to begin at any other point than the beginning\", \"no generation learns the essentially human from a previous one.\" And, finally, in 1850 he wrote, \"those true Christians who in every generation live a life contemporaneous with that of Christ have nothing whatsoever to do with Christians of the preceding generation, but all the more with their contemporary, Christ. His life here on earth attends every generation, and every generation severally, as Sacred History...\" But in 1848, \"The whole generation and every individual in the generation is a participant in one's having faith.\"\nHe was against the Hegelian idea of mediation because it introduces a \"third term\" that comes between the single individual and the object of desire. Kierkegaard wrote in 1844, 'If a person can be assured of the grace of God without needing temporal evidence as a middleman or as the dispensation advantageous to him as interpreter, then it is indeed obvious to him that the grace of God is the most glorious of all.\" He was against mediation and settled instead on the choice to be content with the grace of God or not. It's the choice between the possibility of the \"temporal and the eternal\", \"mistrust and belief, and deception and truth\", \"subjective and objective\". These are the \"magnitudes\" of choice. He always stressed deliberation and choice in his writings and wrote against comparison. This is how Kant put it in 1786 and Kierkegaard put it in 1847: Thinking for one's self is to seek the chief touchstone of truth in one's self (id est, in one's own reason); and the maxim, to think for one's self at all times is Enlightening. Thereto belongs not just so much, as those may imagine who take knowledge, to be enlightening; as it is rather a negative principle in the use of one's cognoscitive faculty, and he, who is very rich in knowledge, is often the least enlightened in the use of it. To exercise one's own reason, means nothing more, than, relatively to every thing which one is to suppose, to question one's self.\nWorldly worry always seeks to lead a human being into the small-minded unrest of comparisons, away from the lofty calmness of simple thoughts. To be clothed, then, means to be a human being\u2014and therefore to be well clothed. Worldly worry is preoccupied with clothes and dissimilarity of clothes.  Should not the invitation to learn from the lilies be welcome to everyone just as the reminder is useful to him! Alas, those great, uplifting, simple thoughts, those first thoughts, are more and more forgotten, perhaps entirely forgotten in the weekday and worldly life of comparisons. The one human being compares himself with others, the one generation compares itself with the other, and thus the heaped up pile of comparisons overwhelms a person. As the ingenuity and busyness increase, there come to be more and more in each generation who slavishly work a whole lifetime far down in the low underground regions of comparisons. Indeed, just as miners never see the light of day, so these unhappy people never come to see the light: those uplifting, simple thoughts, those first thoughts about how glorious it is to be a human being. And up there in the higher regions of comparison, smiling vanity plays its false game and deceives the happy ones so that they receive no impression from those lofty, simple thoughts, those first thoughts.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1817, Shelley began writing the poem \"Ozymandias\", after the British Museum acquired the Younger Memnon, a head-and-torso fragment of a statue of Ramesses II, which dated from the 13th century BC. Earlier, in 1816, the Italian archeologist Giovanni Battista Belzoni had removed the 7.25-short-ton (6.58 t; 6,580 kg) statue fragment from the Ramesseum, the mortuary temple of Ramesses II at Thebes, Egypt. The reputation of the statue fragment preceded its arrival to Western Europe; after his Egyptian expedition in 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte had failed to acquire the Younger Memnon for France. Although the British Museum expected delivery of the antiquity in 1818, the Younger Memnon did not arrive in London until 1821.\nShelley published his poems before the statue fragment of Ozymandias arrived in Britain, and the view of modern scholarship is that Shelley never saw the statue, although he might have learned about it from news reports, as it was well known even in its previous location near Luxor.The book Les Ruines, ou m\u00e9ditations sur les r\u00e9volutions des empires (1791) by Constantin Fran\u00e7ois de Chasseb\u0153uf, comte de Volney (1757\u20131820), first published in an English translation as The Ruins, or a Survey of the Revolutions of Empires (London: Joseph Johnson, 1792) by James Marshall, was an influence on Shelley.

The New International editions continued to offer words and features not covered by the OED, and vice versa. In the 1970s, the OED began publishing Supplements to its dictionary and in 1989 integrated the new words in the supplements with the older definitions and etymologies in its Second Edition.\nBetween the 1930s and the 1950s, several college dictionaries, notably the American College Dictionary and (non-Merriam) Webster's New World Dictionary, entered the market alongside the Collegiate. Among larger dictionaries during this period was (non-Merriam) Webster's Universal Dictionary (also published as Webster's Twentieth Century Dictionary) which traced its roots to Noah Webster and called itself \"unabridged\", but had less than half the vocabulary and paled in scholarship against the Merriam editions.\nAfter the commercial success of Webster's Third New International in the 1960s, Random House responded by adapting its college dictionary by adding more illustrations and large numbers of proper names, increasing its print size and page thickness, and giving it a heavy cover. In 1966, it was published as a new \"unabridged\" dictionary. It was expanded in 1987, but it still covered no more than half the actual vocabulary of Webster's Third.\nThe American Heritage Publishing Co., highly critical of Webster's Third, failed in an attempt to buy out Merriam-Webster and determined to create its own dictionary, The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. In 1969, it issued a college-sized dictionary. Now in its fifth edition, it is only slightly greater in vocabulary than the Collegiate, but it appears much larger and has the appeal of many pictures and other features, such as a usage panel of language professionals which is polled for the acceptability of certain word usage, and a discussion for some entries of subtle differences among words with similar meaning. Other medium-sized dictionaries have since entered the market, including the New Oxford American and the Encarta Webster's, while Merriam-Webster has not attempted to compete by issuing a similar edition.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "1433_175", "question": "What magazine was \"Into the Comet\" published in?", "ctxs": [{"id": "184_65252", "text": "In 1618, the year Guiducci became consul of the Accademia Fiorentina, a particularly bright and long-lasting comet was seen in the skies over Europe, and soon afterwards an anonymous pamphlet was published in Rome entitled \"De Tribus Cometis Anni MDCXVIII\". The pamphlet argued that comet was a real phenomenon and not an optical illusion or atmospheric effect. The author was the Jesuit Orazio Grassi. There were a number of arguments in this which Galileo wanted to counter, but he decided that it would be wise not to publish his arguments under his own name, so he collaborated with Guiducci to produce a text, Discourse on Comets, which Guiducci read out at the Accademia Fiorentina in May 1619 and published the next month.The Discourse on comets, although formally a response to Grassi, was fundamentally a rebuttal of the arguments made by Tycho Brahe. It argued that the absence of parallax observable with comets meant that they were not real objects, but atmospheric effects, like rainbows.  (In fact the apparent lack of parallax is due immense distance of comets from the earth). Galileo (through Guiducci) also argued against Tycho's case for comets having uniform, circular paths. Instead, he maintained, their paths were straight. As well as attacking Grassi, the Discourse also continued an earlier dispute with Christoph Scheiner about sunspots, belittling the illustrations in Scheiner's book as 'badly coloured and poorly drawn.'While Guiducci and Galileo were working in the Discourse, a second anonymous Jesuit pamphlet appeared in Milan - Assemblea Celeste Radunata Nuovamente in Parnasso Sopra la Nuova Cometa (sometimes wrongly attributed to Giovanni Rho). This argued for the new model of the universe proposed by Tycho Brahe and against the traditional cosmology of Aristotle. Guiducci and Galileo collaborated on a response to this as well, which set out the arguments for a heliocentric model. The debate continued when, in Perugia later in 1619, Grassi published a reply to the Discourse in La Libra Astronomica ac Philosophica under the pen-name Lotario Sarsi Sigensano. This work dismissed Guiducci as a mere 'copyist' for Galileo, and attacked Galileo's ideas directly. While the Accademia dei Lincei were considering what tone a reply from Galileo ought to take, Guiducci replied directly to Grassi in the Spring of 1620. The reply was formally addressed to another Jesuit, Father Tarquinio Galluzzi, his old rhetoric master. Guiducci countered the various arguments Grassi had put forward against Galileo, describing some of Grassi's experiments as 'full of errors and not without a hint of fraud.' Guiducci concluded with an attempt to reconcile experimental evidence with theological arguments, but firmly asserted the primacy of data gathered through observation. Galileo was very pleased with Guiducci's efforts, proposing him for membership of the Accademia dei Lincei in May 1621 (although he did not actually become a member until 1625).In public, Galileo insisted that Guiducci, and not he, was the author of the Discourse on Comets.  In 1623, in the opening section of Il Saggiatore (The Assayer) he complained:\n\n'One might have thought that Sig. Mario Guiducci would be allowed to lecture in his Academy, carrying out the duties of his office there, and even to publish his Discourse on Comets without \"Lothario Sarsi\" a person never heard of before, jumping upon me for this. Why has he considered me the author of this Discourse without showing any respect for that fine man who was? I had no part in it beyond the honor and regard shown me by Guiducci in concurring with the opinions I had expressed in discussions with him and other gentlemen. And even if the entire Discourse were the work of my pen - a thing that would never enter the mind of anyone who knows Guiducci - what kind of behavior is this for Sarsi to unmask me and reveal my face so zealously? Should I not have been showing a wish to remain incognito?'\nDespite Galileo's public protestations, there is no doubt whatever that he was the main author of the Discourse on Comets.  The manuscript is largely in Galileo's handwriting, and the sections in Guiducci's hand have been revised and corrected by Galileo.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The original Skull Man was one of the first antiheroes to be seen in manga, someone who would sacrifice the lives of innocents in his quest for vengeance.\nWhile developing the Kamen Rider (Masked Rider) TV series along with producer Toru Hirayama, Ishinomori created this manga as his own personal version, which the producers at Toei Company Ltd. used as the basis for the show.

{"id": "1433_177", "question": "What larger work was \"The Wife's Lament\" published in?", "ctxs": [{"id": "1433_69664", "text": "Though the description of the text as a woman's song or frauenlied\u2014lamenting for a lost or absent lover\u2014is the dominant understanding of the poem, the text has nevertheless been subject to a variety of distinct treatments that fundamentally disagree with this view and propose alternatives. One such treatment considers the poem to be allegory, in which interpretation the lamenting speaker represents the Church as Bride of Christ or as an otherwise feminine allegorical figure. Another dissenting interpretation holds that the speaker, who describes herself held within an old earth cell (eald is \u00fees eor\u00f0sele) beneath an oak tree (under actreo), may indeed literally be located in a cell under the earth, and would therefore constitute a voice of the deceased, speaking from beyond the grave. Both the interpretations, as with most alternatives, face difficulties, particularly in the latter case, for which no analogous texts exist in the Old English corpus.\nThe status of the poem as a lament spoken by a female protagonist is therefore fairly well established in criticism. Interpretations that attempt a treatment diverging from this, though diverse in their approach, bear a fairly heavy burden of proof. Thematic consistencies between the Wife's Lament and its close relative in the genre of the woman's song, as well as close neighbour in the Exeter Book, Wulf and Eadwacer, make unconventional treatments somewhat counterintuitive. A final point of divergence, however, between the conventional interpretation and variants proceeds from the similarity of the poem in some respects to elegiac poems in the Old English corpus that feature male protagonists. Similarities between the language and circumstances of the male protagonist of The Wanderer, for example, and the protagonist of the Wife's Lament have led other critics to argue, even more radically, that the protagonist of the poem (to which the attribution of the title \"the wife's lament\" is wholly apocryphal and fairly recent) may in fact be male. This interpretation, however, faces the almost insurmountable problem that adjectives and personal nouns occurring within the poem (geomorre, minre, sylfre) are feminine in grammatical gender. This interpretation is at the very least dependent therefore on a contention that perhaps a later Anglo-Saxon copyist has wrongly imposed feminine gender on the protagonist where this was not the original authorial intent, and such contentions almost wholly relegate discussion to the realm of the hypothetical. It is also thought by some that The Wife's Lament and The Husband's Message may be part of a larger work.The poem is also considered by some to be a riddle poem.  A riddle poem contains a lesson told in cultural context which would be understandable or relates to the reader, and was a very popular genre of poetry of the time period.  Gnomic wisdom is also a characteristic of a riddle poem, and is present in the poem's closing sentiment (lines 52-53). Also, it cannot be ignored that contained within the Exeter Book are 92 other riddle poems.  According to Faye Walker-Pelkey, \"The Lament's placement in the Exeter Book, its mysterious content, its fragmented structure, its similarities to riddles, and its inclusion of gnomic wisdom suggest that the \"elegy\"...is a riddle.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

He became friends with and was influenced by modernist writers such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ford Madox Ford, James Joyce, Ezra Pound and Gertrude Stein. The year 1923 saw his first published work, a slim volume titled Three Stories and Ten Poems, followed the next year by another collection of short vignettes, in our time (without capitals).  Hoping to have in our time published in New York, in 1924 he began writing stories to add to the volume with \"Big Two-Hearted River\" planned as the final piece. He started writing the story in May of that year but did not finish until September as he spent the summer helping Ezra Pound and Ford Madox Ford launch the journal the transatlantic review.\n\"Big Two-Hearted River\" has strong autobiographical elements. During World War I, Hemingway signed on as a member of the Red Cross at age 19,  and was sent to the Italian Front at Fossalta as an ambulance driver. On his first day there, he helped to retrieve the remains of female workers killed in a munitions factory explosion, about which he later wrote in Death in the Afternoon: \"I remember that after we searched quite thoroughly for the complete dead we collected fragments\". A few days later, on July 8, 1918, he was severely wounded when a mortar bomb exploded between his legs. He was sent to a hospital in Milan where he recuperated for six months; after his return home, he went on a week-long fishing and camping trip in September 1919 with two high school friends to the backcountry near Seney in Michigan's Upper Peninsula\u2014a trip that became the inspiration for \"Big Two-Hearted River\". The manuscript shows the use of plural pronouns, suggesting that in an early version more characters were included, but by publication any mention of his friends or the townspeople had been removed\u2014leaving Nick alone in the woods.Hemingway gave the draft to Stein to read in October 1925; she advised cutting the 11-page section of stream-of-consciousness reminiscences written from Nick's point of view. Hemingway took her advice, reworked the ending, and wrote to his editor: \"I have discovered that the last eleven pages of the last story in the book are crap\". Biographer James Mellow writes that at this early stage in his career Hemingway had not developed his talent enough to fully and capably integrate self-reflections in his writing; Mellow also believes the deleted passage might have been a \"tour-de-force\" had it been written at a more mature period in Hemingway's development.In January 1925, while wintering in Schruns, Austria, waiting for a response from query letters written to friends and publishers in America, Hemingway submitted the story to be published in his friend Ernest Walsh's newly established literary magazine This Quarter. Walsh bought it for 1,000 French francs, the highest payment Hemingway had yet received for a piece of fiction. On October 5, 1925, the expanded edition of In Our Time (with conventional capitalization in the title) was published by Boni & Liveright in New York. The last story in the volume was the two-part \"Big Two-Hearted River\". The piece was later included in Hemingway's collection The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories published in October 1938, and in two collections of short stories published after his death, The Nick Adams Stories (1972) and The Complete Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway: The Finca Vig\u00eda Edition (1987).

The painting depicts the mythological Minotaur as a solitary and seemingly lonely creature, leaning on a parapet and staring longingly at the sea while gripping a crushed bird in his hand.Borges's composition of \"The House of Asterion\" and other short stories in The Aleph coincided with his turbulent relationship with Argentine writer Estela Canto. Borges first met Canto in 1944 and proposed to her only a year later; but their relationship ended in July 1946 after Canto came to resent Borges's mother, whom she found to be overly controlling of him. Edwin Williamson, one of Borges's biographers, wrote that Canto's desertion of Borges and his subsequent unhappiness influenced elements of  \"The House of Asterion\", including the title character's extreme loneliness and desire to be liberated from his monotonous existence.\nAccording to Norman Thomas di Giovanni, an editor and translator who frequently collaborated with Borges, \"The House of Asterion\" was written over a period of two days in 1947, after Borges discovered that he had two blank pages to fill in Los Anales de Buenos Aires, the literary magazine he edited. Modern analyses of Borges's original handwritten manuscript, which is kept at the University of Virginia, have revealed the revisions he made to earlier drafts of the work in order to more effectively disguise the narrator's identity in the story's beginning. For instance, Borges replaced the phrase \"los griegos\" (the Greeks) with \"los hombres\" (the men) in the third sentence, removing a potential intimation of Greek mythology. Analyses of Borges's revisions have also suggested that, while writing the story, he experimented with various framings of the reveal of Asterion's identity, deliberating on whether to explicitly name the Minotaur's labyrinth and to mention the nature of Theseus's weapon.The original Spanish-language version of \"The House of Asterion\" was published in print in the May\u2013June 1947 edition of Los Anales de Buenos Aires. It was accompanied by an illustration, by Austrian artist Marie Elisabeth Wrede, depicting Asterion slumped on the ground with his head covered by a shroud, as Theseus stands over him, sword in hand.

The reviewer also complained of targeting problems but gave the game a strong recommendation due to \"the fun of cruising the halls, wiping out aliens, and torching and detonating the area.\" A reviewer for Maximum likewise was pleased with the sound effects but felt the graphics to be authentic to the films yet unimpressive, remarking that the animation on the aliens is a severe disappointment after Acclaim's considerable boasting about their new motion capture technology. He also criticized the slow pace and weak weapons, but praised the game's limited field of vision for creating a claustrophobic, suspenseful atmosphere and concluded that Alien Trilogy \"is far more impressive than the mediocre offerings PlayStation owners have had to put up with over the last few months, with a depth of gameplay and audio-visual quality which is sure to impress just about everyone who buys it.\" A Next Generation critic hailed the game as both a strong first-person shooter and an excellent adaptation of the film series, and said the opening full motion video \"is one of the best intros we've seen.\" While citing minor issues with confusing level designs, he emphasized that \"The details, however, are what make this come alive: face huggers scuttle away, full grown aliens drop down from above, alien queens are not easy to kill, glass shatters, barrels explode, and, for the most part, the way it controls is so smooth and intuitive that the experience is very close to finding yourself in the middle of the film.\" IGN criticized the confusing level layout but praised the intuitive controls, interactive environment, and generally strong film-to-video-game translation.The Saturn port was also positively received. A Next Generation critic hailed it as a rare example of a PlayStation-to-Saturn port which is just as good as the PlayStation original. However, GameSpot and GamePro said the graphics are not as \"crisp\" as the PlayStation version, though still good in absolute terms. Sega Saturn Magazine's Rad Automatic did not mention the PlayStation version at all. Both he and GameSpot focused their praises on the game's effective use of sound to create atmosphere and clue the player in to the close proximity of unseen enemies. Despite their positive assessments, GamePro and Sega Saturn Magazine both said the game fell second to PowerSlave, another first-person shooter released for the Saturn at roughly the same time.Alien Trilogy was a finalist for the Computer Game Developers Conference's 1996 \"Best Adaptation of Linear Media\" Spotlight Award, but lost the prize to I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream. It was awarded Electronic Gaming Monthly's Shooter Game of the Year. In 1996, GamesMaster rated the game 46th in their \"Top 100 Games of All Time.\"In a retrospective review, Irwin Fletcher of Game Revolution praised the high production values, commenting that \"Alien Trilogy is nothing revolutionary, but it's a damn good shooter.\"The PlayStation version was a bestseller in the UK.", "hasanswer": false}]}

This is certainly not the last, but subsequent stories rarely focus on it.\nScrooge's effort this time is not to gain treasure, but find some peace and regain his health. However, as so often presented in Barks tales, in trying to escape his problems he only manages to carry them with him. Tralla La's (based on Shangri-La) inhabitants prove to share the human characteristic of greed, while Barks is allowed some bitter commentary on human nature and the impact of \"inventing\" money.\nThe theme of never finding peace no matter how hard the characters try is a running theme in Barks' tales, but here it takes center place. It is considered among Barks' most memorable because of its view of humanity, paradise, and the vulnerability of his characters.\nThis story features the first appearance of that inexhaustible font of knowledge, The Junior Woodchucks' Guidebook.The story was later adapted into an episode of DuckTales.\nDon Rosa wrote a sequel to the story, Return To Xanadu, in which Tralla La is revealed to be the valley of Xanadu.

Pharaoh Seti, fearing that the growing numbers of Hebrews could lead to rebellion, orders a mass infanticide of all newborn Hebrew boys. Yocheved and her children, Miriam and Aaron, rush to the Nile River, where she places her newborn son in a basket on the water, bidding him farewell with a final lullaby. Miriam follows the basket as it floats to Seti's palace and witnesses her brother safely adopted by Seti's wife, Queen Tuya, who names him Moses. Before leaving, Miriam prays that Moses will return to free the Hebrews.\nYears later, Moses and his adoptive brother Rameses, heir to the throne of Egypt, are scolded by Seti for accidentally destroying a temple. After Moses suggests that Rameses be given the opportunity to prove his responsibility, Seti names Rameses prince regent. High priests Hotep and Huy offer Rameses a beautiful but rebellious young Midianite woman, Tzipporah. Moses humiliates Tzipporah by letting her fall into a pond after she refuses to submit, appeasing the crowd but disappointing Tuya. Rameses gives Tzipporah to Moses and appoints him Royal Chief Architect.\nLater that night, Moses follows Tzipporah as she escapes from the palace, choosing not to stop her. He runs into the now-adult Miriam and Aaron whom he does not recognize. He disbelieves their claims and almost has them arrested until Miriam sings their mother's lullaby, triggering Moses's memory. He flees in denial, but learns the truth of Seti's genocide from a nightmare, then from Seti himself, who disturbs Moses by claiming the Hebrews were \"only slaves\". The next day, Moses tries to stop an Egyptian slave driver from flogging an elderly Hebrew slave, accidentally pushing the slave driver to his death. Horrified and ashamed, Moses flees into the desert in exile, despite Rameses's pleas that he stay.\nArriving at an oasis, Moses defends three girls from brigands, only to realize their older sister is Tzipporah. Moses is welcomed by Jethro, Tzipporah's father and the high priest of Midian, who helps Moses gain a more positive outlook on life. Moses becomes a shepherd, falls in love with Tzipporah, marries her, and grows adjusted to life in Midian. Moses discovers a burning bush, through which God tells him to return to Egypt and free the Hebrews. God bestows Moses's shepherding staff with his power and promises that he will tell Moses what to say. When Moses tells Tzipporah of his task, she decides to join him.\nArriving in Egypt, Moses is happily greeted by Rameses, who is now Pharaoh with a wife and son. Moses demands the Hebrews' release and transforms his staff into a snake to demonstrate God's power. Hotep and Huy deceptively recreate this transformation, only to have their snakes eaten by Moses's. Not wanting to have his actions cause the empire's collapse and feeling betrayed by Moses, Rameses denies Moses's demand and doubles the Hebrews' workload.\nThe Hebrews, including Aaron, blame Moses for their increased workload, discouraging Moses, but Miriam inspires Moses to persevere. Moses casts the first of the Ten Plagues of Egypt by changing the waters of the Nile into blood, but Rameses remains unmoved. God inflicts eight more plagues onto Egypt, including the plagues of frogs, boils, and hailfire, but still Rameses refuses to relent, vowing never to release the Hebrews. Disheartened, Moses prepares the Hebrews for the tenth plague, instructing them to sacrifice a lamb and mark their doorposts with its blood. That night, the final plague kills all the firstborn children of Egypt, including Rameses's young son, while passing over the Hebrews' marked homes. Grief-stricken, Rameses gives the Hebrews permission to leave. After leaving the palace, Moses collapses in anguish and remorse.\nThe following morning, Moses, Miriam, Aaron and Tzipporah lead the Hebrews out of Egypt. Once at the Red Sea, a vengeful Rameses pursues them with his army, intent on killing them. However, a pillar of fire blocks the army's way, while Moses uses his staff to part the sea. The Hebrews cross the open sea bottom; the fire vanishes and the army gives chase, but the sea closes over and drowns the Egyptian soldiers, sparing Rameses alone. Moses mournfully bids Rameses farewell and leads the Hebrews to Mount Sinai, where he receives the Ten Commandments.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Stephen Schwartz, the composer behind the Broadway theater hits Godspell (1971), Pippin (1972), and The Magic Show (1974), received a call from the company asking if he would like to collaborate with Menken. Schwartz had never considered working in the film industry, but agreed to do so nonetheless. Schwartz did not feel he was well-suited to the job.Schwartz wanted to write a song for the film wherein Pocahontas confronts the Eurocentrism of John Smith. \"Colors of the Wind\" was the first song written for Pocahontas. According to Schwartz, the song \"influence[d] the development of the rest of the film.\" Schwartz said that \"a story-board outline was in place before we wrote [the track]. This is often the process in animation, at least as I've experienced it, where everybody works from an outline and each succeeding piece of material, whether it is a song or drawings, influences the next.\" The track was inspired by Native American poetry, music and folklore, as well as a now-debunked  letter that Schwartz believed was sent to the United States Congress by Chief Seattle regarding humanity's relationship with nature but was in fact a fabrication. Part of the letter reads: \"The wind that gave our grandfather his first breath also received his last sigh. The wind also gives our children the spirit of life. So if we sell our land, you must keep it apart and sacred, as a place where man can go to taste the wind that is sweetened by the meadow flowers.\" This portion of the letter inspired the song's title, which Schwartz liked because he saw it as paradoxical and thought-provoking.Schwartz also drew inspiration for \"Colors of the Wind\" from the music of Oscar Hammerstein II and Sheldon Harnick, as it deals with issues of prejudice. Menken said that while \"Colors of the Wind\" was \"born out of the modality of Native American music...it quickly moved to its own place, which is hard to define.\" Menken has noted that the song lacks humor, which he and Schwartz attempted to inject into Pocahontas and failed. Initially, the final lines of the song were \"For your life's an empty hull/till you get it through your skull/you can paint with all the colors of the wind.\" Menken disapproved of these lyrics and asked Schwartz to rewrite them; Schwartz changed the lines to \"You can own the Earth, and still/all you'll own is earth until/you can paint with all the colors of the wind.\" Schwartz preferred the altered lyrics. Schwartz said that this incident taught him the lesson: \"If your collaborator is unhappy, it's probably because [the song] needs to be better,\" adding that he may not have won an Academy Award if he did not change the lyrics. Menken views \"Colors of the Wind\" as one of the most important songs he has written. Schwartz believed that the Walt Disney Company would reject \"Colors of the Wind\" for being philosophical and different from previous Disney songs. Judy Kuhn sang the song to help \"pitch\" Schwartz's score to Disney, and the studio embraced the track. Schwartz and Menken became friends, and later wrote music for the Disney films The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) and Enchanted (2007) together.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Hinchliffe, Polish critic Grzegorz Sinko points out that in The Birthday Party \"we see the destruction of the victim from the victim's own point of view:\n\n\"One feels like saying that the two executioners, Goldberg and McCann, stand for all the principles of the state and social conformism. Goldberg refers to his 'job' in a typically Kafka-esque official language which deprives the crimes of all sense and reality\"...[Of Stanley's removal, Sinko adds:] \"Maybe Stanley will meet his death there or maybe he will only receive a conformist brainwashing after which he is promised...many other gifts of civilization...\"\nIn an interview with Mel Gussow, which is about the 1988 Classic Stage Company production of The Birthday Party, later paired with Mountain Language in a 1989 CSC production, in both of which David Strathairn played Stanley, Gussow asked Pinter: \"The Birthday Party has the same story as One for the Road?\"\nIn the original interview first published in The New York Times on 30 December 1988, Gussow quotes Pinter as stating: \"The character of the old man, Petey, says one of the most important lines I've ever written. As Stanley is taken away, Petey says, 'Stan, don't let them tell you what to do.' I've lived that line all my damn life. Never more than now.\"In responding to Gussow's question, Pinter refers to all three plays when he replies: \"It's the destruction of an individual, the independent voice of an individual. I believe that is precisely what the United States is doing to Nicaragua. It's a horrifying act. If you see child abuse, you recognize it and you're horrified. If you do it yourself, you apparently don't know what you're doing.\"As Bob Bows observes in his review of the 2008 Germinal Stage Denver production, whereas at first \" 'The Birthday Party' appears to be a straightforward story of a former working pianist now holed up in a decrepit boarding house,\" in this play as in his other plays, \"behind the surface symbolism...in the silence between the characters and their words, Pinter opens the door to another world, cogent and familiar: the part we hide from ourselves\"; ultimately, \"Whether we take Goldberg and McCann to be the devil and his agent or simply their earthly emissaries, the puppeteers of the church-state apparatus, or some variation thereof, Pinter's metaphor of a bizarre party bookended by birth and death is a compelling take on this blink-of-an-eye we call life.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Bambra thought that \"Literate, macabre doom shambles from each page. Good reading, and a good campaign setting for COC adventures.\"\nIn the October 1988 edition (Issue 138), Ken Rolston gave an overview of the 3rd edition, and placed it ahead of its competitors due to superior campaign setting, tone and atmosphere, the player characters as investigators, and the use of realistic player handouts such as authentic-looking newspaper clippings. Rolston concluded, \"CoC is one of role-playing\u2019s acknowledged classics. Its various supplements over the years have maintained an exceptional level of quality; several, including Shadows of Yog-Sothoth and Masks of Nyarlathotep, deserve consideration among the greatest pinnacles of the fantasy role-playing game design.\"\nIn the June 1990 edition (Issue 158), Jim Bambra liked the updated setting of the 4th edition, placing the game firmly in Lovecraft's 1920s. He also liked the number of adventures included in the 192-page rulebook: \"The fourth edition contains enough adventures to keep any group happily entertained and sanity blasted.\" However, while Cook questioned whether owners of the 2nd or 3rd edition would get good value for their money \u2014 \"You lack only the car-chase rules and the improved layout of the three books in one. The rest of the material has received minor editing but no substantial changes\" \u2014 Cook strongly recommended the new edition to newcomers, saying, \"If you don\u2019t already play CoC, all I can do is urge you to give it a try.... discover for yourself why it has made so many converts since its release.\"\nIn the October 1992 edition (Issue 186), Rick Swan admitted that he was skeptical that the 5th edition would offer anything new, but instead found that the new edition benefited from \"fresh material, judicious editing, and thorough polishes.\" He concluded, \"Few RPGs exceed the CoC game\u2019s scope or match its skillful integration of background and game systems. And there\u2019s no game more fun.\"In his 1990 book The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games, game critic Rick Swan gave the game a top rating of 4 out of 4, calling it \"a masterpiece, easily the best horror RPG ever published and possibly the best RPG, period ... breathtaking in scope and as richly textured as a fine novel. All role-players owe it to themselves to experience this truly remarkable game.\"In Issue 68 of Challenge, Craig Sheeley reviewed the fifth edition and liked the revisions. \"The entire character generation process is highly streamlined and easily illustrated on a two-page flowchart.\" DeJong also liked the inclusion of material from all three of CoC's settings (1890s, 1920s, 1990s), calling it \"One of the best features of this edition.\" And he was very impressed with the layout of the book, commenting, \"The organization and format of this book deserve special mention. I hold that every game company should study this book to learn what to do right.\" DeJong concluded, \"I am seriously impressed with this product.

Editor Paul Pettengale commented: \"Call of Cthulhu is fully deserved of the title as the most popular roleplaying system ever - it's a game that doesn't age, is eminently playable, and which hangs together perfectly. The system, even though it's over ten years old, it still one of the very best you'll find in any roleplaying game. Also, there's not a referee in the land who could say they've read every Lovecraft inspired book or story going, so there's a pretty-well endless supply of scenario ideas. It's simply marvellous.\"Scott Taylor for Black Gate in 2013 rated Call of Cthulhu as #4 in the top ten role-playing games of all time, saying \"With various revisions, but never a full rewrite of its percentile-based system, Call of Cthulhu might be antiquated by today's standards, but remember it is supposed to be set in the 1920s, so to me that seems more than appropriate.\"Call of Cthulhu has been reported to be the second-most popular game played on the virtual table top platform Roll20 in 2021 (the most popular being Dungeons & Dragons). It has also been reported to be have found success especially in Korea and Japan, and to have overtaken D&D in Japan.In his 2023 book Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted up to this point in time, \"roleplaying games are united in one way: In some fashion, they are all power fantasies. Characters go someplace, kill some things, find some loot, and maybe gain enough experience points to unlock their hidden personal potential in the form of new spells or a new power.\" Horvath then pointed out that this game, as the first horror RPG, had an essential difference: \"Horror, as a genre, is generally concerned with powerlessness ... In a complete inversion of other RPGs, characters in Call of Cthulhu are doomed.\" About the game itself, Horvath commented, \"I find Call of Cthulhu unabashedly fun, despite the scares and the despair ...

{"id": "1433_204", "question": "What larger work was Mainstream Science on Intelligence published in?", "ctxs": [{"id": "1433_69766", "text": "A 1995 article by Joseph L. Graves & Amanda Johnson was critical of the scientific basis on which Mainstream Science on Intelligence rested. The article stated that the statements in Mainstream Science on Intelligence ...certainly fall in line with general Euro-American impressions of race and intelligence. The problem, however, is that none of the ideas these psychometricians support have any relation to legitimate scientific inference. Even though individuals like psychologist J. Philippe Rushton have published monumental treatises to support the claim of Nordic racial superiority, and despite the flamboyant approaches of Shockley, Jensen, Herrnstein, and Murray, there remain only two ways the psychometric syllogism can be deemed acceptable-- either: (a) one has little or no knowledge of the broad areas of the scientific method, statistical reasoning, population studies, quantitative genetics, developmental physiology, neurophysiology, environmental toxicology, sociology, educational psychology, economics, and history required to adequately comprehend the issues involved; or (b) one has no desire to examine the facts of this problem objectively.\nIn a posthumous article in 1996, Donald T. Campbell, a former president of the American Psychological Association, included his own analysis of the Wall Street Journal statement, drafted previously as a letter to that newspaper. Campbell first remarked that:\n\nOf the 52 signatories, there were 10 whom I would regard as measurement experts. I do not have a list of those who were asked to sign and refused, but I know they included Lee Cronbach, Robert Sternberg, and myself.\nHe remarked that the rhetorical organization of statements in the letter seemed to him to imply, inadvertently or deliberately, the conclusion that the black-white racial gap had a genetic cause. He said that for statement 5, no provision had been allowed for differences in educational opportunity. Later on regarding statement 14, he judged that the claims for heritability had been made without mentioning that it was based on twin studies, where environmental opportunities had been excluded as possible factors. For statement 23, he said that it was not possible to compare children of black and white parents that were \"equally\" educated, because in these circumstances the opportunities in the quality of education, both before and at college, would differ. For statement 25, Campbell remarked that Jensen had himself published policy recommendations concerning rote learning.As Hauser (2010) reports in his discussion of the editorial, there is not any general agreement about what is meant by intelligence. The editorial gave the following general definition of intelligence:\nIntelligence is a very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience. It is not merely book-learning, a narrow academic skill, or test-taking smarts. Rather, it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings \"catching on,\" \"making sense\" of things, or \"figuring out\" what to do.\nGottfredson (1997b) describes intelligence in her own article in the same volume less broadly as \"the ability to deal with complexity\".  However, the article by Carroll (1997a), one of the signatories of the statement, reviewed the numerous attempts in the academic literature to define what was meant by intelligence and found that there was not any agreement. He cites experts as describing intelligence as \"the total intellectual repertoire of behavioral responses,\" \"some\ngeneral property or quality ... of the brain,\" \"reaction-time and physiological measures,\" \"many different information-processing abilities\" and\n\"the rate with which learning occurs or the time required for learning.\" Plomin & Petrill (1997c) in the same volume describe intelligence as what is measured by intelligence tests: \"What we mean by intelligence is general cognitive functioning (g) as assessed in the psychometric tradition of a general factor derived from a battery of diverse cognitive ability tests\".\nHarrington (1997) gives a point-by-point analysis of the conclusions of the letter. He states that the validity of tests is claimed as a property of the tests, rather than how or where they are used. He questioned the letter's claims about there not being any cultural bias in IQ tests; and that intelligence was a major factor determining fitness in human evolution, something that he argued was inconsistent with the claims of heritability, if the geneticist's version of evolution was being used. Harrington argued that heritability is phylogenetic, not ontogenetic as the letter suggested. He pointed out that the use of the term \"race\" differed from the way geneticists classify population groups. Regarding the assertion that IQ research does not preclude or dictate any particular social policy, Harrington commented that the opinions of Charles Murray concerning social policy have been used by US Congressmen to argue for policy changes.\nThe validity of the \"mainstream science\" described in the editorial was also questioned by Belkhir & Duyme (1998), who argued that the signatories were attempting to revive the \"pseudo-scientific inquiry\" of biological determinism.\nIn a 2001 article in Trends in Cognitive Sciences, Ian J. Deary noted that The Wall Street Journal \"... is an odd place for such a document, and readers might view the signatories as one-sided, largely committed to the psychometrics-based intelligence research they were endorsing\".Alderfer (2003) analysed the editorial as one of five responses to The Bell Curve, a book which he described as \"an attempt to influence both psychological knowledge and U.S. politics\". He concluded that some of the responses, including the editorial, \"fell far short of providing a critical analysis of the book's racially biased argument and did little to reduce the misleading picture of race and IQ that the book promulgated\". More specifically, Alderfer criticized the failure of the psychologists to recognize the effect of such a book on race relations in the US; as well as their failure to discuss the third and last part of the book on the implications for social policy.  He wrote that, \"Some psychologists said they wanted to keep themselves out of the emotional turmoil that had been generated by publication of the Bell Curve ... They might also have wanted to preserve the neutrality of psychology as a science. When examined in the contemporary racial context, however, their action was neither scientifically nor politically neutral. Essentially, they took a stand by not taking a stand. Their stand was not to become involved in how their expertise might be used to affect people's lives ...they missed an opportunity to caution their readers about regressive forces affecting U.S. race relations and to locate the book within that context. They did not fully use the authority based on their expertise to prevent harm.\"\nSchlinger (2003) argued: \n\nWith a few exceptions, the list of cosigners reads like a Who's Who of those theorists (e.g., Thomas J. Bouchard, Jr., John B. Carroll, Raymond B. Cattell, Hans Eysenck, Linda S. Gottfredson, Seymour W. Itzkoff, Arthur R. Jensen, Robert Plomin, J. Philippe Rushton and Vincent Sarich) who have continued Spearman's tradition of factor analyzing intelligence test scores to generate a theory of general intelligence \u2014 g \u2014 and some of whom (e.g., Thomas J. Bouchard, Robert Plomin) believe that behavior genetic research supports the conclusion that g is highly heritable, and others of whom (e.g., Arthur Jensen, J. Philippe Rushton, Seymour Itzkoff) have written highly emotionally charged articles arguing that the research supports the conclusion that group differences on intelligence tests reflect genetic differences.\n\nArmour-Thomas (2003) argued that the statement's claim that IQ tests were unbiased is not accepted by some prominent researchers of psychometrics who have described problems with using tests on population groups with a substantively different cultural background from those for whom the test was originally designed.\nAnthropologist Robert Wald Sussman criticized the statement in his 2014 book The Myth of Race, writing, \"In this letter, the members of the new bigot brigade claimed that since as many as fifty-two scientists signed this letter, the contents of the book [i.e. the Bell Curve] and of the letter must be true. Using this logic, since the vast majority of anthropologists and other social scientists and of geneticists do not agree with the conclusions of this volume, does that mean it must be false? Obviously not. However, it is the actual science that began with Boas and his colleagues and that has continued to this date that makes these authors' beliefs and approach untenable at any level.\"The Southern Poverty Law Center states that some of the editorial's signatories \"...had no relevant qualifications at all. Garrett Hardin, for example, was an ecologist and anti-immigration activist, while Vincent Sarich was an anthropologist who gained notoriety for making racist and homophobic claims in his undergraduate courses (he later admitted to The New York Times that these assertions were not based on established scientific facts).\" After citing Campbell's estimate that only 10 signatories were experts on the measurement of intelligence, the Center noted that \"...at least 20 [signatories] were recipients of money from the Pioneer Fund, including one director of the Fund, R. Travis Osborne, and two future presidents, J. Philippe Rushton and Richard Lynn.\"\nIn a 2015 interview, behavior geneticist Robert Plomin was asked whether he regretted signing the statement.  He reiterated his support for the factual assertions in the letter, but rejected interpretations of that data in The Bell Curve:   Well, I regret it to the extent it's a distraction to my research. But I think the basic facts are there...erm, about heritability of intelligence, and it's just so unfortunate that some of the interpretations [Murray and Herrnstein] made from that data are so, you know, some of them are quite bizarre and I would make just the opposite sorts of interpretations.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He theorises that with the money he could liberate himself from poverty and go on to perform great deeds, and seeks to convince himself that certain crimes are justifiable if they are committed in order to remove obstacles to the higher goals of 'extraordinary' men.
