About its venue he said, \"Playboy magazine, whatever you may say about its content, always did a first-rate job of printing color pictures.\" According to comics commentators Randy Duncan and Matthew J. Smith, the series \"reads today as an amusing look at the evolving mores of the sexual revolution\". Comics editor Monte Beauchamp said that Little Annie Fanny was \"the most elaborate comic strip ever created\" and cartoonist-critic R. C. Harvey called it \"a masterpiece ... the most lavish color comic strip of all time\".Not all were as impressed. Noting that Kurtzman was financially strapped before making his living for twenty-six years from Playboy, historian Paul Buhle wrote: \"The strip had many brilliant early moments, but went downhill as the writer and artist bent to editor Hugh Hefner's demands for as much titillation as possible.\" Cartoonist Art Spiegelman said that Little Annie Fanny devolved from the more interesting Goodman Beaver. Underground cartoonist Robert Crumb, whose career Kurtzman helped launch, scorned Playboy and Annie. Monty Python's Terry Gilliam, the former assistant editor of Help!, said that Little Annie Fanny was not as sharp as Kurtzman's earlier work: \"technically brilliant but ... slightly compromised.\" Art agent and publisher Denis Kitchen, who handles Kurtzman and Eisner's estates, said that \"most Kurtzman devotees would not consider Little Annie Fanny genius work ... [and] some would argue the opposite: that it was genius diluted or degraded\". Kitchen placed the onus on Kurtzman's employer Hefner, who \"was often a punctilious taskmaster with a heavy red pen who often had very different ideas about what was funny or satiric\" and insisted that each strip \"had to include Annie disrobing\". Beauchamp agreed: \"Unfortunately, Hefner was notorious for his heavy editorial hand.\" Duncan and Smith also agreed, and wrote that \"humor sometimes mixes awkwardly with the loaded topics of the era, and some have found Annie's lack of character development and the requisite sexual hijinks an impediment to taking her seriously.\" However, they repeated their respect: \"The eternally innocent Annie performed admirably as a nonjudgmental witness to the changing tides of the sexual revolution.\"American cartoonist Budd Root cited Little Annie Fanny as one of the inspirations for his independent comic book series Cavewoman.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "1433_2", "question": "What was published in Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights?", "ctxs": [{"id": "1433_69006", "text": "Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights lists the prohibited grounds against which discrimination in illegal. The text states that\"The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\"Unlike the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, there is no general right to equal treatment, only in the areas covered by the Convention. However, the article covers an open-ended list of prohibited grounds for discrimination and has been expanded over time to include such grounds as sexual orientation. In the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, the interpretation of the article has expanded over time to include indirect discrimination. Protocol 12 to the European Convention on Human Rights expands on Article 14 to include a freestanding prohibition of discrimination in \"any right set forth by law\". Introduced in 2000, it has been ratified by 20 of 47 Council of Europe states as of 2021.In early cases before the European Court of Human Rights the court assumed that for Article 14 to be relevant, a breach of one of the substantive Convention rights had to have occurred. If the court did find a substantive breach, it would not find it necessary to consider Article 14. In the Belgian Linguistic case in 1968, the Belgian government argued that Article 14 was not relevant unless there was a substantive breach. For the first time, the court rejected this argument. Following this case, the court considers that for Article 14 to be considered \"it suffices that the facts of a case fall within the ambit of another substantive provision of the Convention or its Protocols\".The court focuses on substantive equality rather than formal equality, and therefore it considers affirmative action acceptable in certain circumstances. According to the court's case law, any difference in treatment based on fixed status must be proportional to the justified aims pursued and the margin of appreciation has especially narrowed with regard to different treatment based exclusively on ethnic origin, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. For example, in the 2013 case Vallianatos and Others v. Greece a registered partnership scheme that only recognized different-sex couples was ruled to be a violation of Article 14 because it discriminated against same-sex couples.", "hasanswer": true}]}

{"id": "1433_4", "question": "What was \"The Goose Girl\" published in?", "ctxs": [{"id": "1433_69015", "text": "Despite the story being viewed as obscure, there have been many film versions, from countries ranging from Germany to even America. Falada is often restored to life in film versions, or even spared entirely. While the Queen is implied to have died in the original story, many versions also have her survive to expose the false bride at the wedding. The false bride's motive for suggesting such a cruel punishment varies by retelling; in some, she is simply too ignorant to recognize herself, others have her play along to keep the charade, and others imply she has believed the king is talking about the true bride. Such film versions include:\n\nHarold MacGrath adapted the story into a novel, which was then developed into a 1915 American silent film starring Marguerite Clark. In this version, the princess is stolen at birth and raised as a goose-girl, by a courtier who places his own daughter in her stead. The king she was engaged to at birth falls in love with her without knowing who she is. The courtier's daughter, Hildegarde, is ignorant of the truth and portrayed sympathetically in the original novel, but the film version restores her role as a villainess, where she is raised by her father and is only presented as the princess when she has come of age. The film is believed to be lost.\nThe plot was reworked into 2002's The Princess and the Pea, combining it with another fairy tale.\nThe Goose Girl, a 1957 West German film by Fritz Genschow.\nThe fairy tale was shown in the 1960s television show Jackanory during Season 1, Episode 38 and was read by Dilys Hamlett.\nIn 1985, Tom Davenport adapted the story into a short film as one of his \"From the Brothers Grimm\" series. While visibly set in the American Appalachia, the narration refers to the characters as princesses, princes, and kings, implying that the story retained its European setting. This version is more faithful to Grimm, as Falada is not restored and the false bride is put to death.\nThe story was adapted by East German studio DEFA for their fairytale movie series in the 1989 film The Goose Princess (Die Geschichte von der G\u00e4nseprinzessin und ihrem treuen Pferd Falada), directed by Konrad Petzold.\nTitled \"The Goose Maiden\" in this version, the tale was loosely adapted into a 1999 German short animated episode with slight differences from the source material. This episode was a part of the series SimsalaGrimm. While Falada is still beheaded, this version has him restored to life. There is no prince, but the king himself is the betrothed. Another change is that the princess has been bewitched into forgetting who she is, rather than being forced into posing as the goose-girl.\nThe story was featured in the anime Manga Sekai Mukashi Banashi. In this version, the evil maid is explicitly a witch's daughter. Similar to SimsalaGrimm, the prince and the king are conflated, and he recognizes the princess after overhearing her talk to Falada's head. In the end, the prince makes a charm with his own blood to defeat the witch.Literature:\n\nThe Goose Girl by Shannon Hale is an adaptation of the tale in the form of a novel.\nBloodleaf, the first of a young adult fantasy trilogy by Crystal Smith, is a gothic retelling of \"The Goose Girl.\" It was published by HMHTeen in 2019.\n\"The Goose Girl\" was one of the many folktales used in  Emma Donoghue's novel Kissing The Witch. The tale was titled \"The Tale of The Handkerchief\".\nAuthor Alethea Kontis adapted this tale together with The Wild Swans in the form of a novel titled Dearest.\nAdrienne Rich's 1974 poem \"The Fact of a Doorframe\" references the Goose Girl.\nThe tale was retold into a short children's book by Eric A. Kimmel.\nIn the sh\u014djo manga Ludwig Revolution (\u30eb\u30fc\u30c9\u30f4\u30a3\u30c3\u30d2\u9769\u547d R\u016bdovihhi Kakumei) the story tells about Prince Ludwig who is ordered by his father to find himself a wife more suitable than the women he often brings into the castle. Along with his servant Wilhelm, they travel across the land in search of fair maidens from classic stories in hopes of finding Ludwig a wife. It includes the tale of \"The Goose Girl\" among other tales from the Brothers Grimm.\n\"Falada: the Goose Girl's Horse\" is a short story adaption by author Nancy Farmer. This version tells the classic tale from Falada's point of view.\nThe Canadian poet Jay Macpherson references the story of the Goose Girl in her poems \"Poor Child\" and \"What Falada Said,\" both reprinted in Poems Twice Told: The Boatman and Welcoming Disaster.\nThe Scottish comic book writer Grant Morrison references the story in Doom Patrol issue 31, \"The Word Made Flesh,\" when Baphomet takes the form of Falada's head.\nIntisar Khanani, author of the Sunbolt Chronicles, wrote a fantasy retelling of the Goose Girl, titled \"Thorn\". The novel was independently published in 2012 and re-published by HarperCollins in 2020.\n\"Feathers of Snow: A Goose Girl Retelling\" by Alice Ivinya is a book based on the fairy tale.\nThough Eudora Welty's novella The Robber Bridegroom is named after and largely follows the plot of a different Brothers Grimm fairy tale, much of the action derives from \"The Goose Girl.\"\n\"Little Thieves\" by Margeret Owen is a YA fantasy novel retelling the story of the Goose Girl from the perspective of the princess' maid. It was published in 2021 by Henry Holt and Co.Other:\n\nAlthough an original story, the German opera K\u00f6nigskinder by Engelbert Humperdinck was inspired by Brothers Grimm fairy tales, particularly \"The Goose Girl.\"\nIn the Doom Patrol comics and live-action series, Baphomet, a magical oracle able to appear in any guise she chooses, in the Unwritten Book storyline, chose to appear in the guise of Falada the magic horse, from The Goose Girl.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The work's status as a novel has been debated, but it is thought by most scholars to be one of the first novels (or a proto-novel) in Urdu.\nSarshar conceived of writing Fasana-e-Azad after the success of the articles he contributed to Avadh Akhbar under the title \"Zarafat\" (\"Wit and Humour\").

With this tune, the hymn has been included in several hymnals, such as Christian Friedrich Witt's Neues Cantional and the Evangelisches Gesangbuch, where it is numbered EG 83. Gerhardt's hymn was however also sung to the tune of \"Herr Gott, erh\u00f6re die Gerechtigkeit\", Zahn No. 7669, and several other melodies were composed for the text: Johannes Zahn lists three 17th-century melodies composed for \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\" (Nos. 7681\u20137683), three from the 18th century (Nos. 7684\u20137686, the first of which was composed for a reworked version of the text), and two from the 19th century (Nos. 7687\u20137688).The third part of a Passion setting presented in Rudolstadt in 1688 opens with Gerhardt's \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\" in the format of an aria, using the \"An Wasserfl\u00fcssen Babylon\" melody. Reinhard Keiser was the first composer who used Gerhardt's hymn in a Passion oratorio in Hamburg: his 1711 setting of Johann Ulrich K\u00f6nig's Thr\u00e4nen unter dem Creutze Jesus libretto opens with it. The second part of Johann Friedrich Fasch's setting of the Brockes Passion libretto, composed around 1717\u20131719, opens with a chorale adaptation of \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\". A Passion oratorio performed in Gotha in 1719 contained an aria based on an excerpt of Gerhardt's hymn.In 1720, Gottfried Heinrich St\u00f6lzel composed a meditation of the stations of the Cross as a Passion oratorio which he titled Die leidende und am Creutz sterbende Liebe Jesu (The love of Jesus which suffered and died on the Cross), which is also known by its incipit, Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld. Composed for Gotha, this oratorio knew many repeat performances, some of these in slightly modified versions: the oratorio was for instance performed in Leipzig in 1734, entitled Der Gl\u00e4ubigen Seele Geistliche Betrachtungen Ihres leidenden Jesu, directed by J. S. Bach, and, in 1736, in Rudolstadt and in N\u00fcrnberg.Three Passions by Georg Philipp Telemann are also known by their incipit Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld: a St Mark Passion of 1723, TWV 5:8, a St John Passion of 1745, TWV 5:30, and a St Matthew Passion of 1766, TWV 5:51. Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld, GWV 1119/24, is a church cantata for the last Sunday before Lent (Estomihi) composed by Christoph Graupner in 1724. Johann Gottfried Walther set \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\" for organ. BWV 267 is Johann Sebastian Bach's chorale harmonisation of Dachstein's hymn tune. Carl Heinrich Graun composed a Passion named after the hymn, Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld, GraunWV B:VII:4, for soloists, choir and orchestra, which has been called Kleine Passion (Little Passion), in comparison to his better-known Der Tod Jesu.Gottfried August Homilius, a Kreuzkantor in Dresden, composed a Passion cantata for soloists, choir and orchestra, HoWV I.2, printed by Breitkopf in 1775. Like his St Matthew Passion, HoWV 1.3, it starts with the words \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\". Chorale preludes on \"Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld\" were composed by Johann Christian Kittel, Gustav Fl\u00fcgel, Carl Steinh\u00e4user and Philipp Wolfrum.

Although Mulga Bill claims expertise in riding all things his ineptitude and subsequent accident suggest that he may only know how to ride a horse.\nThe poem was first published in The Sydney Mail on 25 July 1896 and was illustrated by Norman Hardy who depicts Mulga Bill sat astride the front wheel pedaling with his knees UNDER the handle bars establishing with certainty that he is riding an Ordinary on his perilous ride. It is amongst Paterson's most popular works.  A 1973 reprinting of the poem illustrated by Kilmeny & Deborah Niland has been continuously in print since publication and won the 1973 ABPA Book Design Award and the 1974 Visual Arts Board Award.The novel by H. G. Wells on cycling, The Wheels of Chance: A Bicycling Idyll was published in the same year as this poem.Ordinaries- the term \"Penny-Farthings\" is used interchangeably by many- were notoriously dangerous to ride on level ground, but Banjo has Mulga Bill cycling DOWNHILL on a mountain road at which point he gains so much speed that he becomes the Ordinary's PASSENGER, unable to stop or dismount it. On a standard bicycle one's feet could touch the ground to (inelegantly) brake their speed on a dirt road. But this being an Ordinary, once Mulga Bill sets off downhill with no previous experience riding one, he becomes a victim of his own hubris.  There is no escaping his fate and he narrowly escapes death when his ride concludes with him sailing off of a precipice and crashes into a creek. Pride indeed came before Mulga's fall\nThe model for the character of Mulga Bill was William Henry Lewis (1880-1968), who knew Paterson in the vicinity of Bourke, New South Wales. Lewis had bought his bicycle as a result of a drought when there was no feed for horses.Eaglehawk, Victoria\u2014once a rural mining town, now part of greater Bendigo\u2014was given as Mulga Bill's hometown ('Twas Mulga Bill, from Eaglehawk ...). This has been recognised with the development of the Mulga Bill Bicycle Trail, a scenic ride taking in many of the mining attractions, historic sites and modern-day amenities of Eaglehawk.Mulga is a very common species of Acacia that predominates the interior regions of the Australian bush, and colloquially, it is an alternative term for the Bush itself or wilderness regions,  for example \u2018up the mulga\u2019. This poem is extremely important to Australian culture because it includes the start of the cycling craze.  In the time this poem was written, everyone was buying bicycles because it was (and still partly is) popular in Australia.\nThe poem has been set to music and the poem title was the name of a prominent Australian folk music group (also known as a bush band) in the 1970s.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, around the time of the 20th anniversary of the film in 1996, Cohn revealed that it was actually a work of fiction.\nAfter persuading New York editor Clay Felker to let him write an article about the 1970s disco scene, Cohn, a newcomer to the United States, set about researching the American working-class subculture he was trying to cover. One night he travelled to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, to visit the disco 2001 Odyssey. However when he arrived a drunken fight was taking place outside the club, and one of the participants rolled over in the gutter and threw up on Cohn's trouser leg, leading him to return to Manhattan. Despite this brief visit, Cohn did notice that the scene was surveyed by one clubgoer standing in the doorway and calmly watching events. Cohn returned to the club subsequently but the young man was not there.To overcome his lack of familiarity with the New York disco scene, Cohn combined the image of the figure outside the club with people he knew from his youth, including a gang member from the Northern Ireland city of Derry, where Cohn had grown up, and a young man he knew in England. \"My story was a fraud\", he wrote. \"I'd only recently arrived in New York. Far from being steeped in Brooklyn street life, I hardly knew the place. As for Vincent, my story's hero, he was largely inspired by a Shepherd's Bush mod whom I'd known in the Sixties, a one-time king of Goldhawk Road.\" For additional detail Cohn returned to Bay Ridge during the day to get a better feel for the area.\nOn the 40th anniversary of the article\u2019s publication in 2016, Cohn said that he thought that such a fictionalised piece would not be published in the contemporary press:\nIt reads to me as obvious fiction, albeit based on observation and some knowledge of disco culture. No way could it sneak past customs now. In the 60s and 70s, the line between fact and fiction was blurry... Few editors asked tough questions. For the most part it was a case of \"don't ask, don't tell\".\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}

The son of a Protestant landowner from East Prussia, he studied at the Munich Art Academy with Gabriel von Hackl from 1903. On 15 September 1910 in Frankfurt Franziska married Albert, who was by then employed as a freelancer at Margarete Steiff GmbH, for which he designed catalogs and numerous dolls and stuffed animals. In 1913, Franziska and Albert moved to Munich and settled in the Schwabing district. In May 1915 their daughter Irmgard Erika was born.\nAfter World War I, Franziska Schlopsnies began designing posters for fashion shows, department stores and exhibitions. One of her earliest surviving designs was made in 1920 for the Tietz department store. After the couple's divorce on 18 December 1922 she often signed her designs with the name \"Slopsnies\". From the mid-1920s, she preferred to draw figurines and costumes. Along with Doris Buscher, Liliane and Margaret von Suttner she was considered among the most important fashion illustrators. Her Art Deco-inspired fashion drawings and caricatures were regularly published in magazines, such as Jugend, Simplicissimus, Eleganten Welt, Berliner Illustrirten Zeitung, Sport im Bild and the monthly Velhagen & Klasings Monatshefte.

She learns that it belongs to an artist named Maara (R. Madhavan) who is responsible for the paintings across the village. Maara is a free spirit and traveller who is often away visiting various places and returning as he pleases. When she starts cleaning up the place, she finds Maara's photo and a sketchbook. The sketches depict the previous New Year's Eve when a small-time thief (Alexander Babu) tried to rob Maara. In a turn-of-events, Maara joins the thief, and they both go on the rooftop of a home with a plan to rob the place. There, they see a woman about to shoot herself. The sketchbook ends there, and the story is left unfinished, which piques Paaru's curiosity about the rest of the story, and Maara as a person.\nIntrigued, Paaru starts finding the people in Maara's sketches. Backtracking his steps, she meets an antique dealer, Usman bhai, a \u201cpirate\u201d, Chokku and learns about Selvi (Abhirami), a physically abused woman that Maara had known. Maara and Chokku had taken Selvi out to sea for her birthday where after having an evening that alleviated her sorrows, Selvi committed suicide. Maara then ensures that her daughter, Rani is enrolled into a school. When Paaru gets news that Rani has gone missing from her school, she traces her back to her father's lodge. Meanwhile, Maara, who has returned to the village, tracks Rani down to the lodge and rescues her from her abuser. Paaru gets a glimpse of Maara but just misses an encounter with him.\nOne day, she meets the thief depicted in the sketches and enquires about that day's events. He informs her that Maara stopped the woman from shooting herself, and followed her when she started to run away from him. They find the house and finally identify the woman as Doctor Kani (Sshivada). Paaru then tracks her to a mountain village and enquires about her story. Kani explains that when she performed her first independent operation as a paediatrician, a surgical error led to the death of a 10-year-old girl. Further slandered by the media, she was desperate and about to commit suicide on New Year's Eve when she was by chance, stopped by Maara. Maara then brings her to his mountain village, maintained by Vellaiya (Moulee), his foster father, and she has since been living there. Vellaiya, a retired postmaster and a hopeless romantic, has been searching for his teenage love Meenakshi for nearly fifty years. Vellaiya constantly tells the story of acting out a play to convey his love to Meenakshi, and eventually losing her when a storm flooded his home village.\nWhen Vellaiya shows Paaru a photo of Meenakshi, she notices that she has on the same pendant of a conch as her aunt, Mary, who is a nurse at a convent. She brings her Aunt Mary to the village on Vellaiya's birthday, realising that the plot of his play is the fairy-tale she had heard as a child from Aunt Mary - a story of an immortal soldier who spends years looking for his beloved mystical fish. An emotional Velliya, who has spent all his adult life travelling from place to place in search of Meenakshi, thanks Paaru for fulfilling Velliya's wish. Paaru, who has chased one story after another in an attempt to find Maara, finally meets him in person. They introduce themselves and hold hands as they watch the sun set.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was serialized in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump from October 1981 to November 1983, and the chapters were published in four tank\u014dbon volumes by Shueisha from November 1982 to January 1984. The series was adapted into a 35-episode anime television series by Toei Animation that aired on Fuji Television from May 1983 to January 1984. The story focuses on K\u014dsaku Sakamoto, a high school student who goes to live with yakuza boss Ibari \u014czora and his four children\u2014Tsugumi, Tsubame, Hibari and Suzume\u2014after the death of his mother. K\u014dsaku is shocked to learn that Hibari, who looks and behaves as a girl, was assigned male at birth.\nEguchi wanted to create a romantic comedy manga where the main female character is a cross-dressing boy so as to poke fun at the genre. He took more time to draw the chapters compared to his earlier manga, and as the serialization continued, he found it increasingly difficult to keep up a weekly pace for the chapters. He eventually abandoned the series after the editor-in-chief of Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump refused his request to release the chapters every other week. From July 2009 to February 2010, Shogakukan published a three-volume Stop!! Hibari-kun! Complete Edition omnibus collection, which features various revisions to the originally published chapters in addition to newly drawn cover art.\nStop!! Hibari-kun! has been described as achieving a dizzying reality with Hibari by contrasting a girlish exterior with a male interior. The series has been praised for its overall light and pop literary style, and the delicate touch in how Hibari is drawn has been described as so attractive that it makes the reader forget that it is a gag manga. However, the jokes surrounding the yakuza characters have been criticized as extreme and no longer humorous in modern times. The series has also been described as having had a hand in paving the way for the J-pop phenomenon.", "hasanswer": true}]}

It tells the story of Nausica\u00e4, a princess of a small kingdom on a post-apocalyptic Earth with a toxic ecosystem, who becomes involved in a war between kingdoms while an environmental disaster threatens humankind.\nPrior to creating Nausica\u00e4, Miyazaki had worked as an animator for Toei Animation, Nippon Animation and Tokyo Movie Shinsha (TMS), the latter for whom he had directed his feature directorial debut, Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro (1979). After working on an aborted film adaptation of Richard Corben's comic book Rowlf for TMS, he agreed to create a manga series for Tokuma Shoten's monthly magazine Animage, initially on the condition that it would not be adapted into a film. The development of Nausica\u00e4 was influenced by the Japanese Heian period tale The Lady who Loved Insects, a similarly-named character from Homer's epic poem Odyssey and the Minamata Bay mercury pollution. The setting and visual style of the manga was influenced by M\u0153bius. It was serialized intermittently in Animage from February 1982 to March 1994 and the individual chapters were collected and published by Tokuma Shoten in seven tank\u014dbon volumes. It was serialized with an English translation in North America by Viz Media from 1988 to 1996 as a series of 27 comic book issues and has been published in collected form multiple times.\nSince its initial serialization, Nausica\u00e4 has become a commercial success, particularly in Japan, where the series has more than 17 million copies in circulation. The manga and the 1984 film adaptation, written and directed by Miyazaki and released following the serialization of the manga's first sixteen chapters, received universal acclaim from critics and scholars for its characters, themes, and art. The manga and film versions of Nausica\u00e4 are also credited for the foundation of Studio Ghibli, the animation studio for which Miyazaki created several of his most recognized works.", "hasanswer": true}]}

He contemplated this, since he had to design a long-running series instead of the autoconclusive short stories that he had been developing until that point. He accepted, and the series became Nagai's first big success when Sh\u014dnen Jump sold more than one million copies. With Harenchi Gakuen, Nagai became the originator of ecchi manga, opened the door for a series of taboo-shattering gag comics, and also became the symbol of an entire generation. This work has influenced the world of manga, effecting both social mores and what was considered appropriate for manga.Harenchi Gakuen started with the idea of making a manga around a school. Nagai liked the word \"Harenchi\" (scandal), which was used commonly to advertise adult movies. For him, scandal and school were like oil and water, and he thought that mixing them would be funny. At first, Nagai did not have an idea of what stories to develop, but his assistant at the time was boasting about how he had peeped on the girls during their physical examinations from a hole in the roof of his school; this idea was developed into the plot of the manga. Originally, open erotic references did not appear in Harenchi Gakuen. The first physical examination scenes only showed from the shoulders up, but there were a lot of girls drawn, and their images became popular. The editor asked Nagai to go further, which Nagai was eager to do.The inspiration for Harenchi Gakuen came from the West. Nagai liked foreign movies and used to read Playboy magazine and other erotic magazines when he was a child. For the depiction of breasts, he took particular inspiration from the Venus de Milo. According to Nagai, what he in fact drew was not about eroticism per se, but about Japan's culture of shame. He wanted embarrassment to be the eroticism of the stories.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The article was influential in the debate concerning the causes of British imperial expansion in the 19th-century which, since John A. Hobson's Imperialism: A Study (1902), had focused on economic motivation. Instead, Gallagher and Robinson claimed that the New Imperialism \u2013 \"the new spate of imperial expansion that gathered momentum from the 1880s\" \u2013 could be best characterised as a continuation of a longer-term policy begun in the 1850s in which informal empire, based on the principles of free trade, was favoured over formal imperial control unless circumstances made such rule impossible. As well as reigniting scholarly interest in theorizing New Imperialism, the article helped launch the Cambridge School of historiography.\nThe arguments proposed in the article were later developed in a full-length book, Africa and the Victorians (1961), in conjunction with Alice Denny. The book put forward a subtly different explanation for European expansion in Africa, built around geopolitics and a strategy of protecting British India from encroachment by other European powers. The strategic model and its relevance to East Africa was criticised for its limited documentary basis and sequential inconsistencies by John Darwin in 1997, a refutation that was further consolidated and contextualised by Jonas Gjers\u00f8 in 2015.Reviewing the debate from the end of the 20th century, historian  Martin Lynn argues that Gallagher and Robinson exaggerated its impact. He says that Britain achieved its goal of increasing its economic interests in many areas, \"but the broader goal of 'regenerating' societies and thereby creating regions tied as 'tributaries' to British economic interests was not attained.\" The reasons were:\n\nthe aim to reshape the world through free trade and its extension overseas owed more to the misplaced optimism of British policy-makers and their partial views of the world than to an understanding of the realities of the mid-19th century globe.... the volumes of trade and investment...the British were able to generate remained limited....Local economies and local regimes proved adept at restricting the reach of British trade and investment.  Local impediments to foreign inroads, the inhabitants' low purchasing power, the resilience of local manufacturing, and the capabilities of local entrepreneurs meant that these areas effectively resisted British economic penetration.\nThe idea that free-trade imperial states use informal methods to secure their expanding economic influence has attracted Marxist historiographers to use the theory to describe how the modern economic policies of the United States and the imperialist policies of Great Britain are essentially the same, in both motive and method.", "hasanswer": true}]}
{"id": "1433_95", "question": "What larger work was Yu Yu Hakusho published in?", "ctxs": [{"id": "1433_69373", "text": "Author Yoshihiro Togashi stated that he began working on YuYu Hakusho during a period of time around November 1990, though he forgot the exact time. He had recently completed the serialization of his romantic comedy Ten de Sh\u014dwaru Cupid in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump. Having felt somewhat intimidated by some of his more popular fellow authors during this manga's run, Togashi realized he would need to create a fighting manga to both gain popularity and write something he enjoyed. As a fan of the occult and horror films, he desired to write and illustrate a new manga based on his interests. Togashi had previously published an occult detective fiction manga titled Occult Tanteidan, of which he referenced positive reception from readers as a reason for continuing to create manga. When first producing YuYu Hakusho, he did not have a clear idea of what he wanted to call it. He used the tentative title \"How to be a Ghost\" while presenting rough drafts to his editors. Once given the go-ahead to begin publication, Togashi proposed \"YuYu-Ki\" (Poltergeist Chronicles) for the title, as there would be battles with demons and it would be a play on the title SaiYu-Ki. However, a series with a similar name (Chin-Yu-Ki) had already begun publication, so Togashi quickly created an alternative: \"YuYu Hakusho\" (Poltergeist Report). He commented that he could have used \"Den\" (Legend) or \"Monogatari\" (Story), but \"Hakusho\" (Report) was the first thing that came to his mind. He contiguously developed the names of the main characters by skimming through a dictionary and taking out kanji characters he found appealing. \"Yusuke Urameshi\" is a pun, \"Kazuma Kuwabara\" is a combination of two professional baseball players, and \"Hiei\" and \"Kurama\" are \"just names that popped into [Togashi's] head.\" When he introduced the latter two characters in volume three, the author had early plans to make Kurama a main character but was not certain about Hiei.The manga's shift from occult detective fiction to the martial arts genre after Yusuke's death and revival in the early chapters was planned by Togashi from the beginning. He took this idea from the series Kinnikuman, which began largely as a comedy before concentrating more on action. Togashi's intention was to establish the main characters and familiarize the reader with them before placing them in tense, physical conflicts. His editor at the time was nervous of him beginning the manga this way and recommended he transition to a battle-focused plot after about 30 chapters. YuYu Hakusho borrows many elements from Asian folklore, particularly Buddhist beliefs in the afterlife. Togashi came up with the concept of the Ningenkai (Human World), Reikai (Underworld), and Makai (Demon Plane) as being parallel planes of existence in the manga's universe. He thought of them as places that one could not easily travel between using modern technology, but rather as a spirit lacking a material body. However, the idea for the \"territory\" powers from the Sensui story arc was parodied from a separate, unnamed work by Yasutaka Tsutsui. For his drawing materials, Togashi used drafting ink and Kabura pens throughout the creation of the series. While his style of artwork began with screentone, he gradually developed into minimalism. As the series progressed, he would draw figures and faces very detailed or \"cartoony, sketchy and jumping with action\" whenever he desired such effects.During the years he worked on YuYu Hakusho, Togashi would calculate the personal time he had based on a formula of four hours per page without scripting and five hours of sleep per night. He wrote in his own d\u014djinshi Yoshirin de Pon! that he stopped the production on YuYu Hakusho out of selfishness. The author had originally wanted to end the manga in December 1993, at the climax of the Sensui arc. Although there was not a large demand from the editorial staff, Togashi was under a great deal of personal stress at certain points of the series' run, particularly during its final six months of publication. He claimed that, beginning with the Dark Tournament arc, inconsistent sleep resulting from overwork was causing him health problems. He noted himself as being very ill while working on the color pages for Yusuke's match with Chu. There were also many instances where he would create nearly entire manuscripts by himself, such as Yusuke's meeting with Raizen and the battle between Kurama and Karasu. The editors of the publication tried to make Togashi reconsider cancelling Yu Yu Hakusho, though he justified his decision by stating that it would simply be replaced by another popular series. Togashi was relieved at the conclusion of the manga. The author claimed to not have been involved in the production of the YuYu Hakusho anime adaptation due to his own work schedule. He stated that he was greatly impressed by Shigeru Chiba's voice depiction of Kuwabara, admitting that the voice actor understood the character better than Togashi himself.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Upon its issuance, the LDS Church in conference accepted Woodruff's Manifesto as \"authoritative and binding.\"\nThe Manifesto was a dramatic turning point in the history of the LDS Church. It advised church members against entering into any marriage prohibited by the law of the land, and made it possible for Utah to become a U.S. state.

Though neither Manifesto dissolved existing plural marriages, plural marriage in the LDS Church gradually died by attrition during the early-to-mid 20th century. The Manifesto was canonized in the LDS Church standard works as Official  Declaration 1 and is considered by mainstream Mormons to have been prompted by divine revelation (although not a revelation itself), in which Woodruff was shown that the church would be thrown into turmoil if they did not comply with it.

Prisoners of the Sun was the twelfth story to be adapted and was divided into two thirty-minute episodes. Directed by St\u00e9phane Bernasconi, the series has been praised for being \"generally faithful\" to the original comics, to the extent that the animation was directly adopted from Herg\u00e9's original panels.In 1997, the French company Infogrames released a video game based on The Seven Crystal Balls-Prisoners of the Sun story arc, titled Prisoners of the Sun.In 2001, The Seven Crystal Balls and Prisoners of the Sun were adapted into a theatrical musical, Kuifje \u2013 De Zonnetempel (Tintin \u2013 The Temple of the Sun), which premiered in Dutch at the Stadsschouwburg in Antwerp, Belgium, on 15 September.

M. E. McTaggart (1866\u20131925). In the argument, first published as a journal article in Mind in 1908, McTaggart argues that time is unreal because our descriptions of time are either contradictory, circular, or insufficient. A slightly different version of the argument appeared in 1927 as one of the chapters in the second volume of McTaggart's greatest work, The Nature of Existence.The argument for the unreality of time is popularly treated as a stand-alone argument that does not depend on any significant metaphysical principles (e.g. as argued by C. D. Broad 1933 and L. O. Mink 1960). R. D. Ingthorsson disputes this, and argues that the argument can only be understood as an attempt to draw out certain consequences of the metaphysical system that McTaggart presents in the first volume of The Nature of Existence (Ingthorsson 1998 & 2016).\nIt is helpful to consider the argument as consisting of three parts. In the first part, McTaggart offers a phenomenological analysis of the appearance of time, in terms of the now famous A- and B-series (see below for detail). In the second part, he argues that a conception of time as only forming a B-series but not an A-series is an inadequate conception of time because the B-series does not contain any notion of change. The A-series, on the other hand, appears to contain change and is thus more likely to be an adequate conception of time. In the third and final part, he argues that the conception of time forming an A-series is contradictory and thus nothing can be like an A-series. Since the A- and the B- series exhaust possible conceptions of how reality can be temporal, and neither is adequate, the conclusion McTaggart reaches is that reality is not temporal at all.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Kennan and published under the pseudonym \"X\" in the July 1947 issue of Foreign Affairs magazine. It widely introduced the term \"containment\" and advocated for its strategic use against the Soviet Union. It expanded on ideas expressed by Kennan in a confidential February 1946 telegram, formally identified by Kennan's State Department number, \"511\", but informally dubbed the \"long telegram\" for its size.\nKennan composed the long telegram to respond to inquiries about the implications of a February 1946 speech by Joseph Stalin. Though the speech was in line with previous statements by Stalin, it provoked fear in the American press and public; Time magazine called it \"the most warlike pronouncement uttered by any top-rank statesman since V-J Day\". The long telegram explained Soviet motivations by recounting the history of Russian rulers as well as the ideology of Marxism\u2013Leninism. It argued that the Soviet leaders used the ideology to characterize the external world as hostile, allowing them to justify their continued hold on power despite a lack of popular support. Washington bureaucrats quickly read the confidential message and accepted it as the best explanation of Soviet behavior. The reception elevated Kennan's reputation within the State Department as one of the government's foremost Soviet experts.\nAfter hearing Kennan speak about Soviet foreign relations at the Council on Foreign Relations in January 1947, international banker R. Gordon Wasson suggested that he share his views in an article for Foreign Affairs. Kennan revised a piece he had submitted to Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal in late-January 1947, but his role in government precluded him from publishing under his name. His superiors granted him approval to publish the piece provided it was released anonymously; Foreign Affairs attributed the article only to \"X\". Expressing similar sentiments to that of the long telegram, the piece was strong in its anti-communism, introducing and outlining a basic theory of containment.  The article was widely read; though it does not mention the Truman Doctrine, having mostly been written before Truman's speech, it quickly became seen as an expression of the doctrine's policy. Retrospective commentators dispute the impact of the article; Henry Kissinger referred to it as \"the diplomatic doctrine of the era\", while some historians write that its impact in shaping governmental policy has been overstated.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The series resumed publication on October 24, 2022, after a three-year-and-eleven-month hiatus. On December 26, 2022, it was announced that the manga would enter on hiatus. The Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump editorial department published a letter which said that they had consulted with Togashi and decided that the manga should not follow a weekly serialized format going forward, and that once they know concrete details of its return and how it will be serialized, they will reveal the details in the magazine. On March 9, 2023, Togashi tweeted that chapter 401 had been completed, but the form of publication has not been decided at the time. On October 1 of the same year, Togashi made his first tweet in nearly seven months, which contained the phrase \"Start over\" in English, as well as an image depicting the bottom right corner of a page with a ruler below.In November 2023, on TV Asahi's variety show Iwakura and Yoshizumi Show, Togashi announced that he had planned four possible scenarios for the series' finale through a handwritten letter which was read aloud during the program. Only the fourth abandoned ending (\"ending D\") was revealed, stating that it could be considered the ending in case he dies before finishing the manga. This ending takes place after a time skip, years into the future, featuring Gon's granddaughter, Gin. Togashi expressed a desire to create a satisfying enough conclusion so he would not have to resort to endings A, B, or C. Togashi stated that the readers' reactions would be 80% positive on ending A, even split on ending B, and 90% negative on ending C. While acknowledging ending A as a \"safe\", noncontroversial option, Togashi personally preferred ending C, despite expecting significant criticism from fans.", "hasanswer": false}]}

As critic Charles Affron puts it: \"The creator of a universe so tied up with inner rhythms and resounding with so many echoes does not hesitate to imply that the germs of a character's failure can be found in the physical qualities of his name.\" This idea came to Balzac from Laurence Sterne, as he acknowledged in his 1841 story Ursule Mirou\u00ebt: \"[N]e doit-on pas reconna\u00eetre avec Sterne l'occulte puissance des noms, qui tant\u00f4t raillent et tant\u00f4t pr\u00e9disent les caract\u00e8res?\" (\"Should we not agree with Sterne in recognizing the occult power in names, which sometimes mock and sometimes define the characters of their possessors?\")Z.

Reinhart and Rogoff (RR) did not publish the data sample upon which they based their conclusions, but they made it available upon request to Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash and Robert Pollin (HAP), who then closely examined the data used in the study.\nIn April 2013, HAP released a critique of the RR data analysis in the working paper \"Does High Public Debt Consistently Stifle Economic Growth? A Critique of Reinhart and Rogoff\", later published in the Cambridge Journal of Economics. They contend that the statistical analyses performed on the data in the original RR Excel spreadsheet (which were used to support the conclusions of the paper) were flawed: \"While using RR's working spreadsheet, we identified coding errors, selective exclusion of available data, and unconventional weighting of summary statistics.\" Using RR's working spreadsheet, but correcting for the claimed errors, HAP found:When properly calculated, the average real GDP growth rate for countries carrying a public-debt-to-GDP ratio of over 90 percent is actually 2.2 percent, not \u22120.1 percent as published in Reinhart and Rogoff. That is, contrary to RR, average GDP growth at public debt/GDP ratios over 90 percent is not dramatically different than when debt/GDP ratios are lower.\nHAP also argued that the sample was biased, claiming that RR selectively omitted data for Australia, Canada, and New Zealand for the early post-World War II period, which showed high growth despite large public debts, while including data for the United States for the same period that showed negative GDP growth, which Herndon attributed to demobilization of U.S. military personnel. Also, by using only one year's data for New Zealand, a negative 7.6% GDP growth in 1951, a year in which New Zealand's trade suffered from a major strike, the average central tendency of the available 5 years (1946\u20131949 and 1951) shifted from 2.6% to \u22127.6%.HAP concluded that the \"combination of the collapse of the empirical result that high public debt is inevitably associated with greatly reduced GDP growth and the weakness of the theoretical mechanism under current conditions... render the Reinhart and Rogoff point close to irrelevant for current public policy debate.\"RR published a lengthy, detailed response to HAP in The New York Times:\nHerndon, Ash and Pollin accurately point out the coding error that omits several countries from the averages in figure 2. Full stop. HAP are on point.... HAP go on to note some other missing debt data points [New Zealand], which they describe as \"selective omissions.\" This charge, which permeates through their paper, is one we object to in the strongest terms.... Data for New Zealand for the years around WWII had just been incorporated and we had not vetted the comparability and quality data with data for the more recent period.... They argue that we use an \"unconventional weighting of summary statistics.\" In particular, for each bucket, we take average growth rates for each country and then take an average of the result. This seems perfectly natural to us, and hardly unconventional.\nEconomics professor L. Randall Wray criticized Reinhart and Rogoff for combining data \"across centuries, exchange rate regimes, public and private debt, and debt denominated in foreign currency as well as domestic currency,\" in addition to \"statistical errors,\" and for lacking a \"theory of sovereign currency\".Other critiques point out that any correspondence between debt levels and insufficient economic growth could just as easily be reversed: it is the weak economic growth that leads to the high debt levels. Others have argued that the relationship between debt and growth varies significantly between countries, meaning that an average \"rule\", such as that suggested by Reinhart and Rogoff, has little meaning or policy relevance.Economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote in 2013:\nWhat the Reinhart-Rogoff affair shows is the extent to which austerity has been sold on false pretenses. For three years, the turn to austerity has been presented not as a choice but as a necessity. Economic research, austerity advocates insisted, showed that terrible things happen once debt exceeds 90 percent of G.D.P. But \"economic research\" showed no such thing; a couple of economists made that assertion, while many others disagreed.

This results from the fractal curve\u2013like properties of coastlines; i.e., the fact that a coastline typically has a fractal dimension.   Although the \"paradox of length\" was previously noted by Hugo Steinhaus, the first systematic study of this phenomenon was by Lewis Fry Richardson, and it was expanded upon by Benoit Mandelbrot.The measured length of the coastline depends on the method used to measure it and the degree of cartographic generalization. Since a landmass has features at all scales, from hundreds of kilometers in size to tiny fractions of a millimeter and below, there is no obvious size of the smallest feature that should be taken into consideration when measuring, and hence no single well-defined perimeter to the landmass. Various approximations exist when specific assumptions are made about minimum feature size.\nThe problem is fundamentally different from the measurement of other, simpler edges. It is possible, for example, to accurately measure the length of a straight, idealized metal bar by using a measurement device to determine that the length is less than a certain amount and greater than another amount\u2014that is, to measure it within a certain degree of uncertainty. The more precise the measurement device, the closer results will be to the true length of the edge. When measuring a coastline, however, the closer measurement does not result in an increase in accuracy\u2014the measurement only increases in length; unlike with the metal bar, there is no way to obtain an exact value for the length of the coastline.\nIn three-dimensional space, the coastline paradox is readily extended to the concept of fractal surfaces, whereby the area of a surface varies depending on the measurement resolution.", "hasanswer": true}]}

A compilation of these 77 essays and eight others were published in two volumes as The Federalist: A Collection of Essays, Written in Favour of the New Constitution, as Agreed upon by the Federal Convention, September 17, 1787, by publishing firm J. & A.

This is complemented by Federalist No. 14, in which Madison takes the measure of the United States, declares it appropriate for an extended republic, and concludes with a memorable defense of the constitutional and political creativity of the Federal Convention.In Federalist No. 84, Hamilton makes the case that there is no need to amend the Constitution by adding a Bill of Rights, insisting that the various provisions in the proposed Constitution protecting liberty amount to a \"bill of rights.\" Federalist No. 78, also written by Hamilton, lays the groundwork for the doctrine of judicial review by federal courts of federal legislation or executive acts. Federalist No. 70 presents Hamilton's case for a one-man chief executive. In Federalist No. 39, Madison presents the clearest exposition of what has come to be called \"Federalism\".

In 1817, Shelley began writing the poem \"Ozymandias\", after the British Museum acquired the Younger Memnon, a head-and-torso fragment of a statue of Ramesses II, which dated from the 13th century BC. Earlier, in 1816, the Italian archeologist Giovanni Battista Belzoni had removed the 7.25-short-ton (6.58 t; 6,580 kg) statue fragment from the Ramesseum, the mortuary temple of Ramesses II at Thebes, Egypt. The reputation of the statue fragment preceded its arrival to Western Europe; after his Egyptian expedition in 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte had failed to acquire the Younger Memnon for France. Although the British Museum expected delivery of the antiquity in 1818, the Younger Memnon did not arrive in London until 1821.\nShelley published his poems before the statue fragment of Ozymandias arrived in Britain, and the view of modern scholarship is that Shelley never saw the statue, although he might have learned about it from news reports, as it was well known even in its previous location near Luxor.The book Les Ruines, ou m\u00e9ditations sur les r\u00e9volutions des empires (1791) by Constantin Fran\u00e7ois de Chasseb\u0153uf, comte de Volney (1757\u20131820), first published in an English translation as The Ruins, or a Survey of the Revolutions of Empires (London: Joseph Johnson, 1792) by James Marshall, was an influence on Shelley.

One such treatment considers the poem to be allegory, in which interpretation the lamenting speaker represents the Church as Bride of Christ or as an otherwise feminine allegorical figure. Another dissenting interpretation holds that the speaker, who describes herself held within an old earth cell (eald is \u00fees eor\u00f0sele) beneath an oak tree (under actreo), may indeed literally be located in a cell under the earth, and would therefore constitute a voice of the deceased, speaking from beyond the grave. Both the interpretations, as with most alternatives, face difficulties, particularly in the latter case, for which no analogous texts exist in the Old English corpus.\nThe status of the poem as a lament spoken by a female protagonist is therefore fairly well established in criticism. Interpretations that attempt a treatment diverging from this, though diverse in their approach, bear a fairly heavy burden of proof. Thematic consistencies between the Wife's Lament and its close relative in the genre of the woman's song, as well as close neighbour in the Exeter Book, Wulf and Eadwacer, make unconventional treatments somewhat counterintuitive. A final point of divergence, however, between the conventional interpretation and variants proceeds from the similarity of the poem in some respects to elegiac poems in the Old English corpus that feature male protagonists. Similarities between the language and circumstances of the male protagonist of The Wanderer, for example, and the protagonist of the Wife's Lament have led other critics to argue, even more radically, that the protagonist of the poem (to which the attribution of the title \"the wife's lament\" is wholly apocryphal and fairly recent) may in fact be male. This interpretation, however, faces the almost insurmountable problem that adjectives and personal nouns occurring within the poem (geomorre, minre, sylfre) are feminine in grammatical gender. This interpretation is at the very least dependent therefore on a contention that perhaps a later Anglo-Saxon copyist has wrongly imposed feminine gender on the protagonist where this was not the original authorial intent, and such contentions almost wholly relegate discussion to the realm of the hypothetical. It is also thought by some that The Wife's Lament and The Husband's Message may be part of a larger work.The poem is also considered by some to be a riddle poem.  A riddle poem contains a lesson told in cultural context which would be understandable or relates to the reader, and was a very popular genre of poetry of the time period.  Gnomic wisdom is also a characteristic of a riddle poem, and is present in the poem's closing sentiment (lines 52-53). Also, it cannot be ignored that contained within the Exeter Book are 92 other riddle poems.  According to Faye Walker-Pelkey, \"The Lament's placement in the Exeter Book, its mysterious content, its fragmented structure, its similarities to riddles, and its inclusion of gnomic wisdom suggest that the \"elegy\"...is a riddle.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

The painting depicts the mythological Minotaur as a solitary and seemingly lonely creature, leaning on a parapet and staring longingly at the sea while gripping a crushed bird in his hand.Borges's composition of \"The House of Asterion\" and other short stories in The Aleph coincided with his turbulent relationship with Argentine writer Estela Canto. Borges first met Canto in 1944 and proposed to her only a year later; but their relationship ended in July 1946 after Canto came to resent Borges's mother, whom she found to be overly controlling of him. Edwin Williamson, one of Borges's biographers, wrote that Canto's desertion of Borges and his subsequent unhappiness influenced elements of  \"The House of Asterion\", including the title character's extreme loneliness and desire to be liberated from his monotonous existence.\nAccording to Norman Thomas di Giovanni, an editor and translator who frequently collaborated with Borges, \"The House of Asterion\" was written over a period of two days in 1947, after Borges discovered that he had two blank pages to fill in Los Anales de Buenos Aires, the literary magazine he edited. Modern analyses of Borges's original handwritten manuscript, which is kept at the University of Virginia, have revealed the revisions he made to earlier drafts of the work in order to more effectively disguise the narrator's identity in the story's beginning. For instance, Borges replaced the phrase \"los griegos\" (the Greeks) with \"los hombres\" (the men) in the third sentence, removing a potential intimation of Greek mythology. Analyses of Borges's revisions have also suggested that, while writing the story, he experimented with various framings of the reveal of Asterion's identity, deliberating on whether to explicitly name the Minotaur's labyrinth and to mention the nature of Theseus's weapon.The original Spanish-language version of \"The House of Asterion\" was published in print in the May\u2013June 1947 edition of Los Anales de Buenos Aires. It was accompanied by an illustration, by Austrian artist Marie Elisabeth Wrede, depicting Asterion slumped on the ground with his head covered by a shroud, as Theseus stands over him, sword in hand. The story would later be included, alongside twelve other short stories by Borges, in The Aleph, first published by Editorial Losada in June 1949.

Stephen Schwartz, the composer behind the Broadway theater hits Godspell (1971), Pippin (1972), and The Magic Show (1974), received a call from the company asking if he would like to collaborate with Menken. Schwartz had never considered working in the film industry, but agreed to do so nonetheless. Schwartz did not feel he was well-suited to the job.Schwartz wanted to write a song for the film wherein Pocahontas confronts the Eurocentrism of John Smith. \"Colors of the Wind\" was the first song written for Pocahontas. According to Schwartz, the song \"influence[d] the development of the rest of the film.\" Schwartz said that \"a story-board outline was in place before we wrote [the track]. This is often the process in animation, at least as I've experienced it, where everybody works from an outline and each succeeding piece of material, whether it is a song or drawings, influences the next.\" The track was inspired by Native American poetry, music and folklore, as well as a now-debunked  letter that Schwartz believed was sent to the United States Congress by Chief Seattle regarding humanity's relationship with nature but was in fact a fabrication. Part of the letter reads: \"The wind that gave our grandfather his first breath also received his last sigh. The wind also gives our children the spirit of life. So if we sell our land, you must keep it apart and sacred, as a place where man can go to taste the wind that is sweetened by the meadow flowers.\" This portion of the letter inspired the song's title, which Schwartz liked because he saw it as paradoxical and thought-provoking.Schwartz also drew inspiration for \"Colors of the Wind\" from the music of Oscar Hammerstein II and Sheldon Harnick, as it deals with issues of prejudice. Menken said that while \"Colors of the Wind\" was \"born out of the modality of Native American music...it quickly moved to its own place, which is hard to define.\" Menken has noted that the song lacks humor, which he and Schwartz attempted to inject into Pocahontas and failed. Initially, the final lines of the song were \"For your life's an empty hull/till you get it through your skull/you can paint with all the colors of the wind.\" Menken disapproved of these lyrics and asked Schwartz to rewrite them; Schwartz changed the lines to \"You can own the Earth, and still/all you'll own is earth until/you can paint with all the colors of the wind.\" Schwartz preferred the altered lyrics. Schwartz said that this incident taught him the lesson: \"If your collaborator is unhappy, it's probably because [the song] needs to be better,\" adding that he may not have won an Academy Award if he did not change the lyrics. Menken views \"Colors of the Wind\" as one of the most important songs he has written. Schwartz believed that the Walt Disney Company would reject \"Colors of the Wind\" for being philosophical and different from previous Disney songs. Judy Kuhn sang the song to help \"pitch\" Schwartz's score to Disney, and the studio embraced the track. Schwartz and Menken became friends, and later wrote music for the Disney films The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) and Enchanted (2007) together.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was first published in the literary journal The Russian Messenger in twelve monthly installments during 1866. It was later published in a single volume. It is the second of Dostoevsky's full-length novels following his return from ten years of exile in Siberia. Crime and Punishment is considered the first great novel of his mature period of writing and is often cited as one of the greatest works of world literature.Crime and Punishment follows the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in Saint Petersburg who plans to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker, an old woman who stores money and valuable objects in her flat. He theorises that with the money he could liberate himself from poverty and go on to perform great deeds, and seeks to convince himself that certain crimes are justifiable if they are committed in order to remove obstacles to the higher goals of 'extraordinary' men. Once the deed is done, however, he finds himself wracked with confusion, paranoia, and disgust. His theoretical justifications lose all their power as he struggles with guilt and horror and is confronted with both internal and external consequences of his deed.", "hasanswer": true}]}
