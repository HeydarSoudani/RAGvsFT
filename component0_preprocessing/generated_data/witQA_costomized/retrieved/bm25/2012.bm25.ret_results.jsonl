Padang food is famous for its rich taste of succulent coconut milk and spicy chili. Minang cuisine put much emphasis in three elements; gulai (curry), lado (chili pepper) and bareh (rice). No traditional Padang meal is complete without the three\u2014spicy chili sauce, thick curry, and perfect steamed rice. Among the cooking traditions in Indonesian cuisine, Minangkabau cuisine and most of Sumatran cuisine, demonstrate Indian and Middle Eastern influences, with dishes cooked in curry sauce with coconut milk and the heavy use of spices mixture.\nBecause most Minangkabau people are Muslims, Minangkabau cuisine follows halal dietary law rigorously. Protein intake are mostly taken from beef, water buffalo, goat, lamb meat, and poultry and fish. Minangkabau people are known for their fondness of cattle meat products including offal. Almost all the parts of a cattle, such as meat, ribs, tongue, tail, liver, tripe, brain, bone marrow, spleen, intestine, cartilage, tendon, and skin are made to be Minangkabau delicacies. Seafood is popular in coastal West Sumatran cities, and most are grilled or fried with spicy chili sauce or in curry gravy. Fish, shrimp, and cuttlefish are cooked in similar fashion. Most of Minangkabau food is eaten with hot steamed rice or compressed rice such as katupek (ketupat). Vegetables are mostly boiled such as boiled cassava leaf, or simmered in thin curry as side dishes, such as gulai of young jackfruit or cabbages.\nIn Padang food establishments, it is common to eat with one's hands. They usually provide kobokan, a bowl of tap water with a slice of lime in it to give a fresh scent. This water is used to wash one's hands before and after eating. If a customer does not wish to eat with bare hands, it is acceptable to ask for a spoon and fork.\n\nThe cuisine is usually cooked once per day. To have Nasi Padang in restaurants customers choose from those dishes, which are left on display in high-stacked plates in the windows. During a dine-in hidang (serve) style Padang restaurant, after the customers are seated, they do not have to order. The waiter immediately serves the dishes directly to the table, and the table will quickly be set with dozens of small dishes filled with highly flavored foods such as beef rendang, curried fish, stewed greens, chili eggplant, curried beef liver, tripe, intestines, or foot tendons, fried beef lung, fried chicken, and of course, sambal, the spicy sauces ubiquitous at Indonesian tables. Customers take\u2014and pay for\u2014only what they want from this array. The best known Padang dish is rendang, a spicy meat stew. Soto Padang (crispy beef in spicy soup) is local residents' breakfast favorite, meanwhile sate (beef satay in curry sauce served with ketupat) is a treat in the evening.\nThe serving style is different in Nasi Kapau food stalls, a Minangkabau Bukittinggi style. After the customer is seated, he or she is asked which dishes they desire. The chosen dishes will be put directly upon the steamed rice or in separate small plates.\nThere are myriad Padang food establishments throughout Indonesia and the region, according to Ikatan Warung Padang Indonesia (Iwapin) or Warung Padang Bonds. In greater Jakarta alone there are at least 20,000 Padang restaurant establishments. Several notable Minangkabau restaurant chains are Sederhana, Garuda, Pagi Sore, Simpang Raya, Sari Ratu, Sari Minang, Salero Bagindo and Natrabu.\nThe importance of Padang food establishments (warung or rumah makan Padang) for Indonesian workers' lunch break in urban areas, was demonstrated in 2016; when Jakarta municipal civil servants demanded the raise of uang lauk pauk (food allowance, as a component of civil servant's salary), following the raise of Nasi Padang price in Greater Jakarta area.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Originally, finely chopped pre-cooked meat was used as a filling, but later raw ground meat became more common. Alternatively, peremech can be filled with potato or quark.Peremech is usually shaped into a flattened sphere with a circular \"window\" in the middle. In contrast to doughnuts, the hole does not go all the way through, but is only made at the top, such that the filling is visible in the middle. The shape is thus somewhat similar to Russian vatrushka. However, dough neatly kneaded around the hole gives the classical peremech its distinctive shape.Peremech is traditionally served with broth, qatiq (yogurt) or ayran.Nowadays, the meat-filled version is popular throughout Russia and other post-Soviet countries where it is usually referred to as belyash (Russian: \u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0448, pl. \u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0448\u0438, belyashi).

They ask the rhetorical question, \"can this two-room joint with the blaring jukebox really be the most famous Creole roadhouse in America?\"; then they describe the experience as a \"culinary epiphany\", and say that \"roadside food gets no better, or more garlicky, or heartier, than this.\"Calvin Trillin, in a November 2010 article about the restaurant in The New Yorker, also remarks on its seemingly unchanged nature since 1946. He recounts that the Mosca family had once considered moving the restaurant to a more convenient location, but the idea had met substantial resistance from their mostly local customer base.Reviews of the restaurant often note that almost every party orders more or less the same items from Mosca's relatively short menu, served family-style in very large portions.  These popular dishes include:\n\nOysters Mosca (also called Oysters Italian Style), which the Sterns call \"a festival of garlic, olive oil, Parmesan cheese, and bread crumbs\").\nShrimp Mosca (also called Shrimp Italian Style), summarized by local food critic Tom Fitzmorris as \"enormous, whole, unpeeled, with olive oil and tons of garlic\".\nMarinated crab, served as a salad or in the shell.\nChicken a la Grande, a simple dish cooked in a skillet with (in Trillin's words) \"only salt and pepper, rosemary, oregano, white wine, and, of course, ten cloves (or is it heads?) of garlic\".\nSpaghetti bordelaise, described by the Collins as \"perfect homemade pasta and a remarkable, perfectly balanced oil and garlic sauce\", and which Roahen calls \"as much butter, oil, and garlic as your body can process without suffering a systematic failure.\"\nPineapple fluff for dessert, which the Collins called \"a bit of delicious New Orleans kitsch.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

By 1981, Le Bec-Fin was known as the leader of the \"Philadelphia restaurant revolution.\" The restaurant moved to its final location at 1523 Walnut Street in 1983.

Perrier's cuisine favors traditional French ingredients with high-quality produce from throughout the world. The wine list favored selections from the borders of France and some standouts from the new world.\nPerrier made extensive changes to the restaurant after the Mobil Travel Guide reduced it to 4-star status in the 2001 Mobil Travel Guide.  The interior was remodeled, the wine list expanded, and Perrier relinquished command of his restaurant to the head chef.  Perrier said to his staff, \"Change everything but the chandeliers.\"  In the 2003 guide, the fifth star was restored.\nOn April 4, 2008, Le Bec-Fin gave up its 5-star rating in favor of a more relaxed atmosphere. This loss dropped the number of American 5-star restaurants to 16. The change to a more relaxed atmosphere included \u00e0 la carte dining as opposed to a fixed price menu with a strict seating schedule.In January 2009, the French government awarded Perrier the Legion d'Honneur.Although he denied it at first, Georges Perrier put the building up for sale in 2010. During a dinner at the restaurant several months later, however, he announced that he would keep the restaurant open indefinitely. Prompted by an unfavorable review, Perrier announced his retirement in February 2012 and sold Le Bec-Fin to one of its former managers, Nicolas Fanucci, who re-opened the restaurant in June 2012 after remodeling and making minor adjustments. Master chef Walter Abrams, formerly of the restaurant French Laundry, led the kitchen, stressing locally-grown ingredients and fresh produce.Upon hearing of the restaurant's closure, filmmaker Erika Frankel began making a documentary on Perrier and his restaurant.

The dish is simmered at low heat, and stirred from time to time so that the fish does not stick to the casserole.  The fish simmer as the broth is then reduced, usually about twenty minutes.\nWhen the bouillabaisse is done, the rouille is prepared: the stem of the garlic is removed; the garlic cloves are crushed into a fine paste with a pestle in a mortar; the egg yolk and saffron are added and blended with olive oil little by little to make a mayonnaise.\nThe potatoes are peeled, cut into large slices and boiled in salted water for 15 to 20 minutes.\nThe last step is to open the sea urchins with a pair of scissors, and to remove the corail (gonads)  with a small spoon.

The current Jake's Restaurant and its predecessor establishments date back to 1892, establishing it as Portland's second oldest continuously operating restaurant. The original restaurant was called Mueller and Meier, a saloon established in 1892 at 18th and Washington Streets. This restaurant was one of two crawfish houses in Portland at the turn of the century. Mueller and Meier moved to the Whitney & Gray Building in 1911, where it operated as a saloon until 1913, when it became Mueller and Meier Cafe. In 1916 statewide prohibition took effect in Oregon and the restaurant began a soft drink service, a focus that continued throughout Prohibition.\nIn 1920, Mueller and Meier sold their interests to Jacob J. Freiman and J. Rometsch. Jake Freiman, the original \"Jake\", had been a waiter at the Quelle Restaurant, a crawfish house established by Fritz Sichtem and Baron Schlenk in 1893. Freiman, a popular waiter and local character, brought with him the crawfish expertise, a large customer following, and popularity which established the reputation that has continued to the current day.\n\nIn 1921, or 1922, Rometsch left or was bought out by Clem Hackman, and the latter association continued until 1933 when Jake died. The operation was then sold to Joseph Kaffesieder. Joe Kaffesieder, an outgoing personality himself, maintained the traditions and character of the restaurant and, in fact, also was known to many patrons as \"Jake\". The restaurant was later operated by Max Kaffesieder, Joe's son. Walter E. Holman Sr., acquired the restaurant in 1946 and operated it until 1958, when he sold the establishment to his son Walter Jr., who operated in until 1960.

Most experts agree the dish originated in Hangzhou. The clay-wrapped method of slow cooking is thousands of years old.Various legends surround the origins of beggar's chicken. In one, a beggar stole a chicken from a farm but having no pot or utensils, he wrapped the bird in lotus leaves and packed clay or mud around it, set it in a hole where he had lit a fire, and buried it. When he dug up the chicken and cracked open the clay, he found the meat was tender and aromatic. In other versions, the beggar stole the chicken from the emperor and used the mud-hole method to avoid smoke that might attract the imperial guards. Alternatively, the emperor stopped to dine with the beggar and so enjoyed the dish that he added it to the imperial menu and the beggar prospered by selling the dish to locals. Another legend, the dish was a childhood favorite of Emperor Gaozu of Han, who had been born a peasant. When he became emperor, the recipe became an imperial specialty.

Linguistic and genetic evidence suggests that the Romani originated in the Indian subcontinent, in particular the region of present-day Rajasthan. Their subsequent westward migration, possibly in waves, is now believed by historians to have occurred around 1000 CE. Their original name is from the Sanskrit word \u0921\u094b\u092e, doma and means a member of the Dom caste of travelling musicians and dancers. The Roma population moved west into the Persian Ghaznavid Empire and later into the Byzantine Empire. The Roma are thought to have arrived in Europe around the 13th to 14th century. Although they are widely dispersed, their most concentrated populations are located in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Spain, and Turkey.\nIn the English language, Romani people have long been known by the exonym Gypsies or Gipsies, which some Roma consider a racial slur. However, this is not always the case; for example, the term is actually preferred by most English and Welsh Romanies, and is used to refer to them in government documentation. The attendees of the first World Romani Congress in 1971 unanimously voted to reject the use of all exonyms for the Romani, including \"Gypsy\".Since the 19th century, some Romani have also migrated to the Americas. There are an estimated 1 million Roma in the United States and between 800,000 and 1 million in Brazil, most of whose ancestors emigrated in the 19th century from eastern Europe. Brazilian Romani are mostly descendant from German/Italian Sinti (in the South/Southeast regions), and Roma and Calon people. Brazil also includes a notable Romani community descended from Sinti and Roma deportees from the Portuguese Empire during the Portuguese Inquisition. In migrations since the late 19th century, Romani have also moved to other countries in South America and Canada. Though often confused with Irish Travellers and the Yenish people in western Europe, the Romani are culturally different.The Romani language is an Indo-Aryan language with strong Balkan and Greek influence. It is divided into several dialects, which together are estimated to have more than two million speakers. Because the language has traditionally been oral, many Romani are native speakers of the dominant language in their country of residence, or else of mixed languages combining the dominant language with a dialect of Romani in varieties sometimes called para-Romani.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Other ingredients may include caraway seeds, whole or quartered apples for additional flavor or cranberry for flavor and better keeping (the benzoic acid in cranberries is a common preservative). Bell peppers and beets are added in some recipes for color. The resulting sauerkraut salad is typically served cold, as zakuski or a side dish.\nA homemade type of very mild sauerkraut is available, where white cabbage is pickled with salt in a refrigerator for only three to seven days. This process results in very little lactic acid production. Sometimes in Russia double fermentation is used, with the initial step producing an exceptionally sour product, which is then \"corrected\" by adding 30-50% more fresh cabbage and fermenting the mix again. The flavor additives like apples, beets, cranberries, and sometimes even watermelons are usually introduced at this step.\nSauerkraut may be used as a filling for Polish pierogi, Ukrainian varenyky, Russian pirogi and pirozhki. Sauerkraut is also the central ingredient in traditional soups, such as shchi (a national dish of Russia), kwa\u015bnica (Poland), kapustnica (Slovakia), and zel\u0148a\u010dka (Czech Republic resp. Moravian).

In South Tyrol, it is made with Juniper berries, Extra-virgin olive oil and smoked pancetta. Traditionally it is served warm, with pork (e.g. eisbein, schweinshaxe, Kassler) or sausages (smoked or fried sausages, Frankfurter W\u00fcrstchen, Vienna sausages, black pudding), accompanied typically by roasted or steamed potatoes or dumplings (kn\u00f6del or schupfnudel). Similar recipes are common in other Central European cuisines. The Czech national dish vep\u0159o knedlo zelo consists of roast pork with knedliky and sauerkraut.\nIn Bulgaria, Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia, North Macedonia and Slovenia, usually the whole cabbage heads are pickled. Such produce is used for many dishes, from a simple salad made of chopped cabbage and sprinkled with paprika, to cabbage rolls. In northern parts of Serbia and Croatia, it is often added to the bean soup. In central Serbia, a local specialty called \"wedding cabbage\" is made by slowly stewing roughly cut cabbage with at least three kinds of meats, lean, fatty, and smoked.\nIn Romania, the local type of sauerkraut (\"varza murata\" = whole pickled cabbage heads) are used as wrap for the national dish called \"Sarmale\", a Turkish-inspired roll, made of pickled cabbage leaves with minced pork and rice, having its own personality and very distinct in taste from its Ottoman predecessor.\nIn France, sauerkraut is the main ingredient of the Alsatian meal choucroute garnie (French for \"dressed sauerkraut\"), sauerkraut with sausages (Strasbourg sausages, smoked Morteau or Montb\u00e9liard sausages), charcuterie (bacon, ham, etc.), and often potatoes.\nIn Chile it is called chucrut and is a common topping for sandwiches and hotdogs, especially for completos.\nSauerkraut, along with pork, is eaten traditionally in Pennsylvania on New Year's Day. The tradition, started by the Pennsylvania Dutch, is thought to bring good luck for the upcoming year.

The overall flavor of soy sauce is a result of the balance and interaction among different taste components. The saltiness is largely attributed to the presence of NaCl (common salt) in brine. The sugars hydrolyzed from starch add sweetness into soy sauce. Umami is largely caused by the presence of free amino acids, mainly glutamine and aspartic acid. Sodium from the brine and disodium ribonucleotides from the soy also add to the umami.

It is common to the cuisines of Central, Northern, Eastern and Southeastern Europe and much of Western Asia, Northern China, as well as parts of North Africa.\nMeat fillings are traditional in Europe, and include beef, lamb, or pork seasoned with garlic, onion, and spices. Grains such as rice and barley, mushrooms, and vegetables are often included as well. Fermented cabbage leaves are used for wrapping, particularly in southeastern Europe. In Asia, seafoods, tofu, and shiitake mushrooms or Vegeta may also be used. Chinese cabbage is often used as a wrapping.\nCabbage leaves are stuffed with the filling which are then baked, simmered, or steamed in a covered pot and generally eaten warm, often accompanied with a sauce. The sauce varies widely by cuisine. In Sweden and Finland, stuffed cabbage is served with lingonberry jam, which is both sweet and tart. In Central and Eastern Europe, tomato-based sauces and sour cream are typical. In Lebanon, the cabbage is stuffed with rice and minced meat and only rolled to the size of a cigar. It is usually served with a side dish of yogurt and a type of lemon and olive oil vinaigrette seasoned with garlic and dried mint.\nThe cabbage roll is a staple in the Romanian cuisine with variations of the recipe and sizing depending on the region, typically taking up to 6 hours to cook. Traditionally made with pork, beef, bacon, rice, spices and aromatics, broiled in a tomato sauce and served with polenta, sour cream and spicy pickled peppers.\nCooking textbook author Nancy Krcek stated that the origins are unclear and that it is possible multiple groups of people invented it at the same time. Another cooking book author Malgorzata Caprari stated it is believed that credit is owed to the poorer inhabitants of Central and Eastern European countries. Due to the widespread cultivation of cabbage in these regions, it is likely that the cultures who inhabited them were the original inventors of this dish.Cabbage rolls have found their way into popular culture, becoming one of the most recognizable dishes in Central and Eastern European cuisine. They often appear in literature and films as a symbol of homey comfort and tradition.\nA version called holishkes is traditionally eaten by Jews on Simchat Torah.

{"id": "2012_194", "question": "What type of cuisine is pizza?", "ctxs": [{"id": "2012_65162", "text": "Records of pizza-like foods can be found throughout ancient history. In the 6th century BC, the Persian soldiers of the Achaemenid Empire during the rule of Darius the Great baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of their battle shields and the ancient Greeks supplemented their bread with oils, herbs, and cheese. An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the Aeneid, when Celaeno, queen of the Harpies, foretells that the Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book VII, Aeneas and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables. When they eat the bread, they realize that these are the \"tables\" prophesied by Celaeno. In 2023, archeologists discovered a fresco in Pompeii appearing to depict a pizza-like dish among other foodstuffs and staples on a silver platter. Italy's culture minister said it \"may be a distant ancestor of the modern dish\". The first mention of the word pizza comes from a notarial document written in Latin and dating to May 997 AD from Gaeta, demanding a payment of \"twelve pizzas, a pork shoulder, and a pork kidney on Christmas Day, and 12 pizzas and a couple of chickens on Easter Day\".Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century. Before that time, flatbread was often topped with ingredients such as garlic, salt, lard, and cheese. It is uncertain when tomatoes were first added and there are many conflicting claims, though it certainly could not have been before the 16th century and the Columbian Exchange. Pizza was sold from open-air stands and out of pizza bakeries until about 1830, when pizzerias in Naples started to have stanze with tables where clients could sit and eat their pizzas on the spot.A popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, pizza Margherita, was invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo (pizza maker) Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three different pizzas he created, the Queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed in the colors of the Italian flag\u2014red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella). Supposedly, this kind of pizza was then named after the Queen, with an official letter of recognition from the Queen's \"head of service\" remaining to this day on display in Esposito's shop, now called the Pizzeria Brandi. Later research cast doubt on this legend, undermining the authenticity of the letter of recognition, pointing that no media of the period reported about the supposed visit and that both the story and name Margherita were first promoted in the 1930s\u20131940s.Pizza was taken to the United States by Italian immigrants in the late nineteenth century and first appeared in areas where they concentrated. The country's first pizzeria, Lombardi's, opened in New York City in 1905. Following World War II, veterans returning from the Italian Campaign, who were introduced to Italy's native cuisine, proved a ready market for pizza in particular.The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (lit.\u2009'True Neapolitan Pizza Association') is a non-profit organization founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples that aims to promote traditional Neapolitan pizza. In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish, and in 2017 the art of its making was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The Spanish paella, and the South Asian pilau or pulao, and biryani, evolved from such dishes.\nAccording to author K. T. Achaya, the Indian epic Mahabharata mentions an instance of rice and meat cooked together. Also, according to Achaya, \"pulao\" or \"pallao\" is used to refer to a rice dish in ancient Sanskrit works such as the Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya Sm\u1e5bti. However, according to food writers Colleen Taylor Sen and Charles Perry, and social theorist Ashis Nandy, these references do not substantially correlate to the commonly used meaning and history implied in pilafs, which appear in Indian accounts after the medieval Central Asian conquests.Similarly Alexander the Great and his army, many centuries earlier, in the 4th century BCE, have been reported to be so impressed with Bactrian and Sogdian pilavs that his soldiers brought the recipes back to Macedonia when they returned. Similar stories exist of Alexander introducing pilaf to Samarkand; however, they are considered apocryphal by art historian John Boardman. Similarly, it has been reported that pilaf was consumed in the Byzantine Empire and in the Republic of Venice.The earliest documented recipe for pilaf comes from the tenth-century Persian scholar Avicenna (Ibn S\u012bn\u0101), who in his books on medical sciences dedicated a whole section to preparing various dishes, including several types of pilaf. In doing so, he described the advantages and disadvantages of every item used for preparing the dish. Accordingly, Persians consider Ibn Sina to be the \"father\" of modern pilaf. Thirteenth-century Arab texts describe the consistency of pilaf that the grains should be plump and somewhat firm to resemble peppercorns with no mushiness, and each grain should be separate with no clumping.Another primary source for pilaf dishes comes from the 17th-century Iranian philosopher Molla Sadra.Pilau became standard fare in the Middle East and Transcaucasia over the years with variations and innovations by the Persians, Arabs, Turks, and Armenians.\nDuring the period of the Soviet Union, the Central Asian versions of the dish spread throughout all Soviet republics, becoming a part of the common Soviet cuisine.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "2012_200", "question": "What type of cuisine does Don Pablo's serve?", "ctxs": [{"id": "2012_65193", "text": "This chain of Tex-Mex restaurants was started by Texas-based DF&R Restaurants Inc. in 1985. After a period of rapid growth throughout the state of Texas, Don Pablo's began to build new locations in the Midwest.By 1995, DF&R had 51 Don Pablo's locations which led Madison, Georgia-based Apple South to notice the chain's successful growth and to purchase DF&R later that year. At the time of the purchase, Apple South was one of the largest franchise holders in the Applebee's restaurant system with 170 Applebee's restaurants, and operated restaurants from other franchise chains, most of which were located in the South and Midwest. Two years later, Apple South decided to divest all of its 264 Applebee's franchises (in a franchise system that had 960 units), along with its other franchise properties, to focus its efforts on the 120-unit Don Pablo's and the other company-owned chains. Shortly after the Applebee's restaurant divestiture, Apple South changed its name to Avado Brands to emphasise the change of business.Things did not go as well as Avado had originally planned, and it filed for bankruptcy in 2004. At that time, it had 106 Don Pablo's. Avado exited bankruptcy a year later with 96 Don Pablo's in operation. After spending two years trying to revitalize the brand, Avado filed for bankruptcy for the second time in September 2007 and subsequently closed or sold about half of its 90 locations.In February 2008, 41 Don Pablo's locations were acquired by Rita Restaurant Corporation of Madison, Georgia, a fully owned subsidiary of DDJ Capital Management of Waltham, Massachusetts. Rita tried to revitalize the brand by closing under-performing locations and selling franchises. A franchise was sold to a Florida-based operator who re-opened a Don Pablo's in Sarasota, Florida, in 2012. The Sarasota location was the sole remaining franchise until it was finally closed in 2015.In 2014, the 34-unit chain was acquired by San Antonio-based Food Management Partners (FMP). FMP is also a franchise operator of Buffalo Wild Wings and several Italian restaurant chains. While FMP owned the company, locations were closed in February 2014 at Atlanta, Georgia; in August 2014 at Hobart, Indiana; in February 2015 at Canton, Ohio; in April 2015 at Flint, Michigan; in February 2016 at Greenville, South Carolina and Maple Grove, Minnesota; in August 2016 at Richfield, Minnesota and Newport, Kentucky; and in September 2016 at Beavercreek, Ohio and Owings Mills, Maryland.On October 4, 2016, Rita Restaurant Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after nearly cutting the number of Don Pablo's locations in half. At the time of the bankruptcy announcement, all four Indianapolis-area locations along with locations in Battle Creek, Michigan and Toledo, Ohio were immediately closed with little advance warning. At the time of the bankruptcy filing, there were 12 restaurants remaining. By November 2016, the Alexandria, Virginia location quietly disappeared from the Don Pablo's website. The Eden Prairie, Minnesota location quietly disappeared from the Don Pablo's website sometime between February and July 2017. The contents of the Eden Prairie restaurant were auctioned off in March. The Shelby Charter Township, Michigan location disappeared from the Don Pablo's website sometime between July 8 and July 19. In February 2018, the Don Pablo's location in Lafayette, Indiana quietly closed to leave 8 locations.In April 2018, the Grand Prairie, Texas location quietly closed its doors to leave the number of locations at 7 by May 2018.In July 2018, the Norwood, Ohio location closed its doors to leave a total number of 6 locations in Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, and Texas. In September 2018, the Christiana, Delaware restaurant was closed, leaving just 5 restaurants in three states.In early November 2018, the Moorestown, New Jersey, restaurant closed for the final time and about the same time, the listing for the Fort Worth, Texas, restaurant disappeared from the Don Pablo's website to leave three locations. Just two and a half weeks later, the location at White Marsh Mall in Baltimore County, the last location in Maryland, was closed just days before Thanksgiving while the last Don Pablo's restaurant in Texas also disappeared from the website, leaving Deptford Township, New Jersey as the last one in business. The Deptford location finally closed in June 2019.", "hasanswer": false}]}
