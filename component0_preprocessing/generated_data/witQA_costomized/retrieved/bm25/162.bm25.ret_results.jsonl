The song was inspired by Madonna's daughter Lourdes Leon, whom she gave birth to in 1996. These events inspired a period of introspection for the singer. \"That was a big catalyst for me. It took me on a search for answers to questions I'd never asked myself before,\" she said to Q magazine in 2002. Madonna begun writing the song with Leonard during developing her album Ray of Light. However, unlike their previous work dynamics, Leonard gave little input during studio sessions and only co-wrote four songs for the album, including \"Nothing Really Matters\". As a result, Madonna did not want him to produce the track. Her manager Guy Oseary then telephoned Orbit, and suggested that the latter send some songs to Madonna. Orbit sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to her, which included a demo version of \"Nothing Really Matters\"'s music. According to Madonna, she had been a fan of Orbit's work for a long time and was pleased with the demo version, which he started to work on.De Vries, who had worked on the demo, asked Orbit to help produce the song, and was enlisted. According to Madonna: Like an Icon writer Lucy O'Brien, De Vries and Orbit had originally composed and produced the track before Ray of Light had been conceived. During the sessions, Orbit found De Vries' contribution \"off-putting\", to which the latter confessed, \"On all the collaborations I'd left a lot of space for him, but for this I wanted to put something on the table and say, 'This is what I think'\". De Vries had added electronic noise frequencies during the first chorus of the song, stating that he had a \"vision on how the song should be finished\". Orbit did not like the addition since it sounded to him that the \"DAT's broken\". De Vries defended his contribution saying that it was supposed to be \"like that [...] It's quite slow for a dance tune of that nature, not a pacey tune.\" Madonna had enjoyed all three of their contributions to the track, and as a result, Orbit reluctantly left it on. In J. Randy Taraborrelli's book Madonna: An Intimate Biography, the singer said that the main inspiration behind \"Nothing Really Matters\" and \"The Power of Good-Bye\" from the same album, was other people judging and dissecting her creative process. Elaborating on the statement, she added,\n\nIn 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I want people to have a visceral and emotional reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I wanted to say that it does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't want people to be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "162_25", "question": "Who was the producer of Exile on Main St.?", "ctxs": [{"id": "162_67810", "text": "Exile on Main St. is a studio album by the English rock band the Rolling Stones, released on 26 May 1972 by Rolling Stones Records. The 10th released in the UK and 12th in the US, it is viewed as a culmination of a string of the band's most critically successful albums, following Beggars Banquet (1968), Let It Bleed (1969) and Sticky Fingers (1971). Exile on Main St. is known for its murky, inconsistent sound due to more disjointed musicianship and production, along with a party-like atmosphere heard in several tracks.\nRecording began in 1969 at Olympic Studios in London during sessions for Sticky Fingers, with the main sessions beginning in mid-1971 at a rented villa in the South of France named Nellc\u00f4te after the band became tax exiles. Due to the lack of a professional studio nearby, they worked with a mobile recording studio and recorded in-house. The loose and unorganised Nellc\u00f4te sessions went on for hours into the night, with personnel varying greatly from day to day. Recording was completed with overdub sessions at Sunset Sound in Los Angeles and included additional musicians such as the pianist Nicky Hopkins, the saxophonist Bobby Keys, the drummer and producer Jimmy Miller, and the horn player Jim Price. The results produced enough songs for the Stones' first double album.\nThe band continued a back-to-basics direction heard in Sticky Fingers after the experimental instrumentation of previous albums, yet Exile exhibited a wider range of influences in blues, rock and roll, swing, country and gospel, while the lyrics explored themes related to hedonism, sex and time. The album contains frequently-performed concert staples and topped the charts in six countries, including the UK, US and Canada. It included the singles \"Happy\", which featured lead vocals from Keith Richards, country music ballad \"Sweet Virginia\", and worldwide top-ten hit \"Tumbling Dice\". The album's artwork, a collage of various images, reflected the Rolling Stones' prideful rebellion. After its release, the Stones embarked on an American tour, gaining infamy for riotous audiences and performances.\nExile on Main St. was originally met with mixed reviews before receiving strong reassessments by the end of the 1970s. It has since been recognized as a pivotal hard rock album, viewed by many critics as the Rolling Stones' best work and as one of the greatest albums of all time. Rolling Stone magazine ranked the album number 7 on its list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" in 2003 and 2012, with it dropping to number 14 in the 2020 and 2023 editions, consistently as the highest-ranked Rolling Stones album on the list. In 2012, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, the band's fourth album to be inducted. A remastered and expanded version of the album was released in 2010 featuring a bonus disc with 10 new tracks. Unusual for a re-release, it also charted highly at the time of its release, reaching number one in the UK and number two in the US.", "hasanswer": true}]}

It was directed by Richard Reines and Brad Scott. The video premiered on Refused TV on May 24, 2002. Around the end of 2002, the band signed to MCA Records. MCA had a distribution deal that allowed them to acquire Drive-Thru Records' bands over time.

In January 2003, \"What It Is to Burn\" was released to radio stations across the United States as the lead single from What Is It to Burn. Strohmeyer said that up to that point, \"Letters to You\" served as an \"unofficial single\" as radio stations were picking up the song and adding it to their rotation, which was \"really cool because we didn't have to spend a dime\" to promote it. A music video was filmed for \"What It Is to Burn\" with director by director Alexander Kosta. The video was posted online on February 12, 2003. In March of that year, Punknews.org held a contest where fans could win a copy of the album on vinyl. On April 22, 2003, \"Letters to You\" was released on CD as What Is It to Burn's second single. Two versions of the CD single were released: the first with \"Worms of the Earth\" and \"New Kid\" as extra tracks, and the second with live versions of \"Perfection Through Silence\" and \"Letters to You\" as bonus tracks. Following this, \"New Beginnings\" and \"What It Is to Burn\" were released on a double A-sided as the album's third and final single on August 25, 2003.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He is dismissed for his constant disregard for hospital rules, which are bound by bureaucratic red tape. The reason for his conflict is his steadily rising interest in research for selective color staining, the marking of cells and microorganisms using certain dyes and marking agents which have a certain 'affinity' for their target and nothing else. Emil von Behring, whom Dr. Ehrlich meets and befriends while experimenting with his staining techniques, is impressed with Dr. Ehrlich's staining methods and refers to it as 'specific staining,' adding that this optical microscopy  diagnostic technique is one of the greatest achievements in science. \nAfter attending a medical presentation of the eminent Dr. Robert Koch demonstrating that tuberculosis is a bacterial disease, Ehrlich is able to obtain a sample of the isolated bacterium. After an intense time of research and experimentation in his own lab, paired with a portion of luck and thanks to the empathy of his wife, he is able to develop a viable staining process for the microbe. This result is honored by Koch and medical circles as another highly valuable contribution to diagnostics.\nDuring his work Dr. Ehrlich is infected with tuberculosis, then an often-deadly, uncurable disease. To recover, Ehrlich travels with his wife Hedwig to the hot dry climate of Egypt. There he starts to discover the properties of immunity. This discovery helps Ehrlich and colleague Dr. von Behring to fight a diphtheria epidemic that is killing off many children in the country. The two doctors are rewarded for their efforts.\nEhrlich concentrates on work to create \"magic bullets\" - chemicals injected into the blood to fight various diseases, thus pioneering antibiotic chemotherapy for infectious diseases. Ehrlich's laboratory has the help of a number of scientists like Sahachiro Hata. The medical board, headed by Dr. Hans Wolfert, believes much of Ehrlich's work is a waste of money and resources and fight for a reduction, just as Ehrlich begins to work on a cure for syphilis. Ehrlich is financially backed by the widow of Jewish banker Georg Speyer, Franziska Speyer, and after 606 tries he finally discovers the remedy for the disease. This substance, first called \"606\", then Salvarsan, is now known as Arsphenamine.\nThe joy of discovery is short-lived, as 38 patients who receive the treatment die. Dr. Wolfert denounces the cure publicly and accuses Ehrlich of murdering those who died from the cure. As faith in the new cure starts to dwindle, Ehrlich is forced to sue Wolfert for libel and in the process exonerate 606. Dr. von Behring (who had earlier told Ehrlich to give up his pipe dreams of cures by chemicals), is called by the defense to denounce 606. Behring instead states that he believes that 606 is responsible for a 39th death: the death of syphilis itself. Ehrlich is exonerated, but the strain and stress from the trial are too much for his weakened body and he dies shortly thereafter, his final words being counsel to his assistants and colleagues on the risks involved in advancing medicine.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She approached hip hop producer Rockwilder and suggested using Redman's 2001 song \"Let's Get Dirty (I Can't Get in da Club)\" as a guide. The final result, \"Dirrty\", is an R&B and hip hop song that also features rapping verses from Redman and describes sexual activities.\nRCA Records sent \"Dirrty\" to American radio stations on September 3, 2002, as the lead single from Stripped. RCA and Bertelsmann Music Group later released the song as a CD single. The song peaked at number 48 on the US Billboard 100. Outside of the United States, \"Dirrty\" saw significant success in the British Isles, topping the charts in Ireland and the United Kingdom. Elsewhere, the song peaked within the top ten in many countries including Australia, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.\nDavid LaChapelle directed the music video for \"Dirrty\", which was intended to publicize Aguilera's new image. Depicting sexual fetishes such as mud wrestling and muscle worshipping, the controversial video eliminated her previous image as a bubblegum pop singer. Various news publications and other recording artists criticized the video, and it was banned on Thai television, but Aguilera defended the video, calling it inspirational as it put her to the forefront. \"Dirrty\" was included on the setlists of Aguilera's five major concert tours: The Justified & Stripped Tour (2003), The Stripped Tour (2003), Back to Basics Tour (2006\u20132008), The Liberation Tour (2018), and The X Tour (2019).", "hasanswer": true}]}

The film reached Liverpool, England, in the early summer of 1957. The cameo performances of early rock 'n' roll stars such as Little Richard, Eddie Cochran, and Gene Vincent and His Bluecaps fascinated a 16-year-old John Lennon by showing him, for the first time, his \"worshipped\" American rock 'n' roll stars as living humans and thus further inspiring him to pursue his own rock 'n' roll dream. On July 6, 1957, 15-year-old Paul McCartney was introduced to Lennon after the latter had performed at a village church garden party with his skiffle group The Quarrymen. McCartney demonstrated his musical prowess to Lennon by performing \"Twenty Flight Rock\" in a manner similar to how he had seen it played by Eddie Cochran in The Girl Can't Help It. This led to Lennon inviting McCartney to join the group. McCartney talks about the film in the documentary series The Beatles Anthology.On September 18, 1968, The Beatles interrupted recording \"Birthday\" at Abbey Road Studios so they could go back to Paul McCartney's house to watch the British TV premiere of the film.Also, some film buffs have pointed to Elvis Presley's famous performance of the song \"Jailhouse Rock\" in MGM's film of the same name (often cited as the first music video), released one year after The Girl Can't Help It, as bearing a remarkable resemblance to the theme and performance of a song called \"Rock Around the Rockpile\" from the earlier film. In that performance, Edmond O'Brien plays a character who seeks to escape an assassination attempt by jumping on stage and singing the lyrics, \"rock, rock, rock around the rockpile,\" while backed up by The Ray Anthony Band wearing striped inmate uniforms. O'Brien, then 42 years old, even awkwardly attempts some of the hip-swiveling and leg motions for which Elvis had already become famous, as he had appeared already 10 times, to cumulative audiences in excess of 180 million viewers, and on national television, before and during the filming of The Girl Can't Help It, the production of which commenced in mid-September 1956. Other film buffs point to the famous acrobatic dancer and Presley contemporary, as well as MGM star, Russ Tamblyn (Seven Brides for Seven Brothers), who visited Presley at his suite at the Knickerbocker Hotel on the night before the filming of the \"Jailhouse Rock\" scene. Presley had had trouble that day at the rehearsals in interpreting what the MGM choreographer, Alex Romero, demanded of him, and Tamblyn's advice at the suite that night helped him perform the first part of that dance sequence (which, incidentally, was witnessed by the then-MGM megastar Gene Kelly).  In fact, The Girl Can't Help It's producers had sought to enlist Presley, whose manager, Colonel Tom Parker, however, had demanded too much money. Two uncredited composers on The Girl Can't Help It, Hugo Friedhofer and Lionel Newman, had also composed music for the Elvis film Love Me Tender, in the same year, 1956.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The terrifying (and instantly recognizable) \"Dies irae\" that introduces the traditional sequence of the Latin funeral rite is repeated throughout. Trumpets surround the stage to produce a call to judgement in the \"Tuba mirum\", and the almost oppressive atmosphere of the \"Rex tremendae\" creates a sense of unworthiness before the King of Tremendous Majesty. Yet the well-known tenor solo \"Ingemisco\" radiates hope for the sinner who asks for the Lord's mercy.\nThe \"Sanctus\" (a complicated eight-part fugue scored for double chorus) begins with a brassy fanfare to announce him \"who comes in the name of the Lord\". Finally the \"Libera me\", the oldest music by Verdi in the Requiem, interrupts. Here the soprano cries out, begging, \"Deliver me, Lord, from eternal death ... when you will come to judge the world by fire.\"\nWhen the Requiem was composed, female singers were not permitted to perform in Catholic Church rituals (such as a requiem mass). However, from the beginning Verdi intended to use female singers in the work. In his open letter proposing the Requiem project (when it was still conceived as a multi-author Requiem for Rossini), Verdi wrote: \"If I were in the good graces of the Holy Father\u2014Pope Pius IX\u2014I would beg him to permit\u2014if only for this one time\u2014that women take part in the performance of this music; but since I am not, it will fall to someone else better suited to obtain this decree.\" In the event, when Verdi composed the Requiem alone, two of the four soloists were sopranos, and the chorus included female voices. This may have slowed the work's acceptance in Italy.At the time of its premiere, the Requiem was criticized by some as being too operatic in style for the religious subject matter. According to Gundula Kreuzer, \"Most critics did perceive a schism between the religious text (with all its musical implications) and Verdi's setting.\" Some viewed it negatively as \"an opera in ecclesiastical robes\", or alternatively, as a religious work, but one in \"dubious musical costume\". While the majority of critics agreed that the music was \"dramatic\", some felt that such treatment of the text was appropriate, or at least permissible. As to the quality of the music, the critical consensus agreed that the work displayed \"fluent invention, beautiful sound effects and charming vocal writing\". Critics were divided between praise and condemnation with respect to Verdi's willingness to break standard compositional rules for musical effect, such as his use of consecutive fifths.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The Count was often ill and had sleepless nights. At such times, Goldberg, who lived in his house, had to spend the night in an antechamber, so as to play for him during his insomnia. ... Once the Count mentioned in Bach's presence that he would like to have some clavier pieces for Goldberg, which should be of such a smooth and somewhat lively character that he might be a little cheered up by them in his sleepless nights. Bach thought himself best able to fulfill this wish by means of Variations, the writing of which he had until then considered an ungrateful task on account of the repeatedly similar harmonic foundation. But since at this time all his works were already models of art, such also these variations became under his hand. Yet he produced only a single work of this kind. Thereafter the Count always called them his variations. He never tired of them, and for a long time sleepless nights meant: \"Dear Goldberg, do play me one of my variations.\" Bach was perhaps never so rewarded for one of his works as for this. The Count presented him with a golden goblet filled with 100 Louis d'or. Nevertheless, even had the gift been a thousand times larger, their artistic value would not yet have been paid for.\nForkel wrote his biography in 1802, more than 60 years after the events related, and its accuracy has been questioned. The lack of dedication on the title page also makes the tale of the commission unlikely. Goldberg's age at the time of publication (14 years) has also been cited as grounds for doubting Forkel's tale, although it must be said that he was known to be an accomplished keyboardist and sight-reader. Williams (2001) contends that the Forkel story is entirely spurious.\nArnold Schering has suggested that the aria on which the variations are based was not written by Bach.

By March 2008, plans for their Close to the Edge and Back Tour in celebration of the band's fortieth anniversary were in progress. Wakeman was advised not to participate due to health reasons and recommended his son Oliver Wakeman as a replacement, which the band accepted. However, all plans were cancelled in May 2008 after Anderson had an asthma attack and was diagnosed with respiratory failure. With further time required for Anderson to recover, Squire, White and Howe wished to waste no more time and continued with rehearsals for a rescheduled tour with Oliver Wakeman in the line-up. In June, during their search for a new singer, Squire invited Beno\u00eet David, a Canadian singer who fronted the Yes cover band Close to the Edge, to join the band. Squire found out about David after he saw a video of the group performing on YouTube and was impressed with his ability to sing in a style similar to Anderson. Yes toured worldwide from November 2008 to December 2010, during which they agreed to start work on a new studio album, the band's first since Magnification (2001).\nYes started on the album in March 2010 during their stay in Phoenix, Arizona, during which ideas of songs from Howe, Squire, and Wakeman were selected to develop further with the intention of Howe and Wakeman as co-producers with Wakeman as recording engineer. Wakeman recalled a period of \"lovely integration\" between the three of them during this time, although Squire wanted greater involvement in the production and David was unsure if the decision for the band self-produce was right. Wakeman then suggested that Yes contact producer and former Yes frontman Trevor Horn, who had replaced a departing Anderson in 1980 and sung on Drama (1980) with Geoff Downes, his partner in The Buggles, on keyboards, to bring more validity to the album.Horn accepted the invitation, and the group initially planned to work with Horn only on \"We Can Fly\", a song that originated from a demo titled \"We Can Fly from Here\" that Horn and Downes had recorded prior to their arrival in Yes. The song was performed live during the Drama tour in 1980, and the band rehearsed it for a short while with session drummer Paul Robinson. When Yes disbanded in 1981, Horn and Downes recorded a second demo of \"We Can Fly from Here\", this time as a two-part song that was released on a reissue of The Buggles's second album Adventures in Modern Recording (1981). Before David put down his vocal tracks, Horn recorded vocals himself for him to use as a guide, so David could \"sing it exactly the same way\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

The film doesn't really talk down to anyone.\"In a 2018 interview with Twomey, she revealed that Angelina Jolie was involved in the casting of the voice actors, in particular the Canadian talent Saara Chaudry who voices Parvana, as Twomey recalls \"She [Chaudry] has such empathy, intellect and emotional depth, a unique talent for an 11 year old actor.\" Choudry's personality also played a role in shaping Parvana's mannerisms, as Twomey explains in another interview, \u201cSeeing what Saara was able to comprehend as an actor, as an artist, and as a child gave me an understanding of how to craft our film [in a way] that doesn't take for granted what children are afraid of or not afraid of.\u201dTwomey also explained that Jolie's insight as UN Goodwill ambassador at Afghan girls' schools was helpful in making the film, as she reportedly offered advice on the intricacies of Afghan behavior codes and the cultural atmosphere of Afghanistan. Mimi Polk Gitlin, producer of the feminist classic Thelma and Louise, was also involved as an executive producer.Twomey also explained that she was careful to cast voice actors of Afghan heritage and to work with an Afghan dialect coach. She says, \u201cthere was so much input from people there at the time, to make sure it was not judgemental but also empathetic\u201d. The Kabul-born dialect coach, Kawa Abu, also voices the character of Razaq. According to Twomey, the story-within-a-story about the mythical Elephant king was inspired by Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth.  The texture and depth of the vivid fairy-tale fable and distinctive cut-out look was created using Nuke compositing software, from the Toronto-based Guru Studio.During the development of the screenplay, screenwriter Anita Doron worked together with the American-Afghan artist Aman Mojadidi, to balance an Afghan perspective with a global perspective to capture the universal tone of the film. The first draft of the screenplay also saw contributions from the Afghan Women's Organization, as various Afghan refugees from different regions and tribes offered their perspectives and deepened the film's understanding of the Afghan culture.School children along with their parents were invited for an early screening of the film, as Twomey noted that parents became emotional and teary whereas children, taking note from Parvana, were cheerful and chatty.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Richard Brownlow, who established the family's wealth, began negotiations to acquire the manor from Sir Henry Pakenham in 1603 and secured its reversion to him six years later.

This occasion financially ruined the Pakenhams and led to the resignation of their interest in the property to Brownlow in exchange for a lifelong annuity.

John Brownlow had, however, become attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard, who married in 1676 when both were aged 16.After inheriting the estates of their great-uncle, Alice and John Brownlow sought to enter London high society. To that end, they bought a town house in the newly fashionable Southampton Square in Bloomsbury and decided to build a new country house at Belton to flaunt their wealth.

Lennon and Ono were rarely in the studio at the same time, primarily because Ono did not want Lennon imposing himself in her work. They produced dozens of songs, enough to fill Double Fantasy and a large part of a projected second album, Milk and Honey.\nLennon wanted to work with different musicians than he had previously, and had Douglas assemble and rehearse the band without telling them who they would be recording with.

The Cheap Trick version of \"I'm Losing You\" was included on the John Lennon Anthology collection released in 1998.The sessions remained top secret. According to Douglas, this was because Lennon was not confident in his work, feeling that he was out of touch with the contemporary music scene and could no longer write or sing up to the standard he set in his heyday, and wanted to be able to discreetly abort the sessions if he felt they were not turning out well; at one point he spoke of giving most of the songs he wrote for the album to his ex-bandmate Ringo Starr.

{"id": "162_165", "question": "Who was the producer of \"Black Is Black\"?", "ctxs": [{"id": "86_51707", "text": "Ira Gershwin stipulated that only blacks be allowed to play the lead roles when the opera was performed in the United States, launching the careers of several prominent opera singers. Gershwin sought to write a true jazz opera and believed that Metropolitan Opera staff singers could never master the jazz idiom, which could instead only be sung by a black cast. Some black singers were overjoyed at Gershwin's work, going so far as to describe him as the \"Abraham Lincoln of Negro music\".Nevertheless, the opera's depiction of African Americans attracted controversy from the outset. Virgil Thomson, a white American composer, stated that \"Folklore subjects recounted by an outsider are only valid as long as the folk in question is unable to speak for itself, which is certainly not true of the American Negro in 1935.\" An apocryphal quote attributed to Duke Ellington allegedly stated \"the times are here to debunk Gershwin's lampblack Negroisms,\" but the quote was probably invented by a journalist who interviewed Ellington about the opera. Ellington publicly repudiated the article shortly after its publication. Ellington's response to the 1952 Breen revival was completely the opposite. His telegram to the producer read: \"Your Porgy and Bess the superbest, singing the gonest, acting the craziest, Gershwin the greatest.\" Several of the members of the original cast later stated that they, too, had concerns that their characters might play into a stereotype that African Americans lived in poverty, took drugs, and solved their problems with their fists.\nA planned production by the Negro Repertory Company of Seattle in the late 1930s, part of the Federal Theatre Project, was canceled because actors were displeased with what they viewed as a racist portrayal of aspects of African-American life. The director initially envisioned that they would perform the play in a \"Negro dialect.\" These Pacific Northwest African American actors, who did not speak in such dialect, would be coached in it. Florence James attempted a compromise of dropping the use of dialect but the production was canceled.Another production of Porgy and Bess, this time at the University of Minnesota in 1939, ran into similar troubles. According to Barbara Cyrus, one of the few black students then at the university, members of the local African-American community saw the play as \"detrimental to the race\" and as a vehicle that promoted racist stereotypes. The play was canceled due to pressure from the African-American community, which saw their success as proof of the increasing political power of blacks in Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul.The belief that Porgy and Bess was racist gained strength during the civil rights movement and Black Power movement of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. As these movements advanced, Porgy and Bess was seen as more and more out of date. When the play was revived in the 1960s, social critic and African-American educator Harold Cruse called it, \"The most incongruous, contradictory cultural symbol ever created in the Western World.\"In the 1976 Houston Opera production, the director, Sherwin Goldman, had trouble finding interested performers. Goldman, a white Texas native and a graduate of Yale and Oxford Universities, recalled, \"I was auditioning singers all around the country, I guess thirty cities in all, from theater groups to church choirs, but was having a hard time finding directors ... I don't think there was a single black person, of those who had never been associated with Porgy, who didn't seriously bad-mouth it.\" Nevertheless, a cast was assembled of African American classically trained performers from all around the country.\nGershwin's all-black opera was also unpopular with some celebrated black artists. Harry Belafonte declined to play Porgy in the late 1950s film version, so the role went to Sidney Poitier. Poitier found the opera insulting and only took on the film role due to coercion from producer Samuel Goldwyn. Betty Allen, president of The Harlem School of the Arts, admittedly loathed the piece, and Grace Bumbry, who excelled in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production as Bess, made the often cited statement: I thought it beneath me, I felt I had worked far too hard, that we had come far too far to have to retrogress to 1935. My way of dealing with it was to see that it was really a piece of Americana, of American history, whether we liked it or not. Whether I sing it or not, it was still going to be there.\nOver time, however, the opera gained acceptance from the opera community and some in the African-American community. Maurice Peress stated in 2004 that \"Porgy and Bess belongs as much to the black singer-actors who bring it to life as it does to the Heywards and the Gershwins.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Post-production concluded in November 1939, just a month before its premiere.\nIt received generally positive reviews upon its release on December 15, 1939. While the casting was widely praised, the long-running time received criticism. At the 12th Academy Awards, Gone with the Wind received ten Academy Awards (eight competitive, two honorary) from thirteen nominations, including wins for Best Picture, Best Director (Fleming), Best Adapted Screenplay (posthumously awarded to Sidney Howard), Best Actress (Leigh), and Best Supporting Actress (Hattie McDaniel, becoming the first African American to win an Academy Award). It set records for the total number of wins and nominations at the time.\nGone with the Wind was immensely popular when first released. It became the highest-earning film made up to that point and held the record for over a quarter of a century. When adjusted for monetary inflation, it is still the highest-grossing film in history. It was re-released periodically throughout the 20th century and became ingrained in popular culture. Although the film has been criticized as historical negationism, glorifying slavery and the Lost Cause of the Confederacy myth, it has been credited with triggering changes in the way in which African Americans were depicted cinematically. Gone with the Wind is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, and in 1989, became one of the twenty-five inaugural films selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.", "hasanswer": true}]}

It stars Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski, a Los Angeles slacker and avid bowler. He is assaulted as a result of mistaken identity, then learns that a millionaire, also named Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston), was the intended victim. The millionaire Lebowski's trophy wife is supposedly kidnapped, and millionaire Lebowski commissions The Dude to deliver the ransom to secure her release. The plan goes awry when the Dude's friend, Walter Sobchak (John Goodman), schemes to keep the ransom money for the Dude and himself. Sam Elliott, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tara Reid, David Thewlis, Peter Stormare, Jon Polito, and Ben Gazzara also appear in supporting roles.\nThe film is loosely inspired by the work of Raymond Chandler. Joel Coen stated, \"We wanted to do a Chandler kind of story \u2013 how it moves episodically, and deals with the characters trying to unravel a mystery, as well as having a hopelessly complex plot that's ultimately unimportant\". The original score was composed by Carter Burwell, a longtime collaborator of the Coen brothers.\nThe Big Lebowski received mixed reviews at the time of its release. Reviews have since become largely positive, and the film has become a cult favorite, noted for its eccentric characters, comedic dream sequences, idiosyncratic dialogue, and eclectic soundtrack.

The second installment in the Evil Dead film series, it is considered both a remake and sequel (or \"re-quel\") to The Evil Dead (1981). It stars Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams, who vacations with his girlfriend to a remote cabin in the woods. He discovers an audio tape of recitations from a book of ancient texts, and when the recording is played, it unleashes a number of demons which possess and torment him.\nAfter the critical and commercial failure of Crimewave (1985), Raimi, producer Robert Tapert, and Campbell began work on a sequel to The Evil Dead at the insistence of their publicist Irvin Shapiro. Having endorsed the original film, author Stephen King brought the project to the attention of producer Dino De Laurentiis, with whom he had been making his directorial debut Maximum Overdrive (1986). De Laurentiis agreed to provide financial backing, and assigned the filmmakers a considerably larger budget than they had worked with on the original film. Although Raimi had devised a premise set in the Middle Ages and involving time travel, De Laurentiis requested that the film be similar to its predecessor.\nEvil Dead II was shot in Wadesboro, North Carolina and Detroit, Michigan in 1986, and featured extensive stop-motion animation and prosthetic makeup effects created by a team of artists that included Mark Shostrom, Greg Nicotero, Robert Kurtzman and Tom Sullivan, the latter of whom returned from the original film. The finished film was released in the United States on March 13, 1987; due to its high level of violence, it was released through a pseudonymous distributor to curb an anticipated X rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. Much like The Evil Dead, it was widely acclaimed by critics, who praised its humor, Raimi's direction, and Campbell's performance; many have considered it superior to its predecessor and similarly as \none of the greatest horror films ever made. Despite being given a somewhat limited release, it was a minor box office success, grossing just under $6 million.\nAs with the first film, Evil Dead II has accumulated a large, international cult following. In 1992, it was followed by the direct sequel Army of Darkness, which utilized Raimi's original premise; in 2013, it was followed by the soft reboot and continuation Evil Dead; and in 2015, it was followed by the television series Ash vs Evil Dead.

Billboard's terse review, published uncharacteristically late, called it an \"exciting, well-produced LP\" with \"two superb instrumental cuts\" and highlighted the \"strong single potential\" of \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\". Biographer David Leaf wrote in 1978 that the album received \"scattered\" instances of praise from American reviewers; the group's fans initially considered Pet Sounds too challenging and \"quickly passed the word to 'stay away from the new Beach Boys album, it's weird.'\"By contrast, the reception from music journalists in the UK was highly favorable due in part to the promotional efforts of Taylor, Johnston, and Fowley. Rolling Stone founding editor Jann Wenner later recalled that fans in the UK identified the Beach Boys as being \"years ahead\" of the Beatles and declared Wilson a \"genius\" Penny Valentine of Disc and Music Echo admired Pet Sounds as \"Thirteen tracks of Brian Wilson genius ... The whole LP is far more romantic than the usual Beach Boys jollity: sad little wistful songs about lost love and found love and all-around love.\" Writing in Record Mirror, Norman Jopling reported that the LP had been \"widely praised\" and subjected to \"no criticism\". He prefaced his review as \"unbiased\" and wrote that his only \"real complaint\" with the album was the \"terribly complicated and cluttered\" arrangements. Jopling predicted: \"It will probably make their present fans like them even more, but it's doubtful whether it will make them any new ones.\" A reviewer in Disc and Music Echo disagreed: \"this should gain them thousands of new fans. Instrumentally ambitious, if vocally over-pretty, Pet Sounds has brilliantly tapped the pulse of the musical times. ... A superb, important and really exciting collection from the group whose recording career so far has been a bit of a hotchpotch.\"Melody Maker ran a feature in which many pop musicians were asked whether they believed that the album was truly revolutionary and progressive or \"as sickly as peanut butter\". The author concluded that \"the record's impact on artists and the men behind the artists has been considerable.\" Among the musicians contributing to the 1966 Melody Maker survey: Spencer Davis of the Spencer Davis Group said: \"Brian Wilson is a great record producer. I haven't spent much time listening to the Beach Boys before, but I'm a fan now and I just want to listen to this LP again and again.\" Then a member of Cream, Eric Clapton reported that everyone in his band loved the album, adding that Wilson was \"without doubt a pop genius\". Andrew Loog Oldham told the magazine: \"I think that Pet Sounds is the most progressive album of the year in as much as Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade was. It's the pop equivalent of that, a complete exercise in pop music.\"Three of the nine people who are quoted in the Melody Maker survey (Keith Moon, Manfred Mann's Mike d'Abo, and the Walker Brothers' Scott Walker) did not agree that the album was revolutionary. D'Abo and Walker favored the Beach Boys' earlier work, as did journalist and television presenter Barry Fantoni, who expressed a preference for Beach Boys' Today! and stated that Pet Sounds was \"probably revolutionary, but I'm not sure that everything that's revolutionary is necessarily good\". Pete Townshend of the Who opined that \"the Beach Boys new material is too remote and way out. It's written for a feminine audience.\"In other issues of Melody Maker, Rolling Stones member Mick Jagger stated that he disliked the songs but enjoyed the record and its harmonies, while John Lennon said that Wilson was \"doing some very great things\". At the end of 1966, the magazine crowned Pet Sounds and the Beatles' Revolver as the joint \"Pop Album of the Year\". The paper's spokesman wrote, \"We argued, argued and argued and still the MM pop panel couldn't agree which was the Pop Album of the Year.

Cafe), which features many icons from the original TV series, including Chandler and Joey's ugly dog statue, the orange sofa, the purple door of Monica and Rachel's apartment, and Phoebe's pink bicycle. The other three cafes are located in Delhi, Gurgaon; Bhubaneswar, Odisha; and Pune, Maharashtra.There are two Friends themed cafes in Pakistan\u2014one in Lahore, Punjab, known as \"Friends Cafe\" and the other in Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa called \"Central Perk\". Both cafes have an iconic couch, a guitar and foosball table, quotes from the show on the walls and episode reruns on a projector. They're planning to have their own Gunther at the bar.In 2016, a Central Perk replica was opened in Outram, Singapore. It is the only Central Perk that has been given the intellectual property rights by Warner Bros. outside of the United States. The caf\u00e9 includes feature walls, replicating the walls of the main characters' apartments and memorabilia and props used on the show. In August 2019, it was announced that a Central Perk Lego set would be launched to mark the show's 25 anniversary.Friends has also developed an alternative family lifestyle by representing young people who live unconventional domestic lives. It presents the idea that \"all you need are good friends\" and can construct families through choice. The audience is able to identify with the program through the troubles seen on weekly episodes. It portrays a new way of living life and developing relationships which are not normally seen in conventional society. According to a pop-culture expert at the University at Buffalo, Friends is \"one of those rare shows that marked a change in American culture.\" The images of youth and the roles they portray are better defined and represent a lifestyle that centres around creating and sustaining relationships between friends running their own lives and seeking help from each other.\nVox stated that Friends had an impact on the creation of other conflictless \"hangout sitcoms\", with groups of adult friends who are funny and have similar character traits. One example of this is How I Met Your Mother, which The Guardian's TV and radio blog notes also shares its setting with Friends, Manhattan. Other examples include The Big Bang Theory, New Girl, and Happy Endings.Readers of TV Guide voted the cast of Friends their Best Comedy cast of all time, ranking at 29% of the votes, beating Seinfeld, which registered 18%. A poll undertaken by 60 Minutes and Vanity Fair named Friends the third-greatest sitcom of all time. In 2014, the series was ranked by Mundo Estranho the Best TV Series of All Time. A 2015 survey by The Hollywood Reporter of 2,800 actors, producers, directors, and other industry people named Friends as their No. 1 favorite show.", "hasanswer": false}]}

As Valentin explained in November 1991:\n\nWhen I started listening to bands that weren't on Top 40 radio, I realized there could be music I liked that isn't really polished and shiny... There was this whole other world where people who just like music could just start a band and just play. You didn't have to be great. You could make up for technical talent with energy and directness. It was the realization that 'Hey, I can do this.'\nThey began selling their first album Toreador Squat on cassette and playing clubs in the Midwest.  The following year, the band recorded songs with producer Iain Burgess, followed by five more songs produced with Steve Albini: the resulting album Flower Plower was released in 1989 on the Limited Potential label.  It was also at this time that Poster Children picked up a second guitarist in order to complete their four-piece configuration.\nA major label record deal was signed with Warner Bros. Records subsidiary Reprise Records. Over the next few albums, Poster Children would be shuffled from imprint to imprint within the Warner organization. Tracks for Daisychain Reaction were recorded by Steve Albini at the Chicago Recording Company in 1990, but due to financial difficulties at the label, the album was not released until the following year. The album included Hum bassist Jeff Dimpsey on guitar.\nIn 1991 Rick's brother, Jim, replaced Dimpsey, and remains to this day. Tool of the Man was recorded in 1992 at Dreamland Studio in New York with John Herndon (celebrated Tortoise percussionist) on drums. Tool of the Man was also released in the UK on the Creation label.  The track \"Clock Street\" was picked as their only UK single to date. Just Like You and Junior Citizen followed, with modest but consistent sales.  Matt Friscia auditioned for the band in 1993 as a high school student willing to drop out to go on tour, but the band didn't want to contribute to his delinquency, and hired Howie Kantoff instead.  Friscia was available again in 2001 when the band was searching for its seventh (and current) drummer.\nThe band was on the second stage for Lollapalooza in 1995.\nRick Valentin and Rose Marshack are married and have hosted the long running podcast Radio Zero since 1999.

He met with Wilson and Parks circa June 1966 and was given lyric sheets of their songs, for which he based his drawings on. By Holmes' recollection, his contributions were finished by October. The pieces were titled:\n\nHolmes based the cover on an abandoned jewelry store near his home in Pasadena. He recalled, \"I thought that was a good image because of the way, any time you go into a store, you're entering something [...] This was something that would be pulling you into the world of Smile\u2013the Smile Shoppe\u2013and it had these little smiles all around.\" Depicted inside the shop is \"a husband and wife\u2014a kind of early-Americana, old-style, 19th-century kind of image.\" Wilson approved the cover and took it to Capitol. Parks later said that the illustrations heavily informed the making of Smile and considered them to be the album's \"third equation\". He felt that he and Wilson would not have continued the project the way they did without thinking of it in cartoon terms.According to Vosse, the smile shop derived from Wilson's humor concept. He said that \"everybody who knew anything about graphics, and about art, thought that the cover was not terribly well done [...] but Brian knew better; he was right. It was exactly what he wanted, precisely what he wanted.\" Parks recalled: \"Frank was supposed to do something 'light-hearted', but there were no specific instructions and he came up with the perfect video vessel for realizing what we were doing, something I thought was an integral part of the situation. I think that still stands; I think of Smile in visual terms.\nIn September, Capitol began production on a lavish gatefold cover with a 12-page booklet containing featuring color photographs of the group (ultimately selected from a November 7 photoshoot in Boston conducted by Guy Webster as well as Holmes' illustrations). In early 1967, they added the repeated written instances of \"Good Vibrations\" on the album cover, which were not featured on Holmes' original design.

{"id": "162_207", "question": "Who was the producer of \"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\"?", "ctxs": [{"id": "162_68665", "text": "The album represents a break from the recording methods of Young's work with Buffalo Springfield and his debut album, in which layers of overdubs are used to create each track. Instead, the songs on the album were largely recorded live, without overdubs. Young explains to DJ B. Mitchell Reid: \"That\u2019s when a change came over me, right then. I started just tryin' to be real instead of fabricate something. Since then I've just been striving to get realer and realer on record. As in more real.\" For the first time, Young would record his vocal live while playing. \"My only concern was to make the fuckin' records sound right. When I finally got the studio together and played, I think, \"Running Dry,\" that was my first live vocal.\"\nIn a 1970 interview for Rolling Stone's Elliot Blinder, Young says that he was trying to achieve a sound on the record reminiscent of 1950s and 1960s singles where the singer and band achieve a tight, locked-in sound together: \"I'm trying to make records of the quality of the records that were made in the late Fifties and the Sixties, like Everly Brothers records and Roy Orbison records and things like that. They were all done with a sort of quality to them. They were done at once. It's just a quality about them, the singer is into the song and the musicians were playing with the singer and it was an entity, you know. It was something special that used to hit me all the time, that all these people were thinking the same thing, and they're all playing at the same time. It happens on a few cuts, you can hear it. I think \"Cinnamon Girl,\" \"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere,\" and \"Round And Round\" has that feeling of togetherness, although it was just Danny and me and Robin Lane.\"\nYoung enlisted David Briggs to produce the record. Young first collaborated with Briggs during the recording of his debut album. The first sessions for the album were held in late January 1969 at Wally Heider Studios in Hollywood, where the band cut \"Down by the River,\" \"Cowgirl in the Sand\" and \"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere.\"\n\"Down by the River\" and \"Cowgirl in the Sand\" are edited from extended performances, and in some cases combine multiple takes. Young explains that three of four takes of each song were recorded in a 2009 interview for Guitar World Magazine: \"You know, maybe what you hear on the record would be take one, but with a couple pieces of something else in there. I could look it up. We have all the track sheets. All that information could be made available through Archives updates. We could make it so you could go in and figure out exactly what take you're listening to of a specific song. He continues in Shakey: \"'Down by the River' was really edited. We got the vibe, but it was just too long and sometimes it fell apart, so we just took the shitty parts out. Made some radical cuts in there; I mean, you can hear 'em. But Danny just played so cool on that. He made the whole band sound good. Me and Billy and Ralph sounded like Crazy Horse right away. All I had to do was come up with the songs and the riffs. I started realizing how long we could jam. It was fantastic.\"Young's lead vocal track on the song \"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\" (on the original album) was actually a temporary scratch vocal he sang through the low-quality talk-back microphone on the mixing board, with no effects such as reverb. Young liked the stark contrast to the rest of the recording.\nThe group would take a break in recording from the end of January until late March. Young would perform a series of solo acoustic sets at Le Hibou Coffee House in Ottawa and at the Riverboat Coffee House in Toronto. The Riverboat concerts would see release in 2009 as Live at the Riverboat 1969. Crazy Horse would then join Young for additional dates at coffeehouse folk clubs in late February through March. Young would perform a solo acoustic set followed by a band set, performing at The Bitter End in New York, in Cleveland, Providence, and at the Troubadour in Hollywood.The band would return to Wally Heider on March 20 and record \"Cinnamon Girl,\" \"Losing End\" and \"Running Dry\". \"Cinnamon Girl\" features handclaps, inspired by the 1963 single \"My Boyfriend's Back\" by The Angels. An early single mix of the song features the vocals of Danny Whitten more prominently, with both singers equal in the mix. Young changed the mix for the album, a decision he regrets: \"I have made an Early Daze record of the Horse, and you can hear a different vocal of \"Cinnamon Girl\" featuring more of Danny. He was singing the high part, and it came through big-time. I changed it so I sang the high part and put that out. That was a big mistake. I fucked up. I did not know who Danny was. He was better than me. I didn't see it. I was strong, and maybe I helped destroy something sacred by not seeing it. He was never pissed off about it. It wasn't like that. I was young, and maybe I didn't know what I was doing. Some things you wish never happened. But we got what we got.\"\"Cinnamon Girl\" is noted for its one-note guitar solo. According to Young, \"people say that it is a solo with only one note but, in my head, each one of those notes is different. The more you get into it, the more you can hear the differences.\u201d He elaborates in a 1991 interview: \"The same note on two strings. The wang bar made every one sound different. When people say 'one-note solo,' I listen to it and every one sounds different to me. It sounds like it's all different in that one place. As you're going in farther, you\u2019re hearing all the differences, but if you get back, it's all one.\"On March 23, the band convened with singer Robin Lane at Sunwest Recording Studio in Hollywood to record the final song for the album. \"Round and Round\" was performed live in the studio for the album to achieve a more authentic sound. Young would explain in an April 1970 interview for Rolling Stone: \"There were three people sitting like you and me, and then another, and six microphone booms coming down, absolutely stoned out of our minds in the studio, singing a song with the guitars, three guitars goin' at once. If you listen to it, \"Round And Round\" is one of my favorites on the second album, because ... the echo from the acoustic guitar on the right echoes back on the left, and the echo from the guitar on the left comes back on the right and it makes the guitars go like this: one line starts goin' like da-da-daow, and then you can hear like one voice comes in and out, and that's 'cause Danny was rockin' back and forth. Those things are not featured, they're just in it, you know, and that's what I'm trying to get at. I think they last longer that way. Doing it live and singing and playing all at once just makes it sound more real.\" Singer Robin Lane was caught off guard that her performance on the song became the master take. \"I thought we were rehearsing. I didn\u2019t even know what I was singing. Neil was the original punk rocker.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

In the US, it was first released on videotape and CED in the early 1980s by Wizard Video and Vestron Video. The British Board of Film Classification had long since refused a certification for the uncut theatrical version and in 1984 they also refused to certify it for home video, amid a moral panic surrounding \"video nasties\". After the retirement of BBFC Director James Ferman in 1999, the board passed the film uncut for theatrical and video distribution with an 18 certificate, almost 25 years after the original release. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was released on LaserDisc in the United States in November 1993. It was initially released on DVD in October 1998 in the United States, May 2000 in the United Kingdom and 2001 in Australia.\nIn 2005 the film received a 2K scan and full restoration from the original 16mm A/B rolls, which was subsequently released on DVD and Blu-ray. In 2014, a more extensive 4K restoration, supervised by Hooper, using the original 16mm A/B reversal rolls, was carried out. After a screening in the Directors' Fortnight section of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, this was also released on DVD and Blu-ray worldwide. Dark Sky Films' US 40th Anniversary Edition was nominated for Best DVD/BD Special Edition Release at the 2015 Saturn Awards.In 1982, shortly after The Texas Chain Saw Massacre established itself as a success on US home video, Wizard Video released a mass-market video game adaptation for the Atari 2600. In the game, the player assumes the role of Leatherface and attempts to murder trespassers while avoiding obstacles such as fences and cow skulls. As one of the first horror-themed video games, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre caused controversy when it was first released due to its violent nature; it sold poorly as a result, because many game stores refused to stock it.The film has been followed by eight other films to date, including sequels, prequels and remakes. The first sequel, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986), was considerably more graphic and violent than the original and was banned in Australia for 20 years before it was released on DVD in a revised special edition in October 2006. Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III (1990) was the second sequel to appear, though Hooper did not return to direct due to scheduling conflicts with another film, Spontaneous Combustion. Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation, starring Ren\u00e9e Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey, was released in 1995. While briefly acknowledging the events of the preceding two sequels, its plot makes it a virtual remake of the 1974 original. A straight remake, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, was released by Platinum Dunes and New Line Cinema in 2003. It was followed by a prequel, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, in 2006. A seventh film, Texas Chainsaw 3D, was released on January 4, 2013. It is a direct sequel to the original 1974 film, with no relation to the previous sequels, or the 2003 remake. Another prequel, Leatherface, was released exclusively to DirecTV on September 21, 2017, before receiving a wider release on video on demand and in limited theaters, simultaneously, in North America on October 20, 2017.

Wings at the Speed of Sound sold 3.5 million copies worldwide.Much of the album's success can be attributed to its two smash singles: \"Silly Love Songs\", a response to his critics, which became one of 1976's biggest-selling singles, followed by \"Let 'Em In\", which also scaled the singles charts.

Whedon served as executive producer and showrunner under his production tag Mutant Enemy Productions.\nThe series premiered on March 10, 1997, on The WB and concluded on May 20, 2003, on UPN. The series follows Buffy Summers (played by Sarah Michelle Gellar), the latest in a succession of young women known as \"Vampire Slayers\", or simply \"Slayers\". In the story, Slayers, or the \"Chosen Ones\", are chosen by fate to battle against vampires, demons and other forces of darkness. Buffy wants to live a normal life, but as the series progresses, she learns to embrace her destiny. Like previous Slayers, Buffy is aided by a Watcher, who guides, teaches and trains her. Unlike her predecessors, Buffy surrounds herself with a circle of loyal friends who become known as the \"Scooby Gang\" \u2013 a reference to the animated franchise Scooby-Doo that features a group of friends solving mysteries together.\nThe series received critical and popular acclaim, and is often listed among the greatest television series of all time. Original airings often reached four to six million viewers. Although lower than successful shows on the \"big four\" networks (ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox), these ratings were a success for the relatively new and smaller WB Television Network.

The series has received attention in fandom (including fan films), parody, and academia, and has influenced the direction of other television series. Buffy was part of a wave of television series from the late 1990s and early 2000s that featured strong female characters, alongside Charmed, Xena: Warrior Princess, La Femme Nikita, Dark Angel, and Alias.

He returns to the funeral and hides the body inside his mother's coffin, only to realize later that the man's cell phone is still in the coffin. A few days later, to Ko and his squad's relief, the internal affairs' investigation is cancelled by a lieutenant named Park.\nKo's squad is then assigned to locate and arrest a wanted murderer named Lee, who Ko recognizes as the homeless man. While searching Lee's hideout, the squad meets a police officer who is investigating a hit-and-run incident. Lee's hideout is right next to the site of the collision, in view of a traffic camera.

The working title was inspired by a series of performance the Mothers of Invention held at the Fillmore Auditorium, finishing a day prior to the recording session. Zappa would then inaugurate a three-day recording stint at Capital Studios to record Lumpy Gravy from March 14-16, 1967. The band returned to New York in the following week, where Zappa became acquainted to then Cream guitarist Eric Clapton during an acoustic guitar led jam at his home. The band subsequently spent from April to June rehearsing and gigging locally in support of their previous album Absolutely Free, which released on May 26, 1967. Popular contemporaries such as guitarist Jimi Hendrix, and singer-songwriter Essra Mohawk, joined the Mothers of Invention during their New York shows.\nIn July, band member Ray Collins had left the Mothers before the New York recording sessions took place, but later rejoined when the band was recording the doo-wop songs that formed the album Cruisin' with Ruben & the Jets. Gary Kellgren was hired as an engineer for the project, and subsequently wound up delivering whispered pieces of dialogue that linked segments of We're Only in It for the Money. During the recording sessions, Verve requested that Zappa remove a verse from the song \"Mother People\". Zappa complied, but reversed the recording and included the backwards verse as part of the dialogue track \"Hot Poop\", concluding the album's first side, but this would be removed by Verve themselves on subsequent represses of their own. Also censored on all copies was the Lenny Bruce reference in \"Harry, You're A Beast\", and a spoken segment of \"Concentration Moon\" in which Kellgren called the Velvet Underground \"as shitty a group as Frank Zappa's group\".Primary recording sessions ran from July until September 1967 at Mayfair Studios in New York. During this period of work on the album, the band recorded at a continuous rate, only taking breaks on the weekends. While the Jimi Hendrix Experience occupied Mayfair Studios on July 19 and 20, to record \"The Stars That Play with Laughing Sam's Dice\", the band worked on and executed ideas for the cover art for We're Only in it for the Money. Hendrix would make an appearance in the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band mock cover, blending in with the cardboard cutouts of other major figures.  Weekday work was only halted again on August 4, when Bob Dylan booked the studio to mix and press an acetate disc of \"Too Much Of Nothing\". A majority of the basic tracks would be finished in August, and September was spent mostly overdubbing onto the basic recordings. On September 4, the Velvet Underground, who the Mothers of Invention then detested, entered the studio's second recording space with Tom Wilson, the band's previous producer, to record their sophomore album, White Light/White Heat. Both bands did however co-operate in the studio, and Zappa even suggested to Velvet Underground front-man Lou Reed that he record himself stabbing a cantaloupe with a wrench in the band's song \"The Gift\". The Mothers of Invention halted work on September 22 to pursue what is considered to be their first European tour, before returning to Apostolic Studios, also in New York, from October 3-8 in order to finish the album off, with final overdubs and mixing occurring.While recording We're Only in It for the Money, Zappa discovered that the strings of Apostolic Studios' grand piano would resonate if a person spoke near those strings. The \"piano people\" experiment involved Zappa having various speakers improvise dialogue using topics offered by Zappa. Various people contributed to these sessions, including Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart and Tim Buckley, who Zappa became familiar with after a concert in December 1966. The \"piano people\" voices primarily consisted of Motorhead Sherwood, Roy Estrada, Spider Barbour, All-Night John (the manager of the studio) and Louis Cuneo, who was noted for his laugh, which sounded like a \"psychotic turkey\".\n\nDuring the production, Zappa experimented with recording and editing techniques which produced unusual textures and musique concr\u00e8te compositions; the album featured abbreviated songs interrupted by segments of dialogue and unrelated music which changed the continuity of the album. Segments of orchestral music included on the album came from a solo orchestral album by Zappa previously released by Capitol Records under the title Lumpy Gravy in 1967. MGM claimed that Zappa was under contractual obligation to record for them, and subsequently Zappa re-edited Lumpy Gravy, releasing a drastically different version on Verve Records, after the release of We're Only in It for the Money. The artwork of Lumpy Gravy identified it as \"phase 2 of We're Only in It for the Money\", while We're Only in It for the Money was identified in its artwork as \"phase one of Lumpy Gravy\", alluding to the conceptual continuity of the two albums.For some pressings of the album, MGM censored several tracks without Zappa's knowledge, involvement or permission. On the song \"Absolutely Free\", the line \"I don't do publicity balling for you anymore\" was edited by MGM to remove the word \"balling\", changing the meaning of the sentence. Additionally, on \"Let's Make the Water Turn Black\", the line \"and I still remember Mama, with her apron and her pad, feeding all the boys at Ed's Cafe\" was removed. Zappa later learned that this line was censored because an MGM executive thought that the word \"pad\" referred to a sanitary napkin, rather than a waitress's order pad. The Kellgren dialogue segment in \"Concentration Moon\" was also re-edited, making it seem that he was calling the Velvet Underground \"Frank Zappa's group.\" Zappa later declined to accept an award for the album upon being made aware of the censorship, stating \"I prefer that the award be presented to the guy who modified this record, because what you're hearing is more reflective of his work than mine.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Their late father was a pastor who founded his own Pietistic conventicle. Lacking new converts, the aging sisters preside over a dwindling, elderly congregation.\nForty-nine years before, the sisters have many suitors, but their father rejects them, as he wishes to retain the assistance of the women to further his pastoral mission. Martine is courted by a young Swedish cavalry officer, Lorens L\u00f6wenhielm, who is visiting Jutland. Filippa is courted by a famous baritone Achille Papin, from the Paris Opera, who is currently on hiatus. Both sisters decide to spurn their suitors and stay with their father.\nThirty-five years later, Babette Hersant appears at their door. She carries a letter from Papin which explains that she is a refugee from counter-revolutionary bloodshed in Paris and recommends her as a housekeeper. The sisters cannot afford to employ Babette, but she begs to work for free. Babette serves as their cook for the next fourteen years, producing improved versions of the bland meals typical of the abstemious nature of the congregation and gaining their respect, and that of the other locals. As the years go by, the sisters are deeply distressed by the increasing number of disputes between the congregants. Babette is also troubled, and at one point, interrupts the arguments with a stern rebuke.\nBabette's only link to her former life is a lottery ticket. A Parisian friend annually renews the ticket. One day, she wins the lottery and receives 10,000 francs. After her win she decides to prepare a dinner for the sisters and their small congregation on the occasion of the founding pastor's hundredth birthday. More than just a feast, the meal is an outpouring of Babette's appreciation, an act of self-sacrifice.\nThe sisters accept both Babette's meal and her offer to pay for the creation of a \"real French dinner.\" Babette arranges for her nephew to go to Paris and gather the supplies for the feast. The ingredients are plentiful, sumptuous and exotic, and their arrival causes much consternation and discussion among the villagers. As the various never-before-seen ingredients arrive and preparations commence, the sisters begin to worry that the meal will become a sin of sensual luxury, if not some form of devilry. In a hasty conference, the sisters and the congregation agree to eat the meal, but to forgo speaking of any pleasure in it and to make no mention of the food during the dinner.\nMartine's former suitor, Lorens, now a famous general married to a member of the Queen's court, comes as the guest of his aunt, the local lady of the manor and a member of the old pastor's congregation. He is unaware of the other guests' austere plans and as a man of the world and former attach\u00e9 in Paris, he is the only person at the table qualified to comment on the meal. He regales the guests with abundant information about the extraordinary food and drink, comparing it to a meal he enjoyed years earlier at the famous Caf\u00e9 Anglais in Paris. Although the other celebrants refuse to comment on the earthly pleasures of their meal, Babette's gifts break down their distrust and superstitions, elevating them physically and spiritually. Old wrongs are forgiven, ancient loves are rekindled and a mystical redemption of the human spirit settles over the table.\nBereft, the sisters assume that Babette will return to Paris. However, when she says that all of her money is gone and that she is not going anywhere, the sisters are aghast. Babette then reveals that she was formerly the head chef of the Caf\u00e9 Anglais, where a dinner for twelve cost 10,000 francs. Martine tearfully says, \"Now you will be poor the rest of your life\", to which Babette replies, \"An artist is never poor.\" Filippa then says: \"But this is not the end, Babette.

It is loosely based on the 1837 Danish fairy tale of the same name by Hans Christian Andersen. The film was written and directed by John Musker and Ron Clements and produced by Musker and Howard Ashman, who also wrote the film's songs with Alan Menken. Menken also composed the film's score. Featuring the voices of Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Jodi Benson, Pat Carroll, Paddi Edwards, Buddy Hackett, Jason Marin, Kenneth Mars, Ben Wright and Samuel E. Wright, The Little Mermaid tells the story of a teenage mermaid princess named Ariel, who dreams of becoming human and falls in love with a human prince named Eric, which leads her to make a magic deal with the sea witch, Ursula, to become human and be with him.\nWalt Disney planned to put the story in a proposed package film containing Andersen's stories, but scrapped the project. In 1985, while working on The Great Mouse Detective (1986), Clements and Musker decided to adapt the fairy tale and proposed it to Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, who initially declined due to its similarities to a proposed sequel to the 1984 film Splash, but ultimately approved of it. Ashman became involved and brought in Menken. With supervision from Katzenberg, they made a Broadway-style structure with musical numbers as the staff was working on Oliver & Company (1988). Katzenberg warned that the film would earn less since it appealed to female viewers, but he eventually became convinced that it would be Disney's first blockbuster hit.\nThe Little Mermaid was released to theaters on November 17, 1989, to critical acclaim, earning praise for the animation, music, and characters. It was also a commercial success, garnering $84 million at the domestic box office during its initial release, and $235 million in total lifetime gross worldwide, becoming the sixth-highest-grossing film of 1989. Along with the major success of both Disney's 1986 animated film The Great Mouse Detective and the 1988 Disney/Amblin live-action/animated film Who Framed Roger Rabbit, The Little Mermaid is given credit for breathing life back into the art of Disney animated feature films after some films produced by Disney were struggling. It also marked the start of the era known as the Disney Renaissance. The film won two Academy Awards for Best Original Score and Best Original Song (\"Under the Sea\").\nThe film's success led to a media franchise. A direct-to-video sequel was released in 2000, focusing on Ariel's daughter, Melody. A prequel followed in 2008. The first film was adapted into a stage musical with a book by Doug Wright and additional songs by Alan Menken and new lyricist Glenn Slater opened in Denver in July 2007 and began performances on Broadway January 10, 2008 starring Sierra Boggess.Other derived works and material inspired by the film, include a 2019 live musical presentation on ABC as part of The Wonderful World of Disney, and a 2023 live-action film adaptation directed by Rob Marshall and starring Halle Bailey.\nIn 2022, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".", "hasanswer": true}]}

Featuring the voices of Mary Costa, Bill Shirley, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton, Barbara Luddy, Barbara Jo Allen, Taylor Holmes, and Bill Thompson, the film follows Princess Aurora, who was cursed by the evil fairy Maleficent to die from a prick from the spindle of a spinning wheel. She is saved by three good fairies, who alter the curse so that the princess falls into a deep sleep and is awakened by true love's kiss.\nSleeping Beauty began development in 1950. The film took nearly a decade and $6 million to produce, and was Disney's most expensive animated feature at the time. Its tapestry-like art style was devised by Eyvind Earle, who was inspired by pre-Renaissance European art; its score and songs, composed by George Bruns, was based on Pyotr Tchaikovsky's 1889 ballet. Sleeping Beauty was the first animated film to use the Super Technirama 70 widescreen process and was the second full-length animated feature filmed in anamorphic widescreen, following Lady and the Tramp (1955).It was released in theaters on January 29, 1959, to mixed reviews from critics who praised its art direction and musical score and criticized its plot and characters. The film was a box-office bomb in its initial release, grossing $5.3 million, and losing $900,000 for the distributor and many employees from the animation studio became layoffs. Sleeping Beauty's re-releases have been successful, and it has become one of Disney's most artistically acclaimed features. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Scoring of a Musical Picture at the 32nd Academy Awards.\nMaleficent, a live-action reimagining of the film from Maleficent's perspective, was released in 2014, followed by a sequel, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, in 2019. The latter year, Sleeping Beauty was selected for preservation in the United States Library of Congress' National Film Registry as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".", "hasanswer": true}]}

It retells the folktale \"Little Red Riding Hood\" as a police procedural, using backstories to show multiple characters' points of view. It was produced independently by Blue Yonder Films with Kanbar Entertainment, directed and written by Cory Edwards along with Todd Edwards, and Tony Leech, and produced by Katie Hooten, Maurice Kanbar, David K. Lovegren, Sue Bea Montgomery, and Preston Stutzman. The film features the voices of Anne Hathaway, Glenn Close, Jim Belushi, Patrick Warburton, Anthony Anderson, David Ogden Stiers, Xzibit, Chazz Palminteri, and Andy Dick.\nHoodwinked! was among the earliest computer-animated films to be completely independently funded. Working apart from a major studio allowed the filmmakers greater creative control, but also restrained them economically. Due to the film's low budget, its animation was produced in the Philippines with a stylized design inspired by stop motion films. The Weinstein Company did not sign on as the film's distributor until near the end of production, and while the company had several roles recast with higher-profile actors, it otherwise made few changes to the film. Structurally, the film was inspired by non-linear crime dramas, such as Rashomon and Pulp Fiction. It was released shortly after the first two installments in the successful Shrek series, which accentuated the fairy tale parody genre of which Hoodwinked! is a part. Hoodwinked!, however, intentionally deviated from the Shrek series in its style of humor and in certain plot elements. This was in part based on Cory Edwards' concerns over exposing children to the high level of cynicism often found in the genre.\nThe film was released by the Weinstein Company in Los Angeles, California, and Philadelphia on December 16, 2005, for a one-week engagement before expanding nationwide on January 13, 2006. Critical reception to the film was varied; although its script and voice performances were praised by many reviews, its animation quality was heavily criticized. The film was a commercial success, earning over thirteen times its less-than-$8 million budget. A sequel, Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil, was released in 2011 to negative reviews and failed to match the financial success of the first film.", "hasanswer": true}]}

We've been in the studio with Rick Rubin, working on a couple of things, and we're going to be recording during most of next year.\" In an interview with Classic Rock on January 8, 2013, Lars Ulrich said regarding the album, \"What we're doing now certainly sounds like a continuation [of Death Magnetic]\". He also said, \"I love Rick [Rubin]. We all love Rick. We're in touch with Rick constantly. We'll see where it goes. It would stun me if the record came out in 2013.\" In a July 2013 interview, Ulrich told Ultimate Guitar, \"2014 will be all about making a new Metallica record\"; he said the album would most likely be released during 2015. Trujillo and Kirk Hammett later confirmed the band's intention to enter the studio.In March 2014, Metallica began a tour called \"Metallica By Request\", in which fans requested songs for the band to perform, and a new song, titled \"Lords of Summer\", was written for the concerts and released as a \"first take\" demo in March 2014. A Black Friday exclusive single featuring the \"First Pass Version\" and a live version limited to 4,000 copies was released later that year on vinyl. In March 2015, Ulrich told Rolling Stone that twenty songs had been written for the album, and that he hoped some of them could be played at their shows later in the year. In October 2015, the band unveiled a new website with an introduction from Ulrich containing footage from the studio of the band working on new material. In November, Hammett said that the album was expected to be released in late 2016 or early 2017.On February 6, 2016, during their \"The Night Before\" show at AT&T Park prior to Super Bowl 50, James Hetfield said that the band was nearing the end of the recording process, and Ulrich said that the album would be released soon. This was compounded by the band playing a new riff at the show, which ended up being from the song \"Murder One\". Ulrich further elaborated in March 2016 when he said that the band hoped to finish production of the album during the spring. \"I think [2016] will be a pretty in-your-face year, at least the back half of it... hopefully we should be able to knock that on the head (finishing the album) this spring, I would guess\". In March 2016, Hammett said that the band had worked with Greg Fidelman, who engineered and mixed Death Magnetic, as producer on the new album. \"The title 'producer' itself is a bit ambiguous. It differs from person to person. You can call Rick Rubin a producer, but he's not the [same] type of producer as Bob Rock, who is there for every note. At the same time, Rick Rubin gets stuff done. Greg Fidelman is a different type of producer in that he's with the engineer always looking to try and move the project forward.\"In April 2016, during the week leading up to Record Store Day, for which the band was its ambassador for 2016, Ulrich told Billboard that the band's expanded role within the music industry had played a part in the amount of time that it had taken to write and record the album. \"The way we do things now is very different than the way we did things back in the days of Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning. Nowadays we like to do so many different things.\" Ulrich was also optimistic that production of the album had almost reached its completion. \"Unless something radical happens it would be difficult for me to believe that it won't come out in 2016.\" In May 2016, Ulrich said in an interview with Metal Forces that the album would be released in the summer of 2016, and that details for the new album would be finalized in the next month. \"If the record doesn't come out this year then it won't be because it's not done... it will be because there's some sort of cosmic reason that it would be smarter to hold onto it until next year.

The story takes place in Clairton, Pennsylvania, a working-class town on the Monongahela River south of Pittsburgh, and in Vietnam.\nThe film was based in part on an unproduced screenplay called \"The Man Who Came to Play,\" by Louis A. Garfinkle and Quinn K. Redeker, about Las Vegas and Russian roulette. Producer Michael Deeley, who bought the script, hired writer/director Michael Cimino who, with Deric Washburn, rewrote the script, taking the Russian roulette element and placing it in the Vietnam War.

Its producers EMI Films released it internationally, while Universal Pictures handled its North American distribution.\nThe Deer Hunter received acclaim from critics and audiences, with praise for Cimino's direction, the performances of its cast (particularly De Niro, Walken, Cazale and Streep), and its screenplay, realistic themes and tones, and cinematography. It was also successful at the box office, grossing $49 million.

Snow White soon learns that the cottage is the home of seven dwarfs named Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey, who work in a nearby mine. Returning home, they are alarmed to find their cottage clean, and suspect that an intruder has invaded their home. Snow White introduces herself, and the dwarfs welcome her after she offers to clean and cook for them. Snow White keeps house for the dwarfs while they mine for jewels during the day; and at night, they all sing, play music, and dance.\nBack at the castle, the Magic Mirror reveals that Snow White is still living, and with the dwarfs. Enraged that the Huntsman tricked her, the Queen creates a poisoned apple that will put whoever eats it into a death-like sleep. She learns the curse can be broken by \"love's first kiss,\" but is certain Snow White will be buried alive before this can happen. Using a potion to disguise herself as an old hag, the Queen goes to the cottage while the dwarfs are away. The animals see through the disguise, but are unable to warn Snow White; they rush off to find the dwarfs. The Queen fools Snow White into biting into the apple, and she falls into a death-like slumber.\nThe dwarfs return with the animals as the Queen leaves the cottage, and give chase, trapping her on a cliff. She tries to roll a boulder onto them, but lightning strikes the cliff before she can do so, causing her to fall and get crushed to death by the boulder. In their cottage, the dwarfs find Snow White asleep by the poison. Unwilling to bury her in the ground, they instead place her in a glass coffin in the forest. Together with the animals, they keep watch over her.\nThe following spring, the prince learns of Snow White's eternal sleep and visits the coffin. Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, which breaks the spell and awakens her. The dwarfs and animals all rejoice as the prince takes Snow White to his castle.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was released on June 25, 1984, by Warner Bros. Records as the soundtrack album to the 1984 film of the same name. Purple Rain was musically denser than Prince's previous albums, emphasizing full band performances, and multiple layers of guitars, keyboards, electronic synthesizer effects, drum machines, and other instruments.\nMuch of the album had a grandiose, synthesized, and psychedelic sheen to the production and performances. The music on Purple Rain is generally regarded as the most pop-oriented of Prince's career, though a number of elements point towards the more experimental records Prince would release after Purple Rain. The music video for the album's lead single \"When Doves Cry\" sparked controversy among network executives, who thought its sexual nature was too explicit for television. The risqu\u00e9 lyrics of \"Darling Nikki\" raised complaints from Tipper Gore and the Parents Music Resource Center and contributed to the implementation of Parental Advisory stickers and imprints on album covers.\nPurple Rain became Prince's first album to reach number one on the Billboard 200. The album spent 24 consecutive weeks atop on the Billboard 200 and was present on the chart for a total of 167 weeks. \"When Doves Cry\" and \"Let's Go Crazy\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, while \"Purple Rain\" peaked at number two and \"I Would Die 4 U\" peaked at number eight. In May 1996, the album was certified 13\u00d7 Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It is Prince's commercial peak, with total sales standing at 25 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. Prince and the Revolution won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media, while Prince also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for the film Purple Rain.\nMusic critics noted the innovative and experimental aspects of the soundtrack's music, most famously on the spare, bass-less \"When Doves Cry\". Other aspects of the music, especially its synthesis of electronic elements with organic instrumentation and full-band performances along with its consolidation of rock and R&B, were identified by critics as distinguishing, even experimental factors. Purple Rain is regularly ranked among the greatest albums of all time. Rolling Stone ranked the album number 8 on its 2020 list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and added to the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry list of sound recordings that are \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".", "hasanswer": true}]}

It was a \"hit psychedelic album\", Richie Unterberger later wrote, and by mid-November, it had reached number one in the US, spending two weeks atop the pop charts. The double LP was the Experience's most commercially successful release and Hendrix's only number-one album. In the UK, it peaked at number six and charted for 12 weeks.Electric Ladyland confounded contemporary critics; reviewers praised some of its songs but felt the album lacked structure and sounded too dense. Melody Maker called it \"mixed-up and muddled\", with the exception of \"All Along the Watchtower\", which the magazine called a masterpiece. Reviewing for Rolling Stone in 1968, Tony Glover said Hendrix's original songs sometimes sound unstructured and was somewhat disappointed by the \"heavy handed guitar\" on \"1983... (A Merman I Should Turn to Be)\" and the science-fiction conclusion to \"House Burning Down\". Ultimately, Glover appreciated the \"energy flow\" unifying the songs and described Hendrix as \"amazing\", adding that Electric Ladyland serves as \"an extended look into Hendrix's head, and mostly it seems to have some pretty good things in it (who among us is totally free of mental garbage?)\". Robert Christgau was more enthusiastic in Stereo Review, regarding it as an explosive showcase of rock's \"most important recent innovation\"\u2014the \"heavy\" guitar aesthetic\u2014and \"an integrated work-in-itself in more ways than one\". He found the production exceptional\u2014\"the best job of stereo for its own sake I know\"\u2014and was surprisingly impressed by the quality of the lyrics. While most guitarists in rock believed improvisation to be a straightforward endeavor, Christgau said \"Hendrix achieves unique effects, effects you'll never get from Kenny Burrell\", citing \"Voodoo Chile\" as an example. He later named Electric Ladyland the fifth-best album of 1968 in his ballot for Jazz & Pop magazine's critics poll.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Both Homer's mother and Herb Powell make their first appearances on The Simpsons in the episode.\nThe episode was recorded on August 13, 1990. The voice of Herb was provided by guest star Danny DeVito, who was suggested for the role by Simpsons executive producer Sam Simon. Bart's voice actor, Nancy Cartwright, writes in her autobiography My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy that DeVito had to record his lines quickly because he had another appointment, so the staff focused on recording only his scenes instead of the whole episode at once. Cartwright was a fan of DeVito's and recalls: \"This morning, at the table read, I had just filled my plate with assorted fruits when Bonnie said to my backside, 'Nancy, I want to introduce you to ...' and I turned and practically knocked over Danny DeVito, all four feet, eleven inches of him. How embarrassing!\" While recording the scenes, Cartwright stood directly across the room from DeVito, which she appreciated since she got to see him in action. She thought DeVito \"threw his body and soul\" into his performance. While the recording took part, animation director Archer scribbled down some of DeVito's attitudes, gestures, and facial expressions on a piece of paper as he performed. In one scene of the episode, Herb tells Homer and the rest of the Simpson family to \"[make] yourselves at home. We have a tennis court, a swimming pool, a screening room ...\" Cartwright said of it:\n\nThis was obviously written with Danny in mind as I have no doubt that he actually has the aforementioned amenities in real life. He has earned his right to stand tall, and it wouldn't have shocked me to see him spew attitude all over us if he wanted to. But he's a hard worker and he concentrated on the job [...] As the episode came to its climax, we discovered that all the material things in the world don't mean as much to Herb as being with family. Somehow I just get the feeling that this part was tailor-made with Danny, the family man, in mind.\nSome fans were upset with the sad ending of the episode, and as a result the producers decided to write a sequel in which Herb would be given a kinder fate. The resulting episode, \"Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?\", aired at the end of the third season. In that episode, Herb briefly settled in the Simpson household, despite his intense continuing antipathy toward Homer. Homer loaned Herb US$2000, which Herb used to build an invention that translated infantile speech into comprehensible English, based on observations he made of Maggie. He proceeded to mass-produce his new product and regained his fortune.

It was erroneously reported by the news that he had been tied to a barbed wire fence. Many media reports contained the graphic account of the pistol-whipping and his fractured skull. Reports described how Shepard was beaten so brutally that his face was completely covered in blood, except where it had been partially cleansed by his tears.The assailants' girlfriends testified that neither McKinney nor Henderson was under the influence of alcohol or other drugs at the time of the attack. McKinney and Henderson testified that they learned of Shepard's address and intended to steal from his home as well.

McKinney proceeded to pick a fight with two men, 19-year-old Emiliano Morales and 18-year-old Jeremy Herrara. The fight resulted in head wounds for both Morales and McKinney.

It explores themes of death, occultism, and violence.\nThe album features the track \"Mechanix\", a song that frontman Dave Mustaine would perform with Metallica during his tenure in the band, and a controversial cover of the 1965 song \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\". A deluxe edition, completely remixed and remastered with several bonus tracks, was released through Loud Records on February 5, 2002. It features vastly different artwork, with its cover based on the version originally designed by Mustaine in 1985. All songs from the album were performed frequently during Megadeth's initial tour but have been steadily dropped from the setlist since, except for \"Mechanix\". A new remastered version of the album called Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! - The Final Kill was released on June 8, 2018, which includes a version of \"These Boots\" with re-recorded vocals, redone to Lee Hazlewood's version.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Christophe Beck was hired to compose the film's orchestral score, and Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez wrote the songs.\nAfter its world premiere at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on November 19, 2013, Frozen had its general theatrical release on November 27. The film was praised for its visuals, screenplay, themes, music, and voice acting, and some critics consider Frozen Disney's best animated film since the studio's Renaissance era.

Shore visited the set in 1999, and composed a version of the Shire theme and Frodo's Theme before Jackson began shooting. In August 2000 he visited the set again, and watched the assembly cuts of The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King. In the music, Shore included many (85 to 110) leitmotifs to represent various characters, cultures and places\u2014the largest catalogue of leitmotifs in the history of cinema, surpassing, for comparison, that of the entire Star Wars film series. For example, there are multiple leitmotifs just for the hobbits and the Shire. Although the first film had some of its score recorded in Wellington, virtually all of the trilogy's score was recorded in Watford Town Hall and mixed at Abbey Road Studios. Jackson planned to advise the score for six weeks each year in London, though for The Two Towers he stayed for twelve.The score is primarily played by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, ranging from 93 to 120 players throughout the recording. London Voices, the London Oratory School Schola boy choir, and many artists such as Ben Del Maestro, Sheila Chandra, Enya, Ren\u00e9e Fleming, James Galway, Annie Lennox and Emil\u00edana Torrini contributed. Even actors Billy Boyd, Viggo Mortensen, Liv Tyler, Miranda Otto (extended cuts only for the latter two) and Peter Jackson (for a single gong sound in the second film) contributed to the score. Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens served as librettists, writing lyrics to various music and songs, which David Salo translated into Tolkien's languages. The third film's end song, \"Into the West\", was a tribute to a young filmmaker Jackson and Walsh befriended named Cameron Duncan, who died of cancer in 2003.Shore composed a main theme for the Fellowship rather than many different character themes, and its strength and weaknesses in volume are depicted at different points in the series. On top of that, individual themes were composed to represent different cultures. Infamously, the amount of music Shore had to write every day for the third film increased dramatically to around seven minutes. The music for the series has been voted best movie soundtrack of all time for the six years running, passing Schindler's List (1993), Gladiator (2000), Star Wars (1977) and Out of Africa (1985), respectively.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The supporting cast is Will Sampson, Danny DeVito, Sydney Lassick, William Redfield, and the film debuts of Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif.  \nOriginally announced in 1962 with Kirk Douglas starring, the film took 13 years to develop. Filming finally began in January 1975 and lasted three months, on location in Salem, Oregon and the surrounding area, and in Depoe Bay on the north Oregon coast.

It consists of eight animated segments set to pieces of classical music conducted by Leopold Stokowski, seven of which are performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra. Music critic and composer Deems Taylor acts as the film's Master of Ceremonies who introduces each segment in live action.\nDisney settled on the film's concept in 1938 as work neared completion on The Sorcerer's Apprentice, originally an elaborate Silly Symphony cartoon designed as a comeback role for Mickey Mouse, who had declined in popularity. As production costs surpassed what the short could earn, Disney decided to include it in a feature-length film of multiple segments set to classical pieces with Stokowski and Taylor as collaborators. The soundtrack was recorded using multiple audio channels and reproduced with Fantasound, a pioneering sound system developed by Disney and RCA that made Fantasia the first commercial film shown in stereo and a precursor to surround sound.\nFantasia was first released as a theatrical roadshow that was held in 13 cities across the U.S. between 1940 and 1941 by RKO Radio Pictures; the first began at the Broadway Theatre in New York City on November 13, 1940. While acclaimed by critics, it failed to make a profit owing to World War II's cutting off distribution to the European market, the film's high production costs, and the expense of building Fantasound equipment and leasing theatres for the roadshow presentations. Since 1942, the film has been reissued multiple times by RKO Radio Pictures and Buena Vista Distribution with its original footage and audio being deleted, modified, or restored in each version. When adjusted for inflation, Fantasia is the 23rd highest-grossing film of all time in the U.S.\nThe Fantasia franchise has grown to include video games, Disneyland attractions, and a live concert series. A sequel, Fantasia 2000, co-produced by Walt's nephew Roy E. Disney, was released in 1999. Fantasia has grown in reputation over the years and is now widely acclaimed as one of the greatest animated films of all time; in 1998, the American Film Institute ranked it as the 58th greatest American film in their 100 Years...100 Movies and the fifth greatest animated film in their 10 Top 10 list.

The film was written and directed by Peter Berg, and stars Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster, and Eric Bana.\nUpon first learning of the book in 2007, Berg arranged several meetings with Luttrell to discuss adapting the book to film. Universal Pictures acquired the film rights in August 2007, after bidding against other major studios. In re-enacting events, Berg drew much of his screenplay from Luttrell's eyewitness accounts in the book, as well as autopsy and incident reports related to the mission. After directing Battleship (2012) for Universal, Berg resumed working on Lone Survivor. Principal photography began in October 2012 and concluded in November, after 42 days. Filming took place on location in New Mexico, using digital cinematography. Luttrell and several other Navy SEAL veterans acted as technical advisors, while multiple branches of the United States Armed Forces aided the production. Two companies, Industrial Light & Magic and Image Engine, created the visual effects.\nLone Survivor opened in limited release in the United States on December 25, 2013, before opening across North America on January 10, 2014.
