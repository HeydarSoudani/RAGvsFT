{"id": "50_1", "question": "Who was the author of the Manifesto of the Sixteen?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_18380", "text": "The Manifesto of the Sixteen (French: Manifeste des seize), or Proclamation of the Sixteen, was a document drafted in 1916 by eminent anarchists Peter Kropotkin and Jean Grave which advocated an Allied victory over Germany and the Central Powers during the First World War. At the outbreak of the war, Kropotkin and other anarchist supporters of the Allied cause advocated their position in the pages of the Freedom newspaper, provoking sharply critical responses. As the war continued, anarchists across Europe campaigned in anti-war movements and wrote denunciations of the war in pamphlets and statements, including one February 1916 statement signed by prominent anarchists such as Emma Goldman and Rudolf Rocker.\nAt this time, Kropotkin was in frequent correspondence with those who shared his position, and was convinced by one of their number, Jean Grave, to draft a document encouraging anarchist support for the Allies. The resulting manifesto was published in the pages of the pro-war socialist periodical La Bataille  on March 14, 1916, and republished in other European anarchist periodicals shortly thereafter. The manifesto declared that supporting the war was an act of resistance against the aggression of the German Empire, and that the war had to be pursued until its defeat. At this point, the authors conjectured, the ruling political parties of Germany would be overthrown and the anarchist goal of the emancipation of Europe and of the German people would be advanced.\nContrary to its misleading title, the Manifesto of the Sixteen had originally fifteen signatories\u2014among them some of the most eminent anarchists in Europe\u2014and was later countersigned by another hundred. The position of the Manifesto was in stark contrast to that of most anarchists of the day, many of whom denounced its signatories and their sympathizers, and accused them of betraying anarchist principles. In the fallout over the war, Kropotkin became increasingly isolated, with many former friends cutting their ties to him. The Russian anarchist movement was split into two, with a faction supporting Kropotkin's position to the strong criticism of the Bolsheviks. Elsewhere, the Spanish and Swiss anarchist movements dismissed the Manifesto and marginalized its supporters.", "hasanswer": true}]}
{"id": "50_2", "question": "Who is the author of Peace?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_20097", "text": "The novel that made its author \"the true lion of the Russian literature\" (according to Ivan Goncharov) enjoyed great success with the reading public upon its publication and spawned dozens of reviews and analytical essays, some of which (by Dmitry Pisarev, Pavel Annenkov, Dragomirov and Strakhov) formed the basis for the research of later Tolstoy scholars. Yet the Russian press's initial response to the novel was muted, with most critics unable to decide how to classify it. The liberal newspaper Golos (The Voice, April 3, #93, 1865) was one of the first to react. Its anonymous reviewer posed a question later repeated by many others: \"What could this possibly be? What kind of genre are we supposed to file it to?.. Where is fiction in it, and where is real history?\"Writer and critic Nikolai Akhsharumov, writing in Vsemirny Trud (#6, 1867) suggested that War and Peace was \"neither a chronicle, nor a historical novel\", but a genre merger, this ambiguity never undermining its immense value. Annenkov, who praised the novel too, was equally vague when trying to classify it. \"The cultural history of one large section of our society, the political and social panorama of it in the beginning of the current century,\" was his suggestion. \"It is the [social] epic, the history novel and the vast picture of the whole nation's life,\" wrote Ivan Turgenev in his bid to define War and Peace in the foreword for his French translation of \"The Two Hussars\" (published in Paris by Le Temps in 1875).\nIn general, the literary left received the novel coldly. They saw it as devoid of social critique, and keen on the idea of national unity. They saw its major fault as the \"author's inability to portray a new kind of revolutionary intelligentsia in his novel\", as critic Varfolomey Zaytsev put it. Articles by D. Minayev, Vasily Bervi-Flerovsky and N. Shelgunov in Delo magazine characterized the novel as \"lacking realism\", showing its characters as \"cruel and rough\", \"mentally stoned\", \"morally depraved\" and promoting \"the philosophy of stagnation\". Still, Mikhail Saltykov-Schedrin, who never expressed his opinion of the novel publicly, in private conversation was reported to have expressed delight with \"how strongly this Count has stung our higher society\". Dmitry Pisarev in his unfinished article \"Russian Gentry of Old\" (Staroye barstvo, Otechestvennye Zapiski, #2, 1868), while praising Tolstoy's realism in portraying members of high society, was still unhappy with the way the author, as he saw it, 'idealized' the old nobility, expressing \"unconscious and quite natural tenderness towards\" the Russian dvoryanstvo. On the opposite front, the conservative press and \"patriotic\" authors (A. S. Norov and P. A. Vyazemsky among them) were accusing Tolstoy of consciously distorting 1812 history, desecrating the \"patriotic feelings of our fathers\" and ridiculing dvoryanstvo.One of the first comprehensive articles on the novel was that of Pavel Annenkov, published in #2, 1868 issue of Vestnik Evropy. The critic praised Tolstoy's masterful portrayal of man at war, marveled at the complexity of the whole composition, organically merging historical facts and fiction. \"The dazzling side of the novel,\" according to Annenkov, was \"the natural simplicity with which [the author] transports the worldly affairs and big social events down to the level of a character who witnesses them.\" Annekov thought the historical gallery of the novel was incomplete with the two \"great raznotchintsys\", Speransky and Arakcheyev, and deplored the fact that the author stopped at introducing to the novel \"this relatively rough but original element.\" In the end the critic called the novel \"the whole epoch in the Russian fiction.\"Slavophiles declared Tolstoy their \"bogatyr\" and pronounced War and Peace \"the Bible of the new national idea\". Several articles on War and Peace were published in 1869\u201370 in Zarya magazine by Nikolay Strakhov. \"War and Peace is the work of genius, equal to everything that the Russian literature has produced before\", he pronounced in the first, smaller essay. \"It is now quite clear that from 1868 when the War and Peace was published the very essence of what we call Russian literature has become quite different, acquired the new form and meaning\", the critic continued later. Strakhov was the first critic in Russia who declared Tolstoy's novel to be a masterpiece of a level previously unknown in Russian literature. Still, being a true Slavophile, he could not fail to see the novel as promoting the major Slavophiliac ideas of \"meek Russian character's supremacy over the rapacious European kind\" (using Apollon Grigoryev's formula). Years later, in 1878, discussing Strakhov's own book The World as a Whole, Tolstoy criticized both Grigoriev's concept (of \"Russian meekness vs. Western bestiality\") and Strakhov's interpretation of it.\nAmong the reviewers were military men and authors specializing in war literature. Most assessed highly the artfulness and realism of Tolstoy's battle scenes. N. Lachinov, a member of the Russky Invalid newspaper staff (#69, April 10, 1868) called the Battle of Sch\u00f6ngrabern scenes \"bearing the highest degree of historical and artistic truthfulness\" and totally agreed with the author's view on the Battle of Borodino, which some of his opponents disputed. The army general and respected military writer Mikhail Dragomirov, in an article published in Oruzheiny Sbornik (The Military Almanac, 1868\u201370), while disputing some of Tolstoy's ideas concerning the \"spontaneity\" of wars and the role of commander in battles, advised all the Russian Army officers to use War and Peace as their desk book, describing its battle scenes as \"incomparable\" and \"serving for an ideal manual to every textbook on theories of military art.\"Unlike professional literary critics, most prominent Russian writers of the time supported the novel wholeheartedly. Goncharov, Turgenev, Leskov, Dostoevsky and Fet have all gone on record as declaring War and Peace the masterpiece of Russian literature. Ivan Goncharov in a July 17, 1878, letter to Pyotr Ganzen advised him to choose for translating into Danish War and Peace, adding: \"This is positively what might be called a Russian Iliad. Embracing the whole epoch, it is the grandiose literary event, showcasing the gallery of great men painted by a lively brush of the great master ... This is one of the most, if not the most profound literary work ever\". In 1879, unhappy with Ganzen having chosen Anna Karenina to start with, Goncharov insisted: \"War and Peace is the extraordinary poem of a novel, both in content and execution. It also serves as a monument to Russian history's glorious epoch when whatever figure you take is a colossus, a statue in bronze. Even [the novel's] minor characters carry all the characteristic features of the Russian people and its life.\" In 1885, expressing satisfaction with the fact that Tolstoy's works had by then been translated into Danish, Goncharov again stressed the immense importance of War and Peace. \"Count Tolstoy really mounts over everybody else here [in Russia]\", he remarked.Fyodor Dostoevsky (in a May 30, 1871, letter to Strakhov) described War and Peace as \"the last word of the landlord's literature and the brilliant one at that.\" In a draft version of The Raw Youth he described Tolstoy as \"a historiograph of the dvoryanstvo, or rather, its cultural elite.\" \"The objectivity and realism impart wonderful charm to all scenes, and alongside people of talent, honour and duty he exposes numerous scoundrels, worthless goons and fools,\" he added. In 1876 Dostoevsky wrote: \"My strong conviction is that a writer of fiction has to have most profound knowledge\u2014not only of the poetic side of his art, but also the reality he deals with, in its historical as well as contemporary context. Here [in Russia], as far as I see it, only one writer excels in this, Count Lev Tolstoy.\"Nikolai Leskov, then an anonymous reviewer in Birzhevy Vestnik (The Stock Exchange Herald), wrote several articles praising highly War and Peace, calling it \"the best ever Russian historical novel\" and \"the pride of the contemporary literature\". Marveling at the realism and factual truthfulness of Tolstoy's book, Leskov thought the author deserved the special credit for \"having lifted up the people's spirit upon the high pedestal it deserved\". \"While working most elaborately upon individual characters, the author, apparently, has been studying most diligently the character of the nation as a whole; the life of people whose moral strength came to be concentrated in the Army that came up to fight mighty Napoleon. In this respect the novel of Count Tolstoy could be seen as an epic of the Great national war which up until now has had its historians but never had its singers\", Leskov wrote.Afanasy Fet, in a January 1, 1870, letter to Tolstoy, expressed his great delight with the novel. \"You've managed to show us in great detail the other, mundane side of life and explain how organically does it feed the outer, heroic side of it\", he added.Ivan Turgenev gradually re-considered his initial skepticism as to the novel's historical aspect and also the style of Tolstoy's psychological analysis. In his 1880 article written in the form of a letter addressed to Edmond Abou, the editor of the French newspaper Le XIXe Si\u00e8cle, Turgenev described Tolstoy as \"the most popular Russian writer\" and War and Peace as \"one of the most remarkable books of our age.\" \"This vast work has the spirit of an epic, where the life of Russia of the beginning of our century in general and in details has been recreated by the hand of a true master ... The manner in which Count Tolstoy conducts his treatise is innovative and original. This is the great work of a great writer, and in it there\u2019s true, real Russia,\" Turgenev wrote. It was largely due to Turgenev's efforts that the novel started to gain popularity with the European readership. The first French edition of the War and Peace (1879) paved the way for the worldwide success of Leo Tolstoy and his works.Since then many world-famous authors have praised War and Peace as a masterpiece of world literature. Gustave Flaubert expressed his delight in a January 1880 letter to Turgenev, writing: \"This is the first class work! What an artist and what a psychologist! The first two volumes are exquisite. I used to utter shrieks of delight while reading. This is powerful, very powerful indeed.\" Later John Galsworthy called War and Peace \"the best novel that had ever been written\". Romain Rolland, remembering his reading the novel as a student, wrote, \"This work, like life itself, has no beginning, no end. It is life itself in its eternal movement.\" Thomas Mann thought War and Peace to be \"the greatest ever war novel in the history of literature.\" When Virginia Woolf finished the book, she declared \"There remains the greatest of all novelists\u2014for what else can we call the author of War and Peace?\" Ernest Hemingway confessed that it was from Tolstoy that he had been taking lessons on how to \"write about war in the most straightforward, honest, objective and stark way.\" \"I don't know anybody who could write about war better than Tolstoy did\", Hemingway asserted in his 1955 Men at War. The Best War Stories of All Time anthology.Isaac Babel said, after reading War and Peace, \"If the world could write by itself, it would write like Tolstoy.\" Tolstoy \"gives us a unique combination of the 'naive objectivity' of the oral narrator with the interest in detail characteristic of realism. This is the reason for our trust in his presentation.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

Mason, Minister to France, on U.S. policy toward Cuba. He had previously written to Soul\u00e9 that, if Cuba's purchase could not be negotiated, \"you will then direct your effort to the next desirable object, which is to detach that island from the Spanish dominion and from all dependence on any European power\"\u2014words Soul\u00e9 may have adapted to fit his own agenda. Authors David Potter and Lars Schoultz both note the considerable ambiguity in Marcy's cryptic words, and Samuel Bemis suggests he may have referred to Cuban independence, but acknowledges it is impossible to know Marcy's true intent. In any case, Marcy had also written in June that the administration had abandoned thoughts of declaring war over Cuba. But Robert May writes, \"the instructions for the conference had been so vague, and so many of Marcy's letters to Soul\u00e9 since the Black Warrior incident had been bellicose, that the ministers misread the administration's intent.\"After a minor disagreement about their meeting site, the three American diplomats met in Ostend, Belgium from October 9\u201311, 1854, then adjourned to Aachen, Prussia, for a week to prepare a report of the proceedings.  The resulting dispatch, which would come to be known as the Ostend Manifesto, declared that \"Cuba is as necessary to the North American republic as any of its present members, and that it belongs naturally to that great family of states of which the Union is the Providential Nursery\".Prominent among the reasons for annexation outlined in the manifesto were fears of a possible slave revolt in Cuba parallel to the Haitian Revolution (1791\u20131804) in the absence of U.S. intervention. The Manifesto urged against inaction on the Cuban question, warning,\n\nWe should, however, be recreant to our duty, be unworthy of our gallant forefathers, and commit base treason against our posterity, should we permit Cuba to be Africanized and become a second St. Domingo (Haiti), with all its attendant horrors to the white race, and suffer the flames to extend to our own neighboring shores, seriously to endanger or actually to consume the fair fabric of our Union.\nRacial fears, largely spread by Spain, raised tension and anxiety in the U.S. over a potential black uprising on the island that could \"spread like wildfire\" to the southern U.S. The Manifesto stated that the U.S. would be \"justified in wresting\" Cuba from Spain if the colonial power refused to sell it.Soul\u00e9 was a former U.S. Senator from Louisiana and member of the Young America movement, who sought a realization of American influence in the Caribbean and Central America. He is credited as the primary architect of the policy expressed in the Ostend Manifesto. The experienced and cautious Buchanan is believed to have written the document and moderated Soul\u00e9's aggressive tone. Soul\u00e9 highly favored expansion of Southern influence outside the current Union of States. His belief in Manifest Destiny led him to prophesy \"absorption of the entire continent and its island appendages\" by the U.S. Mason's Virginian roots predisposed him to the sentiments expressed in the document, but he later regretted his actions. Buchanan's exact motivations remain unclear despite his expansionist tendencies, but it has been suggested that he was seduced by visions of the presidency, which he would go on to win in 1856. One historian concluded in 1893, \"When we take into account the characteristics of the three men we can hardly resist the conclusion that Soul\u00e9, as he afterwards intimated, twisted his colleagues round his finger.\"To Marcy's chagrin, the flamboyant Soul\u00e9 made no secret of the meetings. The press in both Europe and the U.S. were well aware of the proceedings if not their outcome, but were preoccupied with wars and midterm elections. In the latter case, the Democratic Party became a minority in the United States Congress, and editorials continued to chide the Pierce administration for its secrecy. At least one newspaper, the New York Herald, published what Brown calls \"reports that came so close to the truth of the decisions at Ostend that the President feared they were based on leaks, as indeed they may have been\". Pierce feared the political repercussions of confirming such rumors, and he did not acknowledge them in his State of the Union address at the end of 1854. The administration's opponents in the House of Representatives called for the document's release, and it was published in full four months after being written.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The book details the sexual life of teenagers in Samoan society in the early 20th century, and theorizes that culture has a leading influence on psychosexual development.\nFirst published in 1928, the book launched Mead as a pioneering researcher and as the most famous anthropologist in the world. Since its first publication, Coming of Age in Samoa was the most widely read book in the field of anthropology until Napoleon Chagnon's Yanomam\u00f6: The Fierce People overtook it. The book has sparked years of ongoing and intense debate and controversy on questions pertaining to society, culture, and science. It is a key text in the nature versus nurture debate, as well as in discussions on issues relating to family, adolescence, gender, social norms, and attitudes.In the 1980s, Derek Freeman contested many of Mead's claims, and argued that she was hoaxed into counterfactually believing that Samoan culture had more relaxed sexual norms than Western culture. However, several members of the anthropology community have rejected Freeman's criticism, accusing him of cherry picking his data, and misrepresenting both Mead's research and the interviews that he conducted.   Mead's field work for \"Coming of Age\" was also scrutinized, and major discrepancies were found between her published statements and her field data.

{"id": "50_9", "question": "Who is the author of Starship Troopers?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_18421", "text": "Heinlein's books, and Starship Troopers in particular, had an enormous impact on political science fiction, to the extent that author Ken MacLeod has stated that \"the political strand in [science fiction] can be described as a dialogue with Heinlein,\" although many participants in this dialogue disagree with Heinlein. Science fiction critic Darko Suvin states that Starship Troopers is the \"ancestral text of US science fiction militarism\" and that it shaped the debate about the role of the military in society for many years.In addition to his political views, Heinlein's ideas about a futuristic military as depicted in the novel were deeply influential among films, books, and television shows in later years. Roger Beaumont has suggested that Starship Troopers may some day be considered a manual for extraterrestrial warfare. Suvin refers to Juan Rico as the \"archetypal Space Soldier\". Starship Troopers included concepts in military engineering which have since been widely used in other fiction, and which have occasionally been paralleled by scientific research. The novel has been cited as the source of the idea of powered armor exoskeletons, which Heinlein describes in great detail. Such suits became a staple of military science fiction. Franchises that have employed this technology include Iron Man, Exo Squad, Halo, District 9, Elysium, and Edge of Tomorrow. During the shooting of the classic science fiction film Aliens, director James Cameron required the actors playing space marines to read Starship Troopers to understand their parts, and also cited it as an influence for the space drop, terms like \"bug hunt\", and the cargo-loader exoskeleton.Starship Troopers had a direct influence on many later science fiction stories. John Steakley's 1984 novel Armor was, according to the author, born out of frustration with the small amount of actual combat in Starship Troopers and because he wanted this aspect developed further. The \"Mobile Suits\" from the 1979 Nippon Sunrise anime series Mobile Suit Gundam were inspired by the powered armor from Starship Troopers. The 1988 Gainax OVA series Gunbuster has plot elements similar to Starship Troopers, depicting humanity arrayed against an alien military. Scholars have identified elements of Heinlein's influence in Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, as well. Hantke, in particular, compares the battle room in Ender's Game to Heinlein's prosthetic suits, stating that they both regulate but also enhance human agency. Suvin suggests parallels between the plots of the two novels, with human society in both stories at war against insect-like aliens, but states that the story of Ender Wiggin takes a very different direction, as Ender regrets his genocidal actions and dedicates his efforts to protecting his erstwhile targets.Conversely, Joe Haldeman's 1974 anti-war, Hugo- and Nebula-winning science fiction novel The Forever War is popularly thought to be a direct reply to Starship Troopers, and though Haldeman has stated that it is actually a result of his personal experiences in the Vietnam War, he has admitted to being influenced by Starship Troopers. Haldeman said that he disagreed with Starship Troopers because it \"glorifies war\", but added that \"it's a very well-crafted novel, and I believe Heinlein was honest with it\". The Forever War contains several parallels to Starship Troopers, including its setting. Commentators have described it as a reaction to Heinlein's novel, a suggestion Haldeman denies; the two novels are very different in terms of their attitude towards the military. The Forever War does not depict war as a noble pursuit, with the sides clearly defined as good and evil; instead, the novel explores the dehumanizing effect of war, influenced by the real world context of the Vietnam War. Haldeman received a letter from Heinlein, congratulating him on his Nebula Award, which \"meant more than the award itself\". According to author Spider Robinson, Heinlein approached Haldeman at the awards banquet and said the book \"may be the best future war story I've ever read!\"Harry Harrison's 1965 novel Bill, the Galactic Hero has also been described as a reaction to Starship Troopers, while Gordon R. Dickson's 1961 novel Naked to the Stars has been called \"an obvious rejoinder\" to Starship Troopers. Ring of Swords, written by Eleanor Arnason in 1993, also depicts a war between two highly aggressive species, of which humans are one. The story deliberately inverts several aspects of Starship Troopers: the story is told from the point of view of diplomats seeking to prevent war, rather than soldiers fighting it, and the conflict is the result of the two species being extremely similar, rather than different.The setting of the video game Helldivers 2 has been described as being heavily influenced by Starship Troopers and its film adaptation. The game takes the original patriotic motif to a humorous extreme, and has been described as a satire of fascism.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The seaside village of Mumbles has a Victorian pier, small, independent shops and boutiques, restaurants and cafes. The south coast of Gower is the chief magnet for walkers, with a path stretching from Mumbles Head across the cliff tops, beaches and coastal woodland to Rhossili.\nOn the Waterfront, Swansea Bay has a five-mile (eight-kilometre) sweep of coastline which features a beach, promenade, children's lido, leisure pool, marina and maritime quarter featuring the museums the National Waterfront Museum and Swansea Museum, the oldest museum in Wales. Also situated in the maritime quarter is the Dylan Thomas Centre, which celebrates the life and work of the author with its permanent exhibition 'Dylan Thomas \u2013 Man and Myth', and Mission Gallery, a unique art gallery also in the heart of the Maritime Quarter which hosts a range of exhibitions from various art disciplines; it also host a craft space, with ranging works from local and international artists. The Dylan Thomas Centre is the focal point for the annual Dylan Thomas Festival (27 October \u2013 9 November). There is a permanent exhibition at the Dylan Thomas Birthplace and Home for 23 years in Uplands which has been restored to its condition as a new house when bought by the Thomas family in 1914 a few months before Dylan was born in the front bedroom. The SA1 Waterfront area is the latest development for living, dining and leisure.\nSwansea Bay, Mumbles and Gower are home to various parks and gardens and almost 20 nature reserves. Clyne Gardens is home to a collection of plants set in parkland and host to 'Clyne in Bloom' in May. Singleton Park has acres of parkland, a botanical garden, a boating lake with pedal boats, and crazy golf. Plantasia is a tropical hothouse pyramid featuring three climatic zones, housing a variety of unusual plants, including several species which are extinct in the wild, and monkeys, reptiles, fish and a butterfly house. Other parks include Cwmdonkin Park, where Dylan Thomas played as a child, and Victoria Park which is close to the promenade on the seafront.Oxwich Bay on the Gower Peninsula was named the most beautiful beach in Britain by travel writers who visited more than 1,000 beaches around the world in search of the perfect sands (2007). The Travel Magazine praised Oxwich for \"magnificent and unspoilt\" scenery and as a \"great place for adults and children to explore\". It has over three miles (5 km) of sand and The Guardian named it one of Britain's blue-riband top 10 category beaches (2007). The Independent newspaper hailed Rhossili Bay as \"the British supermodel of beaches\" (2006) and the best beach in Britain for breathtaking cliffs (2007), whilst The Sunday Times listed it as one of the 25 best beaches in the world (2006). Thanks to its clear air and lovely golden sand, this romantic stretch of sand was voted the best place in the UK to watch the sun set (Country Living magazine 2005) and one of the top romantic spots in the country (The Guardian 2007).Llangennith Beach, with its soft sands, consistent beach break and great facilities, was listed as the best place to learn how to surf in Britain by The Observer (2006) and one of the 10 'classic surfing beaches by The Guardian (2007). Gower also claims Britain's Best Beach, Three Cliffs Bay. The Gower landmark topped the BBC Holiday Hit Squad nationwide competition (2006) and was voted Britain's best camping beach by The Independent thanks to its superb setting and quiet location (2007). Three Cliffs Bay also made the final of the ITV series Britain's Favourite View \u2013 the only nomination in Wales and backed by singer Katherine Jenkins. Nearby Brandy Cove came sixth in an online poll to find the UK's top beach for the baby boomer generation (2006). Beaches which won 2006 Blue Flag Beach Awards are: Bracelet Bay, Caswell Bay, Langland Bay, Port Eynon Bay and Swansea Marina (one of the few Blue Flag Marinas in Wales). All of these beaches also won a Seaside Award 2006. Limeslade was awarded the Rural Seaside Award and the Green Coast Award. Other Green Coast Awards went to Pwll Du, Rhossili Bay and Tor Bay.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "50_12", "question": "Who is the author of \"Downbelow Station\"?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_18429", "text": "Space is explored not by short-sighted governments but by the Earth Company, a private corporation which becomes enormously wealthy and powerful as a result. Nine star systems are found to lack planets suitable for colonization, so space stations are built in orbit instead, stepping stones for further exploration. Then, Pell's World is found to be not only habitable, but already populated by the gentle, sentient (if technologically backward) Hisa. Pell Station is built. The planet is nicknamed \"Downbelow\" by the stationers, who also start to call their home \"Downbelow Station\".\nWhen Earth's out-of-touch policies cause it to begin losing control of its more distant stations and worlds, it builds a fleet of fifty military carriers, the Earth Company Fleet, to enforce its will. This leads to the prolonged Company War with the breakaway Union, based at Cyteen, another habitable world. Caught in between are the stationers and the merchanters who crew the freighters that maintain interstellar trade.\nSet in the final days of the war, Downbelow Station opens with Earth Company Captain Signy Mallory and her warship, Norway, escorting a ragtag fleet fleeing from Russell's and Mariner Stations to Pell.  Similar convoys arrive from other stations destroyed or lost to Union, leading to an enormous crisis. The flood of unexpected refugees strains station resources. Angelo Konstantin, Stationmaster of Pell, and his two sons, Damon and Emilio, struggle to cope with the situation. Fearing Union infiltrators and saboteurs, Pell dumps all the refugees in a Quarantine Zone, causing massive dislocations of Pell's own citizens.\nWhile conferring with Pell's administrators, Mallory encounters a delegation from the Earth Company, led by Segust Ayres, Second Secretary of Earth's Security Council. Offended by her brusque, arrogant manner, Ayres declines her offer of transportation to the front and charters a freighter instead. Unbeknownst to Mallory, Ayres' mission is to open peace negotiations with Union.\nMallory also drops off a Union prisoner of war, Josh Talley, whom she had rescued from a brutal interrogation by panicked security forces at Russell's. However, on the voyage to Pell, her sexual exploitation of him had been only marginally less abusive. Faced with indefinite confinement on Pell, Talley requests Adjustment, the wiping of much of his memory, in return for his freedom. When questioned by Damon Konstantin, he requests Adjustment to escape the indefinite imprisonment, so Konstantin reluctantly gives his permission.  Upon later review of his file, Damon learns that Talley had already undergone the treatment once before at Russell's.  Still feeling guilty for agreeing, he and his wife Elene Quen befriend the post-Adjustment Talley, an act of kindness that will have monumental, unforeseen consequences.\nJon Lukas, Angelo Konstantin's brother-in-law and only rival for power, is worried about the course of the war. The Fleet has received little or no support from an indifferent Earth and is gradually losing a war of attrition. He secretly contacts Union, offering to hand Pell over. Union responds by smuggling in a secret agent named Jessad.\nMeanwhile, the last ten surviving Company Fleet ships under the command of Conrad Mazian gather for the most critical operation of the war. All of Mazian's recent strategic maneuvers and raids have been leading up to this point. If they can take out Viking Station in one coordinated strike before their enemy's growing numerical superiority can overwhelm them, there would be a wide, barren region between Earth and Union space, one which would make further conflict vastly more costly for Union.\nSeb Azov, the Union military commander, has no choice but to gather his forces at Viking to await Mazian's anticipated attack. However, he has an ace up his sleeve. He has pressured Ayres into recording a message ordering Mazian to break off while peace is being negotiated. When Mazian strikes, Ayres' broadcast order does indeed force him to abort and the Fleet retreats to Pell in confusion.\nMazian meets with his captains and gives them the choice of accepting a peace treaty that essentially concedes victory to Union as per Ayres' broadcast or rebelling against Earth and continuing to fight that is his preference. They all remain loyal to their leader. One of Mazian's first acts is to place Pell under martial law.\nThe Fleet is now forced to defend Downbelow Station, its only reliable base and supply source. Union forces attack and destroy two ships out on patrol. While Union suffers casualties as well, it can replace its losses, unlike Mazian. Counting one carrier lost earlier in the debacle at Viking, he has just seven ships left.\nUnder cover of the panic on the station caused by the battle in space, Lukas makes his move, killing and supplanting his hated rival, Angelo Konstantin. To escape rioting refugees, Elene Quen is forced to board Finity's End, one of the most respected merchanter ships. The freighters flee the battle zone, but Quen convinces most of them to band together, for safety and to maximize their leverage whatever happens. Damon survives his uncle's assassination attempt and links up with Talley. Together, they manage to hide from Lukas; in fact, Talley discovers he is surprisingly good at it.\nEventually, they are contacted by Jessad, and Talley finds out why. He and Jessad are the same kind: azi, artificially bred and, in Jessad and Talley's case, trained especially for espionage and sabotage. They are discovered by Fleet marines; Jessad is killed, while Konstantin and Talley are captured and taken to Mallory.\nShe receives orders from Mazian to quietly dispose of Konstantin. Lukas does the Fleet's bidding with far fewer scruples, so Konstantin is superfluous, even dangerous. Mazian is preparing to disable and abandon Downbelow Station. He has another goal in mind: to take over Earth itself in a surprise coup d'etat. The wrecking of Pell would create a firebreak with Union, playing the role he had originally intended for Viking.\nMallory has different ideas. Mazian has gone too far for her to stomach. She abruptly undocks from Pell and deserts. Mallory finds the Union forces and persuades Azov to unleash them against her former comrades. Talley is instrumental in convincing Azov of Mallory's truthfulness.\nMazian cannot afford a costly fight, so the Fleet sets off for Earth prematurely. Azov needs to pursue him, but is unwilling to leave Norway intact behind him. The tense standoff is broken by a timely arrival; Quen returns with the united merchanter fleet and claims Pell for the newborn Merchanter's Alliance, with Norway as its militia. Without the authority to deal with this new development and unwilling to fight the merchanters, Azov leaves to deal with Mazian.\nThe end of the Company War is at last in sight, much to the relief of the Konstantins, the merchanters, and the residents of Downbelow Station.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Many reviews of The Hot Zone exemplify the impact the book had on the public's view of emerging viruses. A review in the British Medical Journal captures the paranoia and public panic described in this book. The reviewer was left \"wondering when and where this enigmatic agent will appear next and what other disasters may await human primates\". This can also be seen in a review in the Public Health Reports which highlights the \"seriousness of our current situation\" and \"our ability to respond to a major health threat\".The Hot Zone is described as a \"romantic account of environmental transgression\". Reactions to this book could be seen not only in the public's view of emerging viruses, but in the changes in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition to the funding of public health infrastructure during the early 1970s, there were many public discussions of biodefense. This book continued to fuel the emerging diseases campaign.

He killed a man in a fight resulting from a game of paume (presumably some form of Basque pelota) and had to flee. In Seville he joined a unit of dragoons, soldiers with police functions.\n\nOne day he met Carmen, then working in the cigar factory he was guarding. As he alone in his unit ignored her, she teased him. A few hours later, he arrested her for cutting \"x\"s in a co-worker's face in a quarrel. She convinced him by speaking Basque that she was half Basque, and he let her go, for which he was imprisoned for a month and demoted.\nAfter his release, he encountered her again and she repaid him with a day of bliss, followed by another when he allowed her fellow smugglers to pass his post. He looked for her at the house of one of her Romani friends, but she entered with his lieutenant. In the ensuing fight, Jos\u00e9 killed the lieutenant. He fled to Carmen's outlaw band.\nWith the outlaws, he progressed from smuggling to robbery, and was sometimes with Carmen but suffered from jealousy as she used her attractions to further the band's enterprises; he also learned that she was married. After her husband joined the band, Jos\u00e9 provoked a knife fight with him and killed him. Carmen became Jos\u00e9's wife.\nHowever, she told him she loved him less than before, and she became attracted to a successful young picador named Lucas. Jos\u00e9, mad with jealousy, begged her to forsake other men and live with him; they could start an honest life in America. She said that she knew from omens that he was fated to kill her, but \"Carmen will always be free,\" and as she now hated herself for having loved him, she would never give in to him. He stabbed her to death and then turned himself in. Don Jos\u00e9 ends his tale by saying that the Romani are to blame for the way they raised Carmen.\nPart IV.

Alone, Hart stakes out a warehouse in the desert thought to be a print house of counterfeiter and artist Eric \"Rick\" Masters, and is killed by Masters and his bodyguard, Jack. Chance proclaims to his new partner, John Vukovich, that he will take Masters down no matter what.\nThe two agents attempt to get information on Masters by putting one of his criminal associates, attorney Max Waxman, under surveillance. Vukovich falls asleep on watch, which allows Masters to murder Waxman, who had crossed him. While Vukovich wants to go by the book, Chance becomes increasingly reckless and unethical in pursuit of Masters. He relies on his sexual-extortion relationship with parolee/informant Ruth for information, while Vukovich meets privately with Masters' associates, including attorney Bob Grimes, whom he attempts to flip. Grimes, acknowledging a potential conflict of interest that could ruin his legal practice, agrees to set up a meeting between his client and the two agents, who pose as doctors from Palm Springs interested in Masters' counterfeiting services. Masters is reluctant to work with them, but ultimately agrees to print them $1 million worth of fake bills.\nIn turn, Masters demands $30,000 in front money, which is three times the authorized agency limit for buy money. To get the cash, Chance persuades Vukovich to aid him in robbing Thomas Ling, a man whom Ruth previously told Chance is bringing in $50,000 cash to purchase stolen diamonds. Chance and Vukovich intercept Ling at Union Station and seize the cash in an industrial area under the Sixth Street Viaduct. Ling's cover people follow them and, while observing the robbery, open fire and accidentally kill Ling. Chance and Vukovich try to evade them through the streets, freeways and even one of the flood control channels, before a final escape by going the wrong way on the freeway. \nThe next day, the end of their daily briefing includes a bulletin that Ling was an undercover FBI agent who was killed while engaging in a sting operation. Only a generic description of the assailants and their vehicle is given. While Chance and Vukovich did not kill Ling, Vukovich is nonetheless consumed by guilt, while Chance is apathetic and focused solely on getting Masters. Unable to persuade Chance to come clean about their role in Ling's death, Vukovich meets with Grimes, who advises him to turn himself in and testify against Chance in exchange for a lighter sentence. Vukovich refuses to implicate his partner. Chance sets up the buy with Masters, who seems to hint that he is aware of the heist.\nChance and Vukovich meet with Masters for the exchange. After inspecting the counterfeit million, the agents attempt to arrest Masters and Jack, but Jack pulls a shotgun. Jack and Chance fatally shoot each other, and Masters escapes. Vukovich gives chase, going to a warehouse a previous informant had told him about. By the time he arrives, Masters has set fire to everything inside, destroying all evidence. Vukovich confronts Masters and during a brief struggle, Masters asks Vukovich why he did not take Grimes' advice to turn his partner in, revealing that Grimes was working on Masters' behalf all along. While Vukovich is stunned at the revelation, Masters grabs a board and knocks him unconscious. Masters then covers Vukovich with shredded paper and is about to set him on fire when Vukovich comes round and shoots Masters. Masters drops his lighter and accidentally sets himself ablaze. Vukovich shoots the burning man, continuing to pull the trigger of his empty gun as Masters burns alive.\nDressed more casually, Vukovich visits Ruth as she packs up to leave Los Angeles. He mentions Chance's death, suggesting she had known all along that Ling was an FBI agent and she had played Chance. He knows Chance left her with the remaining cash, which the agency now wants back, but Ruth says she needed it to pay debts. Vukovich declares that Ruth is now working for him, turning into the same \"whatever it takes\" agent that Chance had been, and stopping her efforts to escape her shady life.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It has, according to J. Michael Lennon, been \"the most discussed American essay in the quarter century after World War II\". According to Tracy Dahlby, Mailer's views were a hot topic in 1957 and many of his critics accused him of accepting violence as a \"form of existential expression\".In a letter to Albert Murray, Ralph Ellison called the essay \"the same old primitivism crap in a new package\". Similarly, Allen Ginsberg termed the essay \"very square\" and recalled that Jack Kerouac thought Mailer an \"intellectual fool\". Both considered The White Negro a \"macho folly\" that could not be reconciled with the \"tenderheartedness\" of the Beat perspective. Ginsberg saw no Dostoyevskian hero in Mailer's violent Hipster.\nSeveral prominent critics, such as James Baldwin, chided Mailer publicly for their perception that, with The White Negro, he was openly aping lesser writers such as Jack Kerouac in order to jump on the bandwagon of moody, meandering, faux-thrill-seeking Beatniks. Baldwin, in his essay \"The Black Boy Looks at the White Boy\" for Esquire (May 1961) called The White Negro \"impenetrable\", and wondered how Mailer, a writer that he saw as brilliant and talented, could write an essay that was so beneath him. For Baldwin, Mailer's essay simply perpetuated the \"myth of the sexuality of Negros\" while attempting to sell white people their own innocence and purity. Baldwin showed great respect for Mailer's talent, but aligned The White Negro with other distractions \u2014 like running for mayor of NYC \u2014 that Baldwin saw as beneath Mailer and distracted him from his real responsibility as a writer.Kate Millett's view of The White Negro criticized Mailer of making a virtue of violence. In her book Sexual Politics, she makes the claim that Mailer finds that violence is something that he has fallen in love with as a personal and sexual style. She states that for Mailer, \"a rapist is only rapist to a square\" and that \"rape is a part of life\".  Millett goes on to criticize Mailer of matching the aesthetic of Hip to harmful masculine pride. Additionally, Millett accuses WN of celebrating and romanticizing stereotypes about Black hyper-sexuality.\nSimilarly, author and intellectual Lorraine Hansberry joined Baldwin in rejecting the same message. She argued WN also excuses and idealizes society's denigrating and ostracizing Black people to further Mailer's agenda of repackaging White racism as Black iconoclasm. While Mailer seemed to have a sense of the historical importance of the late 1950s, explains Ginsberg, he was being an \"apocalyptic goof\" with his naive Hipster figuration that Kerouac saw as \"well intentioned but poisonous, in the sense that it encouraged an image of violence\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

David Scott overcame the difficulties his administration faced from the opposition of the Khasi Syiems \u2013 their chiefs and people. Impressed by the favourable cool climate of Khasi Hills, they negotiated with the Syiem of Sohra in 1829 for a sanatorium for the British.

It was the author's second novel. His first, Marthe (1876), had earned the praise of \u00c9mile Zola and Huysmans had come to be associated with the older author and his Naturalist school of fiction. Les S\u0153urs Vatard shows the clear influence of Naturalism, being a realistic depiction of working-class life based on meticulous documentation. \nThe novel tells the story of two sisters who work in a Parisian book-binding factory. Huysmans had inherited such a factory from his mother on her death in 1876, allowing him to observe the lives of his employees at close quarters. The plot concentrates on the unhappy love affairs of the sisters of the title, C\u00e9line and D\u00e9sir\u00e9e. C\u00e9line lives with an artist called Cyprien Tibaille - whose caustic remarks reflect Huysmans' own opinions - before leaving him for a man who beats her. Her more timid sister's relationship with the ineffectual Auguste also comes to nothing. However, the author's main focus is not the plot but vivid descriptions of the milieu in which the characters live. \nLes S\u0153urs Vatard was published by Charpentier on 26 February 1879. To Huysmans' surprise, the book sold moderately well. It received a glowing notice from Zola and was attacked by the more conservative critics who hated the typical bleakness of Naturalism. Gustave Flaubert, one of Huysmans' heroes, was impressed by what he called \"a powerful and outstanding work\", although he criticised the book for its lack of focus, use of slang and its promotion of Naturalist concepts of artistic taste.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The name of the city in ancient Greek is \u1f08\u03b8\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 (Ath\u0207nai), a plural toponym, designating the place where\u2014according to myth\u2014she presided over the Athenai, a sisterhood devoted to her worship. In ancient times, scholars argued whether Athena was named after Athens or Athens after Athena. Now scholars generally agree that the goddess takes her name from the city; the ending -ene is common in names of locations, but rare for personal names. Testimonies from different cities in ancient Greece attest that similar city goddesses were worshipped in other cities and, like Athena, took their names from the cities where they were worshipped. For example, in Mycenae there was a goddess called Mykene, whose sisterhood was known as Mykenai, whereas at Thebes an analogous deity was called Thebe, and the city was known under the plural form Thebai (or Thebes, in English, where the 's' is the plural formation). The name Athenai is likely of Pre-Greek origin because it contains the presumably Pre-Greek morpheme *-\u0101n-.In his dialogue Cratylus, the ancient Greek philosopher Plato (428\u2013347 BC) gives some rather imaginative etymologies of Athena's name, based on the theories of the ancient Athenians and his etymological speculations:\n\nThat is a graver matter, and there, my friend, the modern interpreters of Homer may, I think, assist in explaining the view of the ancients. Most of these in their explanations of the poet, assert that he meant by Athena \"mind\" [\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2, no\u0169s] and \"intelligence\" [\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1, di\u00e1noia], and the maker of names appears to have had a singular notion about her; and indeed calls her by a still higher title, \"divine intelligence\" [\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bd\u03cc\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, theo\u0169 n\u00f3\u0113sis], as though he would say: This is she who has the mind of God [\u1f01 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03b1, a theon\u00f3a]. Perhaps, however, the name Theonoe may mean \"she who knows divine things\" [\u03c4\u1f70 \u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03b1 \u03bd\u03bf\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b1, ta theia noousa] better than others. Nor shall we be far wrong in supposing that the author of it wished to identify this Goddess with moral intelligence [\u03b5\u03bd \u03ad\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bd\u03cc\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd, en \u00e9thei n\u00f3esin], and therefore gave her the name Etheonoe; which, however, either he or his successors have altered into what they thought a nicer form, and called her Athena.\nThus, Plato believed that Athena's name was derived from Greek \u1f08\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03b1, Atheon\u00f3a\u2014which the later Greeks rationalised as from the deity's (\u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2, the\u00f3s) mind (\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2, no\u0169s).

It is believed that, in Argonautica, a Greek epic poem about Jason and the Argonauts and their journey to Colchis, author Apollonius Rhodius considered Kutaisi their final destination as well as the residence of King Ae\u00ebtes.\n\nLater, it was the capital of the kingdom of Lazica until being occupied briefly by the Arabs. An Arab incursion into western Georgia was repelled by Abkhazians jointly with Lazic and Iberian allies in 736, towards c.786, Leon II won his full independence from Byzantine and transferred his capital to Kutaisi, thus unifying Lazica and Abasgia via a dynastic union. The latter led the unification of the Georgian monarchy in the 11th century.\nFrom 1008 to 1122, Kutaisi served as the capital of the United Kingdom of Georgia, and, from the 15th century until 1810, it was the capital of the Imeretian Kingdom. In 1508, the city was conquered by Selim I, who was the son of Bayezid II, the sultan of the Ottoman Empire.\nDuring the 17th century, Imeretian kings made many appeals to Russian Empire to help them in their struggle for independence from the Ottomans. All these appeals were ignored as Russia did not want to spoil relations with Turkey. Only in the reign of Catherine the Great, in 1768, were troops of general Gottlieb Heinrich Totleben sent to join the forces of King Heraclius II of Georgia, who hoped to reconquer the Ottoman-held southern Georgian lands, with Russian help. Totleben helped King Solomon I of Imereti to recover his capital, Kutaisi, on August 6, 1770.\n\nFinally, the Russian-Turkish wars ended in 1810 with the annexation of the Imeretian Kingdom by the Russian Empire. The city was the administrative capital of the Kutais Uyezd and the larger Kutaisi Governorate, which included much of west Georgia. In March 1879, the city was the site of a blood libel trial that attracted attention all over Russia; the ten accused Jews were acquitted.Kutaisi was a major industrial center before Georgia's independence on 9 April 1991. Independence was followed by the economic collapse of the country, and, as a result, many inhabitants of Kutaisi have had to work abroad. Small-scale trade prevails among the rest of the population.\nIn 2011, Mikheil Saakashvili, the president of Georgia, signed a constitutional amendment relocating the parliament to Kutaisi. On 26 May 2012, Saakashvili inaugurated the new Parliament building in Kutaisi. This was done in an effort to decentralise power and shift some political control closer to Abkhazia, although it has been criticised as marginalising the legislature, and also for the demolition of a Soviet War Memorial formerly at the new building's location. The subsequent government of the Georgian Dream passed a new constitution that moved the parliament back to Tbilisi, effective from January 2019.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The exact date of writing is unknown, and there is contention among scholars about when they were written. Paul Hammond among other scholars believes that sonnets 61-103 were written primarily during the early 1590s, and then being edited or added to later, during the early 1600s (decade). Regardless of date of writing, it was published later along with the rest of the sonnets of the 1609 Quarto.\nIn the sonnet, the poet writes of why he has stopped showering his muse with flowery praise and adoration. In his analysis of Shakespeare's Sonnets, David West suggests that the sequence of sonnets 100-103 and the silence described are a response to the infidelity of the Fair Youth in the Rival Poet sequence of sonnets (78-86), which has caused a rift between the poet and his Muse. He writes of how immediately following the Rival Poet sonnets, the Poet begins to speak of his lover being false and having forsaken him. West claims that this ultimately culminates in sonnets 100\u2013103, where the Poet expresses his regret over what has transpired.", "hasanswer": true}]}

One day, after looting a barrow, the tomb of a young warrior-king, she is chased by an armored man on horseback back to her village. He breaks into the poor home she shares with her family, helps himself to some food, and asks if anyone has seen a pale woman on a grey horse. After repulsing an attack by the men of the village, he departs for Shiuan, a richer land ruled by the khal, another race that is enough like humans to successfully interbreed.\nJherun, yearning for a less bleak future than marrying the thuggish Fwar, runs after him. Instead of finding him, she stumbles upon his mortal enemies: his cousin, Nhi Vanye, and Vanye's lord, Morgaine, the pale woman.\nThey inform her that Chya Roh's body had been taken over by an evil creature who had extended his life countless times by this means. He had betrayed Morgaine and sent ten thousand men to their doom a century before. Fleeing her, he had passed through a Gate from Vanye's world to this one, closing the passageway forever, but not quickly enough to prevent Morgaine and Vanye from following.\nJherun knows of two Gates, which she calls Wells. The newcomers had emerged from one; the other is in Shiuan. Morgaine's mission is to travel from world to world, closing their Gates permanently, as they can (and have in the past) destroyed whole civilizations when their immense power is misused. She is the last survivor of a band of one hundred sent for that purpose. Vanye is a chance-met warrior, bound to obey her initially by his stubborn sense of honor and later for other reasons.\nAs they travel towards Shiuan, it begins to rain heavily. They become separated when Vanye is knocked off his horse by an uprooted tree carried by the rapidly rising, onrushing water. He finds Jherun, but not Morgaine. Knowing that Morgaine will make for the Well of Shiuan, he heads there also, accompanied by Jherun.\nAlong the way, Jherun persuades him to seek food and shelter at the fortress of Ohtij-in, held by half-breed khal. This proves to be a grave mistake, as Roh had preceded him there. He treats Vanye well, claiming that the Roh Vanye knew still coexists with his \"murderer\"; Vanye is uncertain and does not kill him when Roh deliberately gives him the opportunity.\nRoh has promised the khal a way out of their dying world. The old lord, Bydarra, is skeptical, but his ruthless son Hetharu murders his father and puts the blame on Vanye. He assembles his forces and heads off to the Gate with Roh. Vanye is left behind, a prisoner of Hetharu's brother Kithan, but is rescued by Morgaine and an army she has recruited from Jherun's people and their neighbors, the marshlanders.\nHowever, when they learn what Morgaine intends, they turn on her, forcing her to kill many with her advanced weapons. Morgaine, Vanye, Jherun and Kithan flee on horseback, followed by the mob on foot. \nThey reach the control room for the Gate of Shiuan, only to find that Roh has opened the Gate and locked the controls. He has also left a message: he will allow Vanye safe passage through, but not Morgaine. She orders Vanye to go to Roh, wait his chance to kill him, and continue on with her mission. Knowing that the two of them stand no chance against Roh's army, he reluctantly obeys, taking the other two with him. Roh sees through the ruse immediately, but still accepts his cousin. \nAs they prepare to pass through the Gate, Morgaine attacks with the human rabble, with which she has forged an uneasy alliance. In the confusion, Vanye fights his way to her, and together they force their way through, to continue their quest on yet another world. The rest, khal and human alike, follow, save Jherun and Kithan.

He was no longer a grand ayatollah and deputy of the Imam, one who represents the Hidden Imam, but simply 'The Imam'.\" Khomeini's cult of personality fills a central position in foreign- and domestically targeted Iranian publications. The methods used to create his personality cult have been compared to those used by such figures as Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong and Fidel Castro.An eight-century Hadith attributed to the Imam Musa al-Kazim that said \"A man will come out from Qom and he will summon people to the right path. There will rally to him people resembling pieces of iron, not to be shaken by violent winds, unsparing and relying on God\" was repeated in Iran as a tribute to Khomeini. (In Lebanon, however, this saying was also attributed to Musa al-Sadr.)Khomeini was the first and only Iranian cleric to be addressed as \"Imam\", a title hitherto reserved in Iran for the twelve infallible leaders of the early Shi'a. He was also associated with the Mahdi or 12th Imam of Shia belief in a number of ways. One of his titles was Na'eb-e Imam (Deputy to the Twelfth Imam). His enemies were often attacked as taghut and Mofsed-e-filarz, religious terms used for enemies of the Twelfth Imam. Many of the officials of the overthrown Shah's government executed by Revolutionary Courts were convicted of \"fighting against the Twelfth Imam\". When a deputy in the majlis asked Khomeini directly if he was the 'promised Mahdi', Khomeini did not answer, \"astutely\" neither confirming nor denying the title.\nAs the revolution gained momentum, even some non-supporters exhibited awe towards Khomeini, called him \"magnificently clear-minded, single-minded and unswerving.\" His image was as \"absolute, wise, and indispensable leader of the nation\":\nThe Imam, it was generally believed, had shown by his uncanny sweep to power, that he knew how to act in ways which others could not begin to understand. His timing was extraordinary, and his insight into the motivation of others, those around him as well as his enemies, could not be explained as ordinary knowledge. This emergent belief in Khomeini as a divinely guided figure was carefully fostered by the clerics who supported him and spoke up for him in front of the people.\nEven many secularists who firmly disapproved of his policies were said to feel the power of his \"messianic\" appeal. Comparing him to a father figure who retains the enduring loyalty even of children he disapproves of, journalist Afshin Molavi writes that defenses of Khomeini are \"heard in the most unlikely settings\":\n\nA whiskey-drinking professor told an American journalist that Khomeini brought pride back to Iranians. A women's rights activist told me that Khomeini was not the problem; it was his conservative allies who had directed him wrongly. A nationalist war veteran, who held Iran's ruling clerics in contempt, carried with him a picture of 'the Imam'.\nAnother journalist tells the story of listening to bitter criticism of the regime by an Iranian who tells her of his wish for his son to leave the country and who \"repeatedly\" makes the point \"that life had been better\" under the Shah. When his complaint is interrupted by news that \"the Imam\" \u2013 over 85 years old at the time and known to be ailing \u2013 might be dying, the critic becomes \"ashen faced\" and speechless, pronouncing the news to be \"terrible for my country.\"Non-Iranians were not immune from the effect. In 1982, after listening to a half-hour-long speech on the Quran by him, a Muslim scholar from South Africa, Sheikh Ahmad Deedat gushed:\n\n... the electric effect he had on everybody, his charisma, was amazing. You just look at the man and tears come down your cheek. You just look at him and you get tears.

He is known by various other names including Poyyil Pulavar, Mudharpavalar, Deivappulavar, Nayanar, Devar, Nanmukanar, Mathanubangi, Sennabbodhakar, and Perunavalar. There is negligible authentic information available about Valluvar's life. For all practical purposes, neither his actual name nor the original title of his work can be determined with certainty. The Kural text itself does not name its author. The name Thiruvalluvar was first mentioned in the later era Shaivite Hindu text known as the Tiruvalluva Maalai, also of unclear date. However, the Tiruvalluva Maalai does not mention anything about Valluvar's birth, family, caste or background. No other authentic pre-colonial texts have been found to support any legends about the life of Valluvar. Starting around early 19th century, numerous inconsistent legends on Valluvar in various Indian languages and English were published.\nVarious claims have been made regarding Valluvar's family background and occupation in the colonial era literature, all inferred from selective sections of his text or hagiographies published since the colonial era started in Tamil Nadu. One traditional version claims that he was a Paraiyar weaver. Another theory is that he must have been from the agricultural caste of Vellalars because he extols agriculture in his work. Another states he was an outcaste, born to a Pariah woman and a Brahmin father. Mu Raghava Iyengar speculated that \"valluva\" in his name is a variation of \"vallabha\", the designation of a royal officer. S. Vaiyapuri Pillai derived his name from \"valluvan\" (a Paraiyar caste of royal drummers) and theorized that he was \"the chief of the proclaiming boys analogous to a trumpet-major of an army\". The traditional biographies not only are inconsistent, but also contain incredulous claims about the author of the Kural text. Along with various versions of his birth circumstances, many state he went to a mountain and met the legendary Agastya and other sages. There are also accounts claiming that, during his return journey, Valluvar sat under a tree whose shadow sat still over him and did not move the entire day, he killed a demon, and many more. Scholars consider these and all associated aspects of these hagiographic stories to be fiction and ahistorical, a feature common to \"international and Indian folklore\". The alleged low birth, high birth and being a pariah in the traditional accounts are also doubtful. Traditionally, Valluvar is believed to have married to Vasuki and had a friend and a disciple named Elelasingan.In a manner similar to speculations of the author's biography, there has been much speculation about his religion with no historical evidence. In determining Valluvar's religion, the crucial test to be applied according to M. S. Purnalingam Pillai is to analyze what religious philosophy he has not condemned. He also adds that Valluvar has \"not said a word against\" the Saiva Siddhanta principles. The Kural text is aphoristic and non-denominational in nature and can be selectively interpreted in many ways. This has led almost every major religious group in India, including Christianity during the Colonial era, to claim the work and its author as one of their own. The 19th-century Christian missionary George Uglow Pope, for example, claimed that Valluvar must have lived in the 9th century CE, come in contact with Christian teachers such as Pantaenus of Alexandria, imbibed Christian ideas and peculiarities of Alexandrian teachers and then wrote the \"wonderful Kurral\" with an \"echo of the 'Sermon of the Mount'.\" This theory, however, is ahistorical and discredited. According to Zvelebil, the ethics and ideas in Valluvar's work are not Christian ethics. Albert Schweitzer hints that \"the dating of the Kural has suffered, along with so many other literary and historical dates, philosophies and mythologies of India, a severe mauling at the hands of the Christian Missionaries, anxious to post-date all irrefutable examples of religious maturity to the Christian era.\"Valluvar is thought to have belonged to either Jainism or Hinduism. This can be observed in his treatment of the concept of ahimsa or non-violence, which is the principal concept of both the religions. In the 1819 translation, Francis Whyte Ellis mentions that the Tamil community debates whether Valluvar was a Jain or Hindu. According to Zvelebil, Valluvar's treatment of the chapters on moral vegetarianism and non-killing reflects the Jain precepts. Certain epithets for God and ascetic values found in the text are found in Jainism, states Zvelebil. He theorizes that Valluvar was probably \"a learned Jain with eclectic leanings\", who was well acquainted with the earlier Tamil literature and also had knowledge of the Sanskrit texts. According to A. Chakravarthy Nainar, the Jaina tradition associates the work with Kunda Kunda Acharya, also known as Elachariyar in the Tamil region, the chief of the Southern Pataliputra Dravidian Sanghaat, who lived around the latter half of the first century BCE and the former half of the first century CE. Nevertheless, early Digambara or Svetambara Jaina texts do not mention Valluvar or the Kural text. The first claim of Valluvar as an authority appears in a 16th-century Jain text.\n\nValluvar's writings, according to scholars, also suggest that he might have belonged to Hinduism. Hindu teachers have mapped his teachings in the Kural literature to the teachings found in Hindu texts. The three parts that the Kural is divided into, namely, a\u1e5fam (virtue), poru\u1e37 (wealth) and inbam (love), aiming at attaining veedu (ultimate salvation), follow, respectively, the four foundations of Hinduism, namely, dharma, artha, kama and moksha. While the text extols the virtue of non-violence, it also dedicates many of 700 poru\u1e37 couplets to various aspects of statecraft and warfare in a manner similar to the Hindu text Arthasastra. For example, according to the text, an army has a duty to kill in battle, and a king must execute criminals for justice. Valluvar's mentioning of God Vishnu in couplets 610 and 1103 and Goddess Lakshmi in couplets 167, 408, 519, 565, 568, 616, and 617 suggests the Vaishnavite beliefs of the author. P. R. Natarajan lists at least 24 different usage of Hindu origin in 29 different couplets across the Kural text. According to Purnalingam Pillai, who is known for his critique of Brahminism, a rational analysis of the Kural text suggests that Valluvar was a Hindu, and not a Jain. Matthieu Ricard believes Valluvar belonged to the Shaivite tradition of South India. According to Thomas Manninezhath \u2013 a theology scholar who grew up in South India, the Tirukku\u1e5fa\u1e37 is believed by the natives to reflect Advaita Vedanta philosophy and teaches an \"Advaitic way of life\".Notwithstanding these debates, Valluvar is praised by scholars for his innate nature to select the virtues found in all the known works and present them in a manner that is common and acceptable to everyone. The author is remembered and cherished for his universal secular values, and his treatise has been called Ulaga Podhu Marai (the universal scripture).", "hasanswer": false}]}

D.\" Harriman, \"the last of the Robber Barons\", is obsessed with being the first to travel to\u2014and possess\u2014the Moon. He asks his business partner, George Strong, and other tycoons to invest in the venture. Most dismiss Harriman's plans as foolhardy: Nuclear rocket fuel is scarce as the space station that produces it blew up, also destroying the only existing spaceship. The necessary technology for a chemical-fueled rocket stretches the boundaries of current engineering. The endeavor is both incredibly costly and of uncertain profitability. One skeptic offers to sell \"all of my interest in the Moon...for fifty cents\"; Harriman accepts and tries to buy the other associates' interests as well. Strong and two others agree to back his plans.\nThe technical problems are solvable with money and talent. To solve the tougher financial problems, Harriman exploits commercial and political rivalries. He implies to the Moka-Coka company, for example, that rival soft drink maker 6+ plans to turn the Moon into a massive billboard, using a rocket to scatter black dust on the surface in patterns. To an anti-Communist associate, he suggests that the Russians may print the hammer and sickle across the face of the Moon if they get to it first. To a television network, he offers the Moon as a reliable and uncensorable broadcasting station.\nHarriman seeks to avoid government ownership of the Moon. As it passes directly overhead only in a narrow band north and south of the equator, he uses a legal principle that states that property rights extend to infinity above a land parcel. On that basis, Mexico, Central and parts of South America, and other countries in those latitudes around the world, have a claim on the Moon. The United States also has a claim due to Florida and Texas. By arranging for many countries to assert their rights Harriman persuades the United Nations to, as a compromise, assign management of the Moon to his company.\nMoney remains the main difficulty. Harriman liquidates his assets, risks bankruptcy, damages his marriage, and raises funds in numerous legitimate and semi-legitimate ways; \"I\", he says, \"would cheat, lie, steal, beg, bribe\u2014do anything to accomplish what we have accomplished\". Children donate money for a promise of all contributors' names engraved on a plaque left on the Moon. The names, however, will be microscopic in size. Harriman sells land and naming rights to craters, and plans to sell postal covers canceled on the Moon to collectors. He starts rumors that diamonds exist in moondust, intending to secretly place gems in the rocket to convince people that the rumors are true. Harriman will strenuously deny that the diamonds are from the Moon, being merely part of a scientific experiment; he expects people not to believe him, but he will not be guilty of actual fraud.\nHarriman wants to be on the first flight of the Pioneer but the ship only has room for one pilot, Leslie LeCroix. The multistage rocket launches from Peterson Field, near Colorado Springs, Colorado, lands on the Moon, and returns to Earth. Harriman is the first to open the rocket's hatch; the canceled postal covers were left behind to save weight and he needs to get them aboard surreptitiously. While doing so, he asks LeCroix for the \"lunar\" diamonds. The pilot complies, then produces real lunar diamonds as well.\nAs Harriman predicted, once the first flight succeeds, many seek to invest in his venture to make more flights using a catapult launcher built on Pikes Peak. The next flight will begin a lunar colony. Harriman intends to be on the ship, but the majority owners of the venture object to his presence on the flight; he is too valuable to the company to risk in space. The rocket leaves without Harriman, who \"looks as Moses must have looked, when he gazed out over the promised land\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Azerbaijan has been ruled by the Aliyev political family and the New Azerbaijan Party (Yeni Az\u0259rbaycan Partiyas\u0131, YAP) established by Heydar Aliyev continuously since 1993. It is categorised as \"not free\" by Freedom House, who ranked it 9/100 on Global Freedom Score in 2022, calling it a \"consolidated authoritarian regime\".The structural formation of Azerbaijan's political system was completed by the adoption of the new Constitution on 12 November 1995. According to Article 23 of the Constitution, the state symbols of the Azerbaijan Republic are the flag, the coat of arms, and the national anthem. The state power in Azerbaijan is limited only by law for internal issues, but international affairs are also limited by international agreements' provisions.The Constitution of Azerbaijan states that it is a presidential republic with three branches of power \u2013 Executive, Legislative, and Judicial. The legislative power is held by the unicameral National Assembly and the Supreme National Assembly in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The Parliament of Azerbaijan, called Milli Majlis, consists of 125 deputies elected based on majority vote, with a term of five years for each elected member. The elections are held every five years, on the first Sunday of November. The Parliament is not responsible for the formation of the government, but the Constitution requires the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers by Milli Majlis. The New Azerbaijan Party, and independents loyal to the ruling government, currently hold almost all of the Parliament's 125 seats. During the 2010 Parliamentary election, the opposition parties, Musavat and Azerbaijani Popular Front Party, failed to win a single seat. European observers found numerous irregularities in the run-up to the election and on election day.\nThe executive power is held by the President, who is elected for a seven-year term by direct elections, and the Prime Minister. The president is authorized to form the Cabinet, a collective executive body accountable to both the President and the National Assembly. The Cabinet of Azerbaijan consists primarily of the prime minister, his deputies, and ministers. The 8th Government of Azerbaijan is the administration in its current formation. The president does not have the right to dissolve the National Assembly but has the right to veto its decisions. To override the presidential veto, the parliament must have a majority of 95 votes. The judicial power is vested in the Constitutional Court, Supreme Court, and the Economic Court. The president nominates the judges in these courts.Azerbaijan's system of governance nominally can be called two-tiered. The top or highest tier of the government is the Executive Power headed by President. The President appoints the Cabinet of Ministers and other high-ranking officials. The Local Executive Authority is merely a continuation of Executive Power. The Provision determines the legal status of local state administration in Azerbaijan on Local Executive Authority (Yerli Icra Hakimiyati), adopted 16 June 1999.

The series was produced by July Moon Productions, Kicked to the Curb Productions, That Kid Ed Productions, Anonymous Content and Paramount Television, with Yorkey and Diana Son serving as showrunners for the first season, and Yorkey for the rest of the series. Dylan Minnette and Katherine Langford star as Clay Jensen and Hannah Baker, respectively, alongside an ensemble cast. A film from Universal Pictures based on Thirteen Reasons Why began development in February 2011, with Selena Gomez set to star as Hannah, before being shelved in favor of a television series and Netflix ordering an adaptation as a limited series in October 2015, with Gomez instead serving as an executive producer.The first season was released on Netflix on March 31, 2017. It received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its themes, emotional weight, subject matter, character development and acting, particularly the performances of Minnette and Langford. For her performance, Langford received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Drama. However, its graphic depiction of issues such as suicide, sexual assault, bullying, and rape (along with other mature content) prompted concerns from mental health professionals. In response, Netflix added a warning card in March 2018 that plays at the start of each episode warning viewers about the themes of each season. In July 2019, Netflix edited out the suicide scene in the first-season finale.In May 2017, Netflix renewed 13 Reasons Why for a second season due to the success of the initial 13 episodes; the second season was released on May 18, 2018, and was met with generally negative critical reviews. Coinciding with the release of the second season, Netflix released a video with the cast that cautioned viewers on some of the topics covered in the show and provided a support website with crisis numbers for people affected by depression, anxiety and other mental health issues. A third season was ordered in June 2018 and was released on August 23, 2019. In August 2019, the series was renewed for a fourth and final season, which was released on June 5, 2020. The final two seasons were also met with a negative critical response.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She elucidates her concept of \"Men in Time,\" \"Men above Time,\" and \"Men against Time\" using the lives of Genghis Khan, Akhnaton, and Adolf Hitler respectively. Genghis Khan is used as an example of a \"Man in Time\" who exhibits Lightning (destructive) qualities and furthers historical decay. Akhnaton is used to illustrate a \"Man above Time\" who exhibits Sun (creative/life-affirming) qualities and seeks to transcend the process of historical decay. Hitler is used to illustrate a \"Man against Time\" who exhibits both Lightning and Sun qualities (destructive power harnessed for a life-affirming purpose) and seek to fight historical decay by using violence, Dark-Age methods to achieve a Golden Age state of existence.

Bob Quinn is a film director who produced many documentaries and fiction films through the Irish language on limited budgets, including the first Irish-language feature film Poit\u00edn starring Niall T\u00f3ib\u00edn, Cyril Cusack and Donal McCann.The three writers proposed small temporary buildings for Gaeltacht regional television services broadcasting a limited number of hours each night with programming coming from each of the Gaeltacht regions around the country.RT\u00c9 and the Irish government had sought to improve the availability of Irish-language programming on RT\u00c9 services. In 1972, RT\u00c9 Raidi\u00f3 na Gaeltachta (RnaG) was set up to provide Irish-language radio services across the country. All radio and television services provided by RT\u00c9 provided some Irish-language programming.\nIn 1980, a new group called Coiste ar son Teilif\u00eds Gaeltachta (The Committee for Irish-Language Television) was set up. In 1987 they set up the pirate television station Teilif\u00eds na Gaeltachta, after years of delays, including the sudden death of their technician who was to build the transmitter. Eighteen hours of live and pre-recorded programming was broadcast between 2 and 5 November 1987. The transmitter was built at a cost of IR\u00a34,000 through donations from local Gaeltacht communities. In December 1988, further broadcasts were transmitted from three different sites, broadcasting pre-recorded programming.The movement for a national Irish-language television service continued to gain momentum afterwards. In 1989, Ciar\u00e1n \u00d3 Feinneadha, one of the members of Coiste ar son Teilif\u00eds Gaeltachta, moved to Dublin and set up a similar organisation in the capital called Feachtas N\u00e1isi\u00fanta Teilif\u00edse (FTN). FTN outlined their demands:\n\nA television station to be set up in the Gaeltacht regions serving the Gaeltacht and Irish speakers across the country.\nIt should be linked to RT\u00c9, but independent from both editorial and organisational points of view.\nA special authority set up to run it with representatives from RT\u00c9, the Department of Communications, and \u00dadar\u00e1s na Gaeltachta.It was also suggested that the cap on advertising on RT\u00c9 be removed and the additional funds be designated for the new services. Ray Burke had limited the advertising minutes on RT\u00c9 a few years previously. Hence, there would be no cost to the Exchequer, and funding would also come from the National Lottery and the television Licence.FTN suggested two hours of programming each day, with the rest of the broadcast hours used for Open University type programming.In the early 1990s, Irish language programmes amounted to only 5% of total programming broadcast by RT\u00c9, and was reduced significantly during the summer months. Programmes included Echo Island for children, and current affairs programme Cursa\u00ed. Before the birth of TG4, RT\u00c9 had suggested the use of RT\u00c9 Two's prime-time schedule for Irish-language programming.\nThe outgoing coalition parties of Fianna F\u00e1il and the Progressive Democrats called for the establishment of an Irish language television station in their 1989 manifestos. Fianna F\u00e1il stated that they would set up an Irish language television service in the Galway Gaeltacht that would service the whole country. The PDs also looked for the setting up of what they called \"Teilif\u00eds na Gaeltacha\" (TnaG). The Green Party's manifesto from 1987 also called for the establishment of such a channel.Fianna F\u00e1il entered into coalition with The Labour Party in 1993 and as part of their programme for government they included the setting up of TnaG. Taoiseach Albert Reynolds appointed Michael D. Higgins as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and responsibility for broadcasting was given to this department. This government left office in 1994 and was replaced by the Rainbow Coalition. Michael D. Higgins was re-appointed as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht under Taoiseach John Bruton.

Edmund Wilson described the writing as \"of the first distinction\", writing that the bullfight scenes were like Francisco Goya paintings, that the author \"had almost invented a form of his own\", and it had \"more artistic dignity than any written by an American about the period of the war.\"The 1925 edition of In Our Time is considered one of Hemingway's masterpieces. Reviewers and critics noticed, and the collection received positive reviews on its publication. The New York Times described the language as \"fibrous and athletic, colloquial and fresh, hard and clean, his very prose seems to have an organic being of its own\". A reviewer for Time wrote, \"Ernest Hemingway is somebody; a new honest un-'literary' transcriber of life \u2013 a Writer.\" Reviewing for The Bookman, F.

Benson attributes the neglect to various factors. The Sun Also Rises, published the next year, is considered the more important book followed fairly rapidly by the popular A Farewell to Arms two years after in 1928; critics' general assumption seemed to be that Hemingway's talent lay in writing prose rather than \"sophisticated, complex design\"; and In Our Time stories were combined with subsequent collections in the publication of The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories in 1938, drawing the critics' attention away from the book as an entity, toward the individual stories.

{"id": "50_117", "question": "Who is the author of Children of Virtue and Vengeance?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_21019", "text": "The form of the play differs from many other Greek tragedies by its simplicity. Most scenes involve only Medea and someone else. The Chorus, here representing the women of Corinth, is usually involved alongside them. The simple encounters highlight Medea's skill and determination in manipulating powerful male figures. The play is also the only Greek tragedy in which a kin-killer makes it unpunished to the end of the play, and the only one about child-killing in which the deed is performed in cold blood as opposed to in a state of temporary madness. Medea's \"rebellion\" is that which shakes the very world everyone must inhabit. Her rebellion tells of her past history, the goddess-like figure denigrated and ultimately dethroned gives lead to why she would act the way she does. Euripides displays Medea as an archetype. As a result, he reinforces the modern stereotype as a woman to be the devourer of men and children, instead of Medea, the great mother wronged.Euripides' characterization of Medea exhibits the inner emotions of passion, love, and vengeance. \nThe character of Medea has variously been interpreted both as fulfilling her role of \"mother and wife\" and as acting as a \"proto-feminist\". \nFeminist readings have interpreted the play as either a \"sympathetic exploration\" of the \"disadvantages of being a woman in a patriarchal society\", or as an expression of misogynist attitudes. \nIn conflict with this sympathetic undertone (or reinforcing a more negative reading) is Medea's barbarian identity, which some argue could antagonize a 5th-century BC Greek audience.It can be argued that in the play Euripides portrays Medea out to be an enraged woman who kills her children to get revenge on her husband Jason because of his betrayal of their marriage. Medea is often cited as an example of the \"madwoman in the attic\" trope, in which women who defy societal norms are portrayed as mentally unstable. Although, Medea is not the only character in the play to use deception; other characters, such as Jason and Creon, also use lies and manipulation. A competing interpretation is that Medea kills her children out of kindness because she cares and worries for them and their well-being. Once Medea commits to her plan to kill Creon and Jason's new bride, she knows her children are in danger of being murdered. Medea is not paranoid. In another version of the myth, the people of Corinth kill her children to avenge the deaths of Creon and his daughter Glauke. At this time in myth and history, helping one's friends and hurting one's enemies was considered a virtue. Thus, by this ethic, the Corinthians will do right by avenging their king and princess. Conversely, a focus on Medea's rage leads to the interpretation that \"Medea becomes the personification of vengeance, with her humanity 'mortified' and 'sloughed off'\" (Cowherd, 129). Medea's heritage places her in a position more typically reserved for the male in her time. Hers is the power of the sun, appropriately symbolized by her great radiance, tremendous heat and boundless passion.  In this view Medea is inhuman and her suffering is self-inflicted just as Jason argues in his debate with her. And yet, if we see events through Medea's eyes, we view a wife intent on vengeance and a mother concerned about her children's safety and the life they can be expected to live. Thus, Medea as wife kills Creon and Glauke in the act of vengeance. Medea as a mother thinks that her children will be better off killed by her kind hand than left to suffer at the hands of an enemy, intent on vengeance. And so, Medea saves her children from this brutality and a worse fate by killing them herself, providing them with as peaceful an outcome as she can.\nEuripides\u2019 tragic character, Medea, is often described as having a \u201cheroic temper,\u201d (Lush, 2014). With this temper, the motive behind much of Medea\u2019s behavior is to avoid the laughter of her enemies, \u201ceven at the cost of decisions that contradict self-interest, personal safety, or strongly held moral beliefs,\u201d (Lush, 2014). Although some may say that her motive is jealousy over Jason\u2019s new bride, Glauce, such reasoning does not fully explain the severity of Medea\u2019s actions. Medea\u2019s temperament suggests that she was more embarrassed than she was angry. She was unwilling to let her enemies, in this case Jason and his new wife, be happy or look down upon her. Medea denied that \u201cher enemies [would] cause her pain and rejoice,\u201d and stated that her priority was to \u201cavoid her enemies\u2019 derision,\u201d (Lush, 2014). Although the murder of her children would cause her pain, Medea\u2019s temperament caused her to prioritize Jason\u2019s unhappiness over anything else. \nLush, B. (2014).

They leave with Moiraine and her companion, the Warder Lan Mandragoran, and are joined by Egwene al'Vere, in whom Moiraine sees a potential Aes Sedai; the gleeman Thom Merrilin; and later the Wisdom Nynaeve al'Meara, a healer who learns she can also channel the One Power. They are pursued by increasing numbers of Trollocs, led by deadly, eyeless Fades, and are separated fleeing the cursed, abandoned city of Shadar Logoth. At the Eye of the World, a sacred pool of untainted saidin, Rand's defeat of the Forsaken Aginor and Ba'alzamon convinces Moiraine that he is the prophesied Dragon Reborn.From then, the story expands and protagonist Rand, as well as the other characters, are frequently split into different groups, pursuing different missions or agendas aimed at furthering the cause of the Dragon Reborn, sometimes thousands of miles apart. Broadly speaking, the original group of characters from the Two Rivers make new allies, gain experience, and become figures of some influence and authority. As they struggle to unite the western kingdoms against the Dark One's forces, their task is complicated by rulers of the nations who refuse to give up their authority and by factions such as the Children of the Light, who do not believe in the prophecies, and the Seanchan, the people of a long-lost colony of Artur Hawkwing's empire across the western ocean who have returned, believing it is their destiny to conquer the world. The Aes Sedai also become divided between those who believe the Dragon Reborn should be strictly controlled and those who believe he must lead them into battle as he did in the earlier war. As the story expands, new characters representing different factions are introduced; although this expansion of the narrative allows the sheer scale of the growing struggle to be effectively depicted, it has been criticized for slowing the pace of the novels and sometimes reducing the appearances of the original or main cast to extended cameos.\nBy the sixth novel, Lord of Chaos (1994), it has become clear that the Last Battle, triggered when the Dark One is able to exert its influence directly on the world once more, is imminent, as only three Seals (keys to the Dark One's prison) are intact.

Lady Capulet and Juliet's Nurse try to persuade Juliet to accept Paris's courtship.\nMeanwhile, Benvolio talks with his cousin Romeo, Montague's son, about Romeo's recent depression. Benvolio discovers that it stems from unrequited infatuation for a girl named Rosaline, one of Capulet's nieces. Persuaded by Benvolio and Mercutio, Romeo attends the ball at the Capulet house in hopes of meeting Rosaline. However, Romeo instead meets and falls in love with Juliet. Juliet's cousin, Tybalt, is enraged at Romeo for sneaking into the ball but is stopped from killing Romeo by Juliet's father, who does not wish to shed blood in his house. After the ball, in what is now famously known as the \"balcony scene\", Romeo sneaks into the Capulet orchard and overhears Juliet at her window vowing her love to him in spite of her family's hatred of the Montagues. Romeo makes himself known to her, and they agree to be married. With the help of Friar Laurence, who hopes to reconcile the two families through their children's union, they are secretly married the next day.\nTybalt, meanwhile, still incensed that Romeo had sneaked into the Capulet ball, challenges him to a duel. Romeo, now considering Tybalt his kinsman, refuses to fight. Mercutio is offended by Tybalt's insolence, as well as Romeo's \"vile submission\", and accepts the duel on Romeo's behalf.

She becomes mortal and eventually dies. The king believes that eventually, her spirit will return to the underworld, so he builds labyrinths, which act as portals, around the world in preparation for her return.\nIn 1944 Francoist Spain, ten-year-old Ofelia travels with her pregnant mother Carmen to meet Captain Vidal, her new stepfather. Vidal believes strongly in Falangism and has been assigned to hunt down republican rebels. A large stick insect, which Ofelia believes to be a fairy, leads Ofelia into an ancient stone labyrinth, but she is stopped by Vidal's housekeeper Mercedes, who is secretly supporting her brother Pedro and other rebels. That night, the insect appears in Ofelia's bedroom, where it transforms into a fairy and leads her through the labyrinth. There, she meets a faun, who believes she is the reincarnation of Princess Moanna. He gives her a book and tells her she will find in it three tasks to complete in order for her to acquire immortality and return to her kingdom.\nOfelia completes the first task \u2014 retrieving a key from the belly of a giant toad \u2014 but becomes worried about her mother, whose condition is worsening. The faun gives Ofelia a mandrake root, instructing her to keep it under Carmen's bed and regularly supply it with blood, which seems to ease Carmen's illness. Accompanied by three fairy guides and equipped with a piece of magic chalk, Ofelia then completes the second task \u2014 retrieving a dagger from the lair of the Pale Man, a child-eating monster. Warned not to consume anything there, she eats two grapes, awakening the Pale Man. He devours two of the fairies and chases Ofelia, but she manages to escape. Infuriated at her disobedience, the faun refuses to give Ofelia the third task.\nDuring this time, Ofelia becomes aware of Vidal's ruthlessness in the course of hunting down the rebels. After killing two local farmers, Vidal interrogates and tortures a captive rebel. He asks Doctor Ferreiro to tend to the captive, whom Ferreiro then euthanises at the rebel's own urging. Realising that Ferreiro is a rebel collaborator, Vidal kills him. Vidal later catches Ofelia tending to the mandrake root, which he considers delusional. Carmen agrees and throws the root into the fire. She immediately develops painful contractions and dies giving birth to Vidal's son.\nA discovered spy, Mercedes tries to escape with Ofelia, but they are caught. Ofelia is locked in her bedroom, while Mercedes is taken to be interrogated. Mercedes frees herself, and stabs Vidal non-lethally in her escape to re-join the rebels. The faun, having changed his mind about giving Ofelia a chance to perform the third task, returns and tells her to bring her newborn brother into the labyrinth to complete it. Ofelia retrieves the baby and flees into the labyrinth. Vidal pursues her as the rebels launch an attack on the outpost. \nOfelia meets the faun at the centre of the labyrinth. The faun suggests drawing a small amount of the baby's blood, as completing the third task and opening the portal to the underworld requires the blood of an innocent, but Ofelia refuses to harm her brother. Vidal finds her talking to the faun, whom he cannot see. The faun leaves, and Vidal takes the baby from Ofelia's arms before shooting her. Vidal returns to the labyrinth's entrance, where he is surrounded by rebels, including Mercedes and Pedro. Knowing that he will be killed, he hands the baby to Mercedes, asking that his son be told the time of his father's death. Mercedes replies that his son will not even know his name, before Pedro shoots Vidal dead.\nMercedes enters the labyrinth and comforts a dying Ofelia. Drops of Ofelia's blood fall down the centre of the spiral stone staircase onto an altar. Ofelia, well dressed and uninjured, then appears in a golden throne room. The King of the underworld tells her that, by choosing to spill her own blood rather than that of another, she passed the final test. The faun praises Ofelia for her choice, addressing her as \"Your Highness\". The Queen of the underworld, her mother, invites Ofelia to sit next to her father and rule at his side. Back in the stone labyrinth, Ofelia smiles as she dies.\nThe epilogue completes the tale of Princess Moanna, stating that she returned to the Underworld, ruled with kindness and justice for many centuries, and left little traces of her time in the human realm, \"visible only to those who know where to look.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

He would tend to her, reading aloud from drafts that would eventually be worked into his unfinished novel Stephen Hero. During her final days, she unsuccessfully tried to get him to make his confession and to take communion. She died on 13 August. Afterwards, Joyce and Stanislaus refused to kneel with other members of the family praying at her bedside. John Joyce's drinking and abusiveness increased in the months following her death, and the family began to fall apart. Joyce spent much of his time carousing with Gogarty and his medical school colleagues, and tried to scrape together a living by reviewing books.Joyce's life began to change when he met Nora Barnacle on 10 June 1904. She was a twenty-year-old woman from Galway city, who was working in Dublin as a chambermaid. They had their first outing together on 16 June 1904, walking through the Dublin suburb of Ringsend, where Nora masturbated him. This event was commemorated as the date for the action of Ulysses, known in popular culture as \"Bloomsday\" in honour of the novel's main character Leopold Bloom. This began a relationship that continued for thirty-seven years until Joyce died. Soon after this outing, Joyce, who had been carousing with his colleagues, approached a young woman in St Stephen's Green and was beaten up by her companion. He was picked up and dusted off by an acquaintance of his father's, Alfred H. Hunter, who took him into his home to tend to his injuries. Hunter, who was rumoured to be a Jew and to have an unfaithful wife, became one of the models for Leopold Bloom, the protagonist of Ulysses.Joyce was a talented tenor and explored becoming a musical performer. On 8 May 1904, he was a contestant in the Feis Ceoil, an Irish music competition for promising composers, instrumentalists and singers. In the months before the contest, Joyce took singing lessons with two voice instructors, Benedetto Palmieri and Vincent O'Brien. He paid the entry fee by pawning some of his books. For the contest, Joyce had to sing three songs. He did well with the first two, but when he was told he had to sight read the third, he refused. Joyce won the third-place medal anyway. After the contest, Palmieri wrote Joyce that Luigi Denza, the composer of the popular song \"Funicul\u00ec, Funicul\u00e0\" who was the judge for the contest, spoke highly of his voice and would have given him first place but for the sight-reading and lack of sufficient training. Palmieri even offered to give Joyce free singing lessons afterwards. Joyce refused the lessons, but kept singing in Dublin concerts that year. His performance at a concert given on 27 August may have solidified Nora's devotion to him.Throughout 1904, Joyce sought to develop his literary reputation. On 7 January he attempted to publish a prose work examining aesthetics called A Portrait of the Artist, but it was rejected by the intellectual journal Dana. He then reworked it into a fictional novel of his youth that he called Stephen Hero that he labored over for years but eventually abandoned. He wrote a satirical poem called \"The Holy Office\", which parodied W. B. Yeats's poem \"To Ireland in the Coming Times\" and once more mocked the Irish Literary Revival. It too was rejected for publication; this time for being \"unholy\". He wrote the collection of poems Chamber Music at this time; which was also rejected. He did publish three poems, one in Dana  and two in The Speaker, and George William Russell published three of Joyce's short stories in the Irish Homestead. These stories\u2014\"The Sisters\", \"Eveline\", and \"After the Race\"\u2014were the beginnings of Dubliners.In September 1904, Joyce was having difficulties finding a place to live and moved into a Martello tower near Dublin, which Gogarty was renting.\nWithin a week, Joyce left when Gogarty and another roommate, Dermot Chenevix Trench, fired a pistol in the middle of the night at some pans hanging directly over Joyce's bed. With the help of funds from Lady Gregory and a few other acquaintances, Joyce and Nora left Ireland less than a month later.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "50_142", "question": "Who is the author of \"How to Create a Mind\"?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_20601", "text": "The portrayal of Socrates in the Symposium (for instance his refusal to give in to Alcibiades' sexual advances) is consistent with the account of Socrates put forward by Xenophon, who also wrote his own Symposium, and the theories that Socrates defends throughout the Platonic corpus. Plato shows off his master as a man of high moral standards, unstirred by baser urges and fully committed to the study and practice of proper self-government in both individuals and communities (the so-called \"royal science\"). The dialogue's ending contrasts Socrates' intellectual and emotional self-mastery with Alcibiades' debauchery and lack of moderation to explain the latter's reckless political career, disastrous military campaigns, and eventual demise. Alcibiades is corrupted by his physical beauty and its advantages; he ultimately fails to ascend to the Form of Beauty through philosophy.\nMartha Nussbaum considers the possibility that the Symposium is intended to criticize Socrates and his philosophy, and to reject certain aspects of his behavior, and that Plato intends to portray Socratic philosophy as something that has lost touch with the actual individual as it devoted itself to abstract principles.One critic, James Arieti, considers that the Symposium resembles a drama, with emotional and dramatic events occurring especially when Alcibiades crashes the banquet. Arieti suggests that it should be studied more as a drama, with a focus on character and actions, and less as an exploration of philosophical ideas. This suggests that the characters speak, as in a play, not as the author, but as themselves. This theory, Arieti has found, reveals how much each of the speakers of the Symposium resembles the god, Eros, that they each are describing. It may be Plato's point to suggest that when humankind talks about god, they are drawn towards creating that god in their own image.Andrew Dalby considers the opening pages of the Symposium the best depiction in any ancient Greek source of the way texts are transmitted by oral tradition without writing.  It shows how an oral text may have no simple origin, and how it can be passed along by repeated tellings, and by different narrators, and how it can be sometimes verified, and sometimes corrupted. The story of the symposium is being told by Apollodorus to his friend.  Apollodorus was not himself at the banquet, but heard the story from Aristodemus, a man who was there.  Also, Apollodorus was able to confirm parts of the story with Socrates himself, who was one of the speakers at the banquet. In addition, the story that Socrates narrates when it is his turn to speak was told to Socrates by Diotima.Walter Hamilton remarks that Plato takes care to portray Alcibiades and Socrates and their relationship in a way that makes it clear that Socrates had not been a bad influence on Alcibiades. Plato does this to free his teacher from the guilt of corrupting the minds of prominent youths, which had, in fact, earned Socrates the death sentence in 399 BC.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Serge reveals that he was pressured to implicate Gustave by the real killer, Dmitri, and that Madame D. had a missing second will, which would only take effect should she be murdered. Jopling arrives and kills Serge, leaving Gustave and Zero without a witness, then tries to flee. After a chase through the snow, Gustave is left dangling of a cliff at the mercy of Jopling. Before it is too late, Zero rescues Gustave by pushing Jopling off the cliff, and the two men continue their escape from swarming Zubrowkan troops led by Henckels.\nGustave, Zero, and Agatha return to the Grand Budapest to find it converted into a fascist headquarters by Dmitri. Agatha sneaks in to retrieve the painting but is spotted by Dmitri. Gustave and Zero rush in to save Agatha, but Dmitri shoots at them and initiates a melee with Zubrowkan troops, which Henckels stops. At the back of the painting, Agatha finds Madame D.'s second will, which makes Gustave the hotel owner. He is exonerated in court, while Dmitri becomes the main suspect and flees the country. Over time, Gustave becomes one of the wealthiest Zubrowkans, and Zero and Agatha are wed. However, while the three are later traveling by train, soldiers come by and destroy Zero's refugee documents; Gustave tries to fend them off but is killed. His own will bequeaths the hotel and his fortune to Zero. He maintains the Grand Budapest up to its eventual demolition in memory of Agatha who, like their infant son, died from Prussian Grippe.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The woman reveals herself to be Moiraine Damodred, one of the Aes Sedai, and warns that the servants of the Dark One are seeking one of three young men from the village: Rand al'Thor, Perrin Aybara and Matrim Cauthon. They leave with Moiraine and her companion, the Warder Lan Mandragoran, and are joined by Egwene al'Vere, in whom Moiraine sees a potential Aes Sedai; the gleeman Thom Merrilin; and later the Wisdom Nynaeve al'Meara, a healer who learns she can also channel the One Power. They are pursued by increasing numbers of Trollocs, led by deadly, eyeless Fades, and are separated fleeing the cursed, abandoned city of Shadar Logoth. At the Eye of the World, a sacred pool of untainted saidin, Rand's defeat of the Forsaken Aginor and Ba'alzamon convinces Moiraine that he is the prophesied Dragon Reborn.From then, the story expands and protagonist Rand, as well as the other characters, are frequently split into different groups, pursuing different missions or agendas aimed at furthering the cause of the Dragon Reborn, sometimes thousands of miles apart. Broadly speaking, the original group of characters from the Two Rivers make new allies, gain experience, and become figures of some influence and authority. As they struggle to unite the western kingdoms against the Dark One's forces, their task is complicated by rulers of the nations who refuse to give up their authority and by factions such as the Children of the Light, who do not believe in the prophecies, and the Seanchan, the people of a long-lost colony of Artur Hawkwing's empire across the western ocean who have returned, believing it is their destiny to conquer the world. The Aes Sedai also become divided between those who believe the Dragon Reborn should be strictly controlled and those who believe he must lead them into battle as he did in the earlier war. As the story expands, new characters representing different factions are introduced; although this expansion of the narrative allows the sheer scale of the growing struggle to be effectively depicted, it has been criticized for slowing the pace of the novels and sometimes reducing the appearances of the original or main cast to extended cameos.\nBy the sixth novel, Lord of Chaos (1994), it has become clear that the Last Battle, triggered when the Dark One is able to exert its influence directly on the world once more, is imminent, as only three Seals (keys to the Dark One's prison) are intact. Once the remaining Seals break, the Dark One will be free to touch the world. The Last Battle, Tarmon Gai'don, is depicted in the fourteenth and final novel in the series, A Memory of Light (2013).", "hasanswer": false}]}

Nefret decides she will stay in England to study while the Emersons return to Egypt as usual in the fall, and Walter and Evelyn Emerson glady take her in. Ramses also decides to stay in England, as his crush on Nefret becomes more obvious to his mother, but to no one else.\nSo Amelia and the Professor sail east, to begin a new season with a new project in the place where they met, Amarna - the complete clearing of an entire archaeological site. Amelia's hopes that this will be a second honeymoon for them are soon dashed. First she is abducted and rescued by Emerson. Then Emerson is attacked and kidnapped \u2014 but no ransom demand or explanation is forthcoming. Amelia, Abdullah, and their circle of friends scour Luxor for any sign of Emerson, with the help of Cyrus Vandergelt, who appears on the scene just when Amelia needs him most.\nWhen Adbullah finally finds Emerson, imprisoned in a backyard shed, Amelia finds out that his captor wants information about their previous season's travels and the possibility of a lost Meroitic civilization with artifacts and treasures to exploit.\nUnfortunately for the kidnapper, Emerson is the victim of amnesia and does not know anything about the Lost Oasis. Unfortunately for Amelia, it turns out Emerson does not remember her either \u2014 and is just as annoyed by her as when they first met. (See Crocodile on the Sandbank.)\nBack in England, Ramses and Nefret are targeted for abduction, with each attempt thwarted by Evelyn and Walter, and by the two victims. Ramses' harrowing letters do not add to Amelia's peace of mind. Meanwhile, Cyrus is beginning to look at Amelia with more affection than she wants, going so far as to propose marriage. She rejects him, and he continues to assist her. Two troubles are tied to a symbolic snake and crocodile. The dog is real, howling in pain in a house they pass en route to a dig. Emerson lets the dog out, though Amelia sees it as a trap; she blocks the dog from her husband and it bites her. They fear the dog is rabid; Emerson cauterizes the bite on her foot. Others pursue the dog to find it had been tortured not rabid; it was a trap. Amelia is carried often as her foot is painful and slow to heal.\nEmerson sets up a trap to lure his attacker. From the abduction, he knows it is Vincey. Cyrus is armed and supplies two armed guards. They meet in a cave, Emerson, Amelia, Cyrus, and Vincey, with guns. Amelia and Emerson each want to shield the other. Emerson shoots Vincey fatally, while Vincey turns, aiming at the fast moving Amelia but killing Cyrus. Cyrus\u2019s guards had not guarded; instead they blocked Abdullah from responding to the initial attack outside the cave.\nAfterwards, in Luxor, the real Cyrus appears, having been kidnapped by the Master Criminal, Sethos that master of disguise, who now lies dead in the cave.

The morning papers carried the announcement that the President and his wife would be attending the theater that evening.  At one point, Mary developed a headache and was inclined to stay home, but Lincoln told her he must attend because newspapers had announced that he would. She sat with her husband watching the comic play Our American Cousin at Ford's Theatre, along with their guests Henry Rathbone and Clara Harris. During the third act, Mr. Lincoln and Mrs. Lincoln drew closer together, holding hands while enjoying the play. Mary whispered to her husband, who was holding her hand, \"What will Miss Harris think of my hanging on to you so?\" The president smiled and replied, \"She won't think anything about it\". That was the last conversation the Lincolns ever had. Five minutes later, at about 10:15 pm, President Lincoln was shot by John Wilkes Booth. She was holding Abraham's hand when Booth's bullet struck the back of his head. Mrs. Lincoln accompanied her mortally wounded husband across the street to the Petersen House, where he was taken to a back bedroom and laid crosswise on the bed there, where Lincoln's Cabinet was summoned, except William Seward, who had been seriously attacked by Lewis Powell, just as Booth was about to carry out his assassination at Ford's Theater, several minutes earlier. Their oldest son, Robert, sat with Lincoln throughout the night and to the following morning \u2013 Saturday, April 15, 1865. At one point, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton ordered Mary from the room as she was so unhinged with grief.President Lincoln remained in a coma for approximately nine hours. He died at 7:22 a.m., at the age of 56.

The league ultimately decided not to adopt the articles Luther had written.

The work has inspired Tamil culture and people from all walks of life, generating parallels in the literature of various languages within the Indian subcontinent. Its translations into European languages starting from the early 18th century made the work known globally. Authors influenced by the Kural include Ilango Adigal, Seethalai Satthanar, Sekkilar, Kambar, Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, Albert Schweitzer, Ramalinga Swamigal, E. S. Ariel, Constantius Joseph Beschi, Karl Graul, August Friedrich Caemmerer, Nathaniel Edward Kindersley, Francis Whyte Ellis, Charles E. Gover, George Uglow Pope, Vinoba Bhave, Alexander Piatigorsky, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, and Yu Hsi. Many of these authors have translated the work into their languages.\nThe Kural is an oft-quoted Tamil work. Classical Tamil works such as the Purananuru, Manimekalai, Silappathikaram, Periya Puranam, and Kamba Ramayanam all cite the Kural by various names, bestowing numerous titles to the work that was originally untitled by its author. Kural couplets and thoughts are cited in 32 instances in the Purananuru, 35 in Purapporul Venba Maalai, 1 each in Pathittrupatthu and the Ten Idylls, 13 in the Silappathikaram, 91 in the Manimekalai, 20 in Jivaka Chinthamani, 12 in Villi Bharatham, 7 in Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam, and 4 in Kanda Puranam. In Kamba Ramayanam, poet Kambar has used Kural ideas in as many as 600 instances. The work is commonly quoted in vegetarian conferences, both in India and abroad.The Kural text was first included in the school syllabus by the colonial-era British government. However, only select 275 couplets had been taught to the schoolchildren from Standards III through XII. Attempts to include the Kural literature as a compulsory subject in schools were ineffective in the decades following Indian Independence. On 26 April 2016, the Madras High Court directed the Tamil Nadu state government to include all the 108 chapters of the Books of Aram and Porul of the Kural text in school syllabus for classes VI through XII from the academic year 2017\u20132018 \"to build a nation with moral values.\" The court further observed, \"No other philosophical or religious work has such moral and intellectual approach to problems of life.\"The Kural has inspired many, including Mahatma Gandhi, to pursue the path of ahimsa or non-violence. Leo Tolstoy was inspired by the concept of non-violence found in the Kural when he read a German version of the book, who in turn instilled the concept in Mahatma Gandhi through his A Letter to a Hindu when young Gandhi sought his guidance. Gandhi then took to studying the Kural in prison, which eventually culminated in his starting the non-violence movement to fight against the ruling British government. The 19th-century poet-saint 'Vallalar' Ramalinga Swamigal was inspired by the Kural at a young age, who then spent his life promoting compassion and non-violence, emphasizing on non-killing and meatless way of life.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Despite this, the Emperor fulfills his promise and renews the Ninth House by waking several hundred people from cryogenic sleep and delivering them as new citizens to the Ninth. He apologizes that she does not have a real choice in returning to her House, because the Lyctors are perpetually being chased by Resurrection Beasts, the \"ghosts\" of the dead planets of the Nine Houses.\nIn addition, large portions of Harrow\u2019s memory are missing; Ianthe Tridentarius gives her a series of letters written by Harrow herself, giving her detailed instructions for what to do or avoid doing in various scenarios. Ianthe appears to know the reason behind these letters, but has been hexed by this past Harrow to prevent her from any talk of it.\nThe book alternates between two perspectives; second-person chapters documenting Harrow's experiences in the present as a Lyctor, and third-person chapters that take place in the past, documenting Harrow's memories of the events in Canaan House in Gideon the Ninth. However, her memories of Canaan House directly contradict the events of Gideon, including replacing Gideon herself with Ortus Nigenad, who is extremely occupied with his telling of an epic poem called The Noniad, as her cavalier. In this version, Harrow reveals to Ortus that she is insane; she frequently reads text that appears differently to other characters, and hallucinates the beautiful woman she saw in the Locked Tomb as a child whom she refers to as \u201cthe Body.\u201d This hallucination is described to have occurred prior to Canaan House as well as to still be occurring in the Emperor's home space station, the Mithraeum.  \nUpon arriving at Canaan House, Teacher informs the heirs and cavaliers that there is a beast lying in the heart of the facility called \u201cthe Sleeper,\u201d who kills the inverse of the characters that previously died in Gideon; excepting Harrow and Ianthe, all the characters that die in the previous book survive in the flashbacks in Harrow, and vice versa.\nIn the present day, John, the Emperor of the Nine Houses, explains the nature of his secret war: ten thousand years ago, humanity was wiped out by an unknown cataclysm. John resurrected the entire population of humankind with impossibly powerful magic, but the nature of necromancy caused this action to spawn revenant Resurrection Beasts. John and his Lyctors have been fighting the Resurrection Beasts for millennia; most of the Lyctors have been lost to madness or in battle with the Beasts. \nThe surviving Lyctors are Mercymorn, the \"Saint of Joy,\" a vicious and embittered woman; Augustine, the \"Saint of Patience,\" who is flippant and outrageous to hide what seems to be a deadened, ruthless manner; and Ortus, the stoic, relentless \"Saint of Duty.\" \nThese three, along with John, tutor Harrowhark and Ianthe in an extremely dangerous art: the ability to travel to an otherworldly afterlife called The River where they can defeat the Resurrection Beasts by destroying their astral bodies. This travel involves a Lyctor\u2019s soul metaphysically entering the River and letting their consumed cavalier\u2019s soul enter their body in the physical realm in order to defend them while their bodies are vulnerable. However, Harrow\u2019s faulty ascension leaves her unable to do this successfully and so is of limited use in their war. Similarly, Ianthe has difficulty letting her cavalier Naberius take over due to complications with her sword-arm. \nIn the present, the Lyctors prepare to battle with the nearest Resurrection Beast, which is set to arrive at the Mithraeum several years ahead of schedule. Harrow and the others travel to nearby planets and use necromancy to kill them in order to prevent the Beast from feeding on their lifeforces. On one such mission, she encounters Camilla Hect, the cavalier to Palamedes Sextus, believed dead after the events at Canaan House. Camilla is working for the \"Blood of Eden,\" a terrorist organization which seeks to foil the Empire's colonialist ambitions, led by the mysterious Commander Wake. Camilla helps Harrow learn that Palamedes is not truly dead; his spirit is sequestered in a tiny pocket dimension inside the River.\nIn the past, Harrow learns that this Canaan House is not real\u2014instead it is a similar \"pocket\" in the ether sustained by beliefs and memories; everyone in the House other than Harrow is, in truth, dead. It is revealed that Harrow's memory loss and seemingly defective Lyctorhood was caused by Harrow and Ianthe performing brain surgery on Harrow to destroy all memories of Gideon. This ensured that Gideon's soul was never truly absorbed by Harrow and she would continue to exist; Harrow loved her too much to allow her to permanently die.\nThe Canaan House survivors make a last-ditch attempt to fight the Sleeper by casting a spell to summon the spirit of Matthias Nonius, the greatest swordsman in the history of the Ninth House. Matthias's ghost fights the Sleeper to a standstill, energized by Ortus's intense dedication to his legend in The Noniad. They kill the Sleeper\u2014unmasked as a projection of the ghost of Commander Wake\u2014with the help of Matthias Nonius. Marta the Second, Protesilaus the Seventh, and Ortus the Ninth resolve to follow Matthias into the River and face the Resurrection Beast. Abigail and Magnus the Fifth tell Harrow to return to her life.   \nIn the present, Gideon awakens in Harrow's body, revealing that the second person perspective was not stylistic but in fact literal, portraying Gideon's observation of Harrow's actions from her own point of view, while in the \"past,\" Harrow's perspective was her own. Gideon is amazed to find that Harrow's Lyctoral powers, including a healing factor, have finally begun to work. \nAfter leaving Harrow's rooms, Gideon encounters Mercymorn and Augustine, who seem terrified by her sudden appearance, as well as Ianthe, who is also less than pleased to see her; she and Ianthe make their way to the Emperor's chambers, where they find him with the corpse of Cytherea the First, now possessed by the ghost of Commander Wake. He attempts to interrogate her, but makes little progress until the other Lyctors arrive.\nThe Resurrection Beast is repelled by Ortus the First, whose true name is actually Gideon, alongside Matthias and the ghosts, but Harrow's consciousness is either unwilling or unable to return to life. Still in a vision of the Locked Tomb where she first met the Body, she climbs into the Body's empty coffin and falls unconscious again.\nIn the present, it is revealed that Gideon the Ninth was born as a result of Wake artificially inseminating herself with semen stolen from John, making them Gideon's parents. Gideon was created to breach the Locked Tomb on the Ninth House and release the prisoner inside. This prisoner is explained to be Alecto, John's cavalier, whose life was used to give John his limitless necromancy powers while preserving her life. Augustine and Mercymorn have sworn revenge on John for never sharing this technique and letting their cavaliers die needlessly. Mercymorn destroys John's body, but he survives and kills her. He then sheds his affable persona and demands the remaining Lyctors' fealty. Ianthe and Gideon the First accept. Gideon the Ninth and Harrow are exempted from the test due to the former being John's daughter and the latter not being present to make a choice. Augustine declines, vowing to fight and die, and throws John into the River in an attempt to kill him permanently. He nearly succeeds in doing so, but Ianthe intervenes and saves John, dooming Augustine to be eaten by a mouth-like portal at the bottom of the River.\nAt the same time, Gideon the First reveals themself to Gideon the Ninth to actually be Pyrrha Dve, Gideon the First's cavalier, inside his body; similar to Gideon the Ninth, her soul was mostly compartmentalized in the back of his brain for the last ten thousand years, but has occasionally taken over his body. The soul of Gideon the First died fighting the Resurrection Beast, causing Pyrrha to permanently retake control. Gideon and Pyrrha are also pulled into the River; unable to withstand the pressure of the water, Gideon passes out or dies. Six months in the future, an unknown person awakens in an apartment in an unnamed city with Camilla Hect.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Both had been part of the original Ringworld expedition. The Hindmost hopes to acquire Ringworld technology, specifically matter transmutation, to help him regain his position.\nOnce they reach the Ringworld, Louis and Chmeee are sent out to explore, while the Hindmost remains safely behind on their starship. Louis and Chmeee secretly plot to try to overthrow the Hindmost so they can go home. In their travels, they meet a number of the hominid species that have evolved on the Ringworld. They also learn more about the full-scale \"maps\" of various known space worlds, including Earth, Mars and Kzin.\nThey discover that the Ringworld has become unstable and will collide with its star soon. The Ringworld's builders, revealed to be Pak Protectors, have long since died out, and the attitude jets they installed all around the rim to maintain the Ringworld's position were dismounted to use as starship engines. Chmeee goes to the Kzin map for his own goals, while Louis tries to find some way to save the trillions of inhabitants.\nIt is on the Map of Mars that the reunited party (and two natives) finds the Ringworld control room Louis is seeking, located in a vast maze of rooms in the hollow space under the map. To create the rarefied atmosphere on Mars, the Map of Mars was built 20 miles (32 km) above the main surface, creating a 1,120,000,000-cubic-mile (4.7\u00d7109 km3) cavity. The control room contains living space and, among other things, the meteor defense system. The defense system  uses the superconductor grid embedded in the Ringworld's scrith floor to manipulate the magnetic field of the Ringworld's sun to trigger stellar flares that power a titanic gas laser. (The first expedition to the Ringworld crashed after being hit by this laser.)\nThey encounter Teela Brown, a human member of the first expedition who had chosen to remain on Ringworld. She and her lover Seeker had, in the course of their travels, stumbled upon \"Tree-of-Life\" plants. The smell of the plant drove them to eat its roots; Teela was turned into a Pak Protector, with superhuman intelligence and strength, but Seeker died, being too old to undergo the transformation. As a Pak Protector, Teela has little control of her actions; her protective instincts force her to try to save all of the Ringworld inhabitants. This causes a dilemma. She knows of a way to save the Ringworld, but it would entail killing 5% of the people. This she cannot do. She manages to lure Louis and the others to where they can save the other 95%. Her instincts make her fight them, but she does so half-heartedly so that they can kill her.\nAfterward, Louis figures out what to do. Teela had restored starship engines to their original purpose as attitude jets, but only had enough for 5% of the ring. Louis explains that the meteor defense system can generate a massive stellar flare (normally used to power the laser weapon) to provide twenty times more fuel to the attitude jets to move the Ringworld back into position. However, the radiation from the flare will be fatal to everything and everyone living on that section of the Ringworld. The actual task is carried out by the Hindmost, who is far superior at operating the control systems (and can safely pass through a Tree-of-Life plantation en route to the control center, as Louis cannot).\nHaving earlier destroyed the hyperdrive to force the Hindmost to cooperate, Louis is stranded. He and the rest of his party look for some place to settle down, while the Hindmost remains aboard the disabled (but very safe) starship to think things over.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In Greenwood's original conception, the fantastic legends of Earth derive from a fantasy world that can no longer be accessed. Greenwood discovered the Dungeons & Dragons game in 1975, and became a serious role-playing enthusiast with the first Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) game releases in 1978. Greenwood brought his fantasy world into the new medium of role-playing games when a university student named September invited him to play AD&D with her.:\u200a72\u200a The setting became the home of Greenwood's personal campaign. Greenwood began a Realms campaign in the city of Waterdeep before creating a group known as the Knights of Myth Drannor in the Shadowdale region. Greenwood felt that his players' thirst for detail made the Realms what it is: \"They want it to seem real, and work on 'honest jobs' and personal activities, until the whole thing grows into far more than a casual campaign. Roleplaying always governs over rules, and the adventures seem to develop themselves.\" Greenwood has stated that his own version of the Forgotten Realms, as run in his personal campaign, is much darker than published versions.Starting in 1979, Greenwood published a series of articles that detailed the setting in The Dragon (now Dragon) magazine, the first of which was about a monster known as the curst.:\u200a72\u200a Greenwood wrote voluminous entries to Dragon, and used the Realms as a setting for his descriptions of magic items, monsters, and spells. When Gary Gygax \"lost control of TSR in 1985, the company saw an opportunity to move beyond Greyhawk and introduce a new default setting\".:\u200a87\u200a In 1986, TSR began looking for a new campaign setting for AD&D,:\u200a72\u200a and assigned Jeff Grubb to find out more about the setting used by Greenwood as portrayed in his articles in Dragon.Greenwood states that Grubb asked him \"Do you just make this stuff up as you go, or do you really have a huge campaign world?\", and Greenwood answered \"yes\" to both questions. TSR felt that the Forgotten Realms would be a more open-ended setting than its epic fantasy counterpart Dragonlance, and chose the Realms as a ready-made campaign setting upon deciding to publish AD&D 2nd edition. Greenwood agreed to work on the project and began working to get Forgotten Realms officially published. He sent TSR a few dozen cardboard boxes stuffed with pencil notes and maps, and sold all rights to the setting for a token fee. He noted that TSR altered his original conception of the Realms being a place that could be accessed from Earth, as \"[c]oncerns over possible lawsuits (kids getting hurt while trying to 'find a gate') led TSR to de-emphasize this meaning\".Jon Peterson, author of Dungeons and Dragons Art and Arcana: A Visual History, said that Greenwood \"was that rare obsessive DM who just seemed to have more ideas and energy to pour into his world than even the folks at TSR did. Naturally when TSR was shopping for new campaign worlds as part of their cross-media strategy, they had to get the Forgotten Realms. R. A.

Blizzard offered to help develop Brevik's idea as it shared concepts with their recent Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, but strongly urged that they convert the game from turn-based to real-time combat, as well as later urging the including of multiplayer over their new Battle.net service. Over the course of development, Blizzard acquired Condor Games, with Condor, located in San Mateo, California, becoming Blizzard North while Blizzard's main offices in Irvine, California became Blizzard South. Diablo was released in January 1997.Diablo was a top selling game in 1997 with over a million copies sold that year, leading Blizzard to announce its sequel, Diablo II. The sequel, while retaining much of the same gameplay as the original title, used very little of the original code, and had no formal design approach.

In the essay, Buffett presented a chart going back 80 years that showed the value of all \"publicly traded securities\" in the US as a percentage of \"US GNP\".  Buffett said of the metric: \"Still, it is probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment. And as you can see, nearly two years ago the ratio rose to an unprecedented level. That should have been a very strong warning signal\".Buffett explained that for the annual return of US securities to materially exceed the annual growth of US GNP for a protracted period of time: \"you need to have the line go straight off the top of the chart. That won't happen\".  Buffett finished the essay by outlining the levels he believed the metric showed favorable or poor times to invest: \"For me, the message of that chart is this: If the percentage relationship falls to the 70% or 80% area, buying stocks is likely to work very well for you. If the ratio approaches 200%\u2013as it did in 1999 and a part of 2000\u2013you are playing with fire\".Buffett's metric became known as the \"Buffett Indicator\", and has continued to receive widespread attention in the financial media, and in modern finance textbooks.In 2018, finance author Mark Hulbert writing in the Wall Street Journal, listed the Buffett indicator as one of his \"Eight Best Predictors of the Long-Term Market\".A study by two European academics published in May, 2022 found the Buffett Indicator \"explains a large fraction of ten-year return variation for the majority of countries outside the United States\". The study examined 10-year periods in fourteen developed markets, in most cases with data starting in 1973.

Verne returned the dig later when he pointed out that he used gun cotton to send his men to the Moon, an actual substance. \"Can Mr. Wells show me some 'cavourite'?\", he asked archly.The novel (along with Wells' The First Men in the Moon) inspired the first science fiction film, A Trip to the Moon, made in 1902 by Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s; in 1958, another film adaptation of the story was released, titled From the Earth to the Moon and in 1967 became the basis for the very loose adaptation Jules Verne's Rocket to the Moon (1967), a caper-style British comedy starring Burl Ives and Terry-Thomas. The 1961 Czechoslovak film The Fabulous Baron Munchausen combines characters and plot elements from the Verne novel with those of the stories of Baron Munchausen and Cyrano de Bergerac.\nIn March 1953, the Gilberton Company published a comic-book adaptation of From the Earth to the Moon as issue No. 105 in its Classics Illustrated series.  An unidentified scriptwriter combined Verne's From the Earth to the Moon with the sequel, Around the Moon. Gilberton art director Alex A.

The title went through twelve printings between 1953 and 1971.During their return journey from the Moon, the crew of Apollo 11 made reference to Jules Verne's book during a TV broadcast on 23 July. The mission's commander, astronaut Neil Armstrong, said, \"A hundred years ago, Jules Verne wrote a book about a voyage to the Moon. His spaceship, Columbia  [sic], took off from Florida and landed in the Pacific Ocean after completing a trip to the Moon.

The attraction's exterior used a Verne era retro-futuristic influence, with a rivet and boiler plate effect and the \"Columbiad\", which recoils with a bang and produces smoke as the train passes, giving riders the perception of being shot into space.

Falada is often restored to life in film versions, or even spared entirely. While the Queen is implied to have died in the original story, many versions also have her survive to expose the false bride at the wedding. The false bride's motive for suggesting such a cruel punishment varies by retelling; in some, she is simply too ignorant to recognize herself, others have her play along to keep the charade, and others imply she has believed the king is talking about the true bride. Such film versions include:\n\nHarold MacGrath adapted the story into a novel, which was then developed into a 1915 American silent film starring Marguerite Clark. In this version, the princess is stolen at birth and raised as a goose-girl, by a courtier who places his own daughter in her stead. The king she was engaged to at birth falls in love with her without knowing who she is. The courtier's daughter, Hildegarde, is ignorant of the truth and portrayed sympathetically in the original novel, but the film version restores her role as a villainess, where she is raised by her father and is only presented as the princess when she has come of age. The film is believed to be lost.\nThe plot was reworked into 2002's The Princess and the Pea, combining it with another fairy tale.\nThe Goose Girl, a 1957 West German film by Fritz Genschow.\nThe fairy tale was shown in the 1960s television show Jackanory during Season 1, Episode 38 and was read by Dilys Hamlett.\nIn 1985, Tom Davenport adapted the story into a short film as one of his \"From the Brothers Grimm\" series. While visibly set in the American Appalachia, the narration refers to the characters as princesses, princes, and kings, implying that the story retained its European setting. This version is more faithful to Grimm, as Falada is not restored and the false bride is put to death.\nThe story was adapted by East German studio DEFA for their fairytale movie series in the 1989 film The Goose Princess (Die Geschichte von der G\u00e4nseprinzessin und ihrem treuen Pferd Falada), directed by Konrad Petzold.\nTitled \"The Goose Maiden\" in this version, the tale was loosely adapted into a 1999 German short animated episode with slight differences from the source material. This episode was a part of the series SimsalaGrimm. While Falada is still beheaded, this version has him restored to life. There is no prince, but the king himself is the betrothed. Another change is that the princess has been bewitched into forgetting who she is, rather than being forced into posing as the goose-girl.\nThe story was featured in the anime Manga Sekai Mukashi Banashi. In this version, the evil maid is explicitly a witch's daughter. Similar to SimsalaGrimm, the prince and the king are conflated, and he recognizes the princess after overhearing her talk to Falada's head. In the end, the prince makes a charm with his own blood to defeat the witch.Literature:\n\nThe Goose Girl by Shannon Hale is an adaptation of the tale in the form of a novel.\nBloodleaf, the first of a young adult fantasy trilogy by Crystal Smith, is a gothic retelling of \"The Goose Girl.\" It was published by HMHTeen in 2019.\n\"The Goose Girl\" was one of the many folktales used in  Emma Donoghue's novel Kissing The Witch. The tale was titled \"The Tale of The Handkerchief\".\nAuthor Alethea Kontis adapted this tale together with The Wild Swans in the form of a novel titled Dearest.\nAdrienne Rich's 1974 poem \"The Fact of a Doorframe\" references the Goose Girl.\nThe tale was retold into a short children's book by Eric A.

Along with his servant Wilhelm, they travel across the land in search of fair maidens from classic stories in hopes of finding Ludwig a wife. It includes the tale of \"The Goose Girl\" among other tales from the Brothers Grimm.\n\"Falada: the Goose Girl's Horse\" is a short story adaption by author Nancy Farmer. This version tells the classic tale from Falada's point of view.\nThe Canadian poet Jay Macpherson references the story of the Goose Girl in her poems \"Poor Child\" and \"What Falada Said,\" both reprinted in Poems Twice Told: The Boatman and Welcoming Disaster.\nThe Scottish comic book writer Grant Morrison references the story in Doom Patrol issue 31, \"The Word Made Flesh,\" when Baphomet takes the form of Falada's head.\nIntisar Khanani, author of the Sunbolt Chronicles, wrote a fantasy retelling of the Goose Girl, titled \"Thorn\". The novel was independently published in 2012 and re-published by HarperCollins in 2020.\n\"Feathers of Snow: A Goose Girl Retelling\" by Alice Ivinya is a book based on the fairy tale.\nThough Eudora Welty's novella The Robber Bridegroom is named after and largely follows the plot of a different Brothers Grimm fairy tale, much of the action derives from \"The Goose Girl.\"\n\"Little Thieves\" by Margeret Owen is a YA fantasy novel retelling the story of the Goose Girl from the perspective of the princess' maid.

Jonas further praises the development of the character Ender Wiggin: \"Alternately likable and insufferable, he is a convincing little Napoleon in short pants.\"The novel has received criticism for its portrayal of violence and its justification. Elaine Radford's review, \"Ender and Hitler: Sympathy for the Superman\", posits that Ender Wiggin is an intentional reference by Card to Adolf Hitler and criticizes the violence in the novel, particularly at the hands of the protagonist. Card responded to Radford's criticisms in Fantasy Review, the same publication. Radford's criticisms are echoed in John Kessel's essay \"Creating the Innocent Killer: Ender's Game, Intention, and Morality\", wherein Kessel states: \"Ender gets to strike out at his enemies and still remain morally clean. Nothing is his fault.\" Noah Berlatsky makes similar claims in his analysis of the relationship between colonization and science fiction, where he describes Ender's Game as in part a justification of \"Western expansion and genocide\".

Rokoff, it turns out, is also the countess's brother. Tarzan thwarts the villains' scheme, making them his deadly enemies.\nIn France, Rokoff repeatedly tries to eliminate the ape man, finally engineering a duel between him and the count by making it appear that he is the countess's lover. Tarzan deliberately refuses to defend himself in the duel, even offering the count his own weapon after the latter fails to kill him with his own. This gesture convinces the count of Tarzan's innocence. In return, Raoul finds him a job as a special agent in the French ministry of war. Tarzan is assigned to service in Algeria.\nA sequence of adventures among the local Arabs ensues, including another brush with Rokoff. Afterward, Tarzan sails for Cape Town and strikes up a shipboard acquaintance with Hazel Strong, Jane's best friend. Also aboard are Rokoff and Paulovitch, who manage to ambush Tarzan and throw him overboard.\nMiraculously, Tarzan manages to swim to shore and finds himself in the coastal jungle where he grew up. He soon rescues and befriends a native warrior, Busuli of the Waziri tribe, which adopts the ape man. After defeating a raid on their village by ivory raiders, Tarzan becomes their chief.\nThe Waziri know of a lost city deep in the jungle, from which they have obtained their golden ornaments. Tarzan has them take him there, but is captured by its inhabitants, a race of ape-like men, and is condemned to be sacrificed to their sun god. The priestess to perform the sacrifice is a beautiful woman who speaks the ape language Tarzan learned as a child. She tells him she is La, high priestess of the lost city of Opar. When the sacrificial ceremony is interrupted, she hides Tarzan and promises to lead him to freedom. But the ape man escapes on his own, locates a treasure chamber, and manages to rejoin the Waziri.\nMeanwhile, Hazel reaches Cape Town, meeting Jane. With Jane is her father, Professor Porter, and her fianc\u00e9, Tarzan's cousin William Cecil Clayton. They are all invited on a cruise up the west coast of Africa aboard the Lady Alice, the yacht of another friend, Lord Tennington. Rokoff, now using the alias of M. Thuran, ingratiates himself with the party and is also invited along. The Lady Alice breaks down and sinks, forcing the passengers and crew into the lifeboats. The one containing Jane, Clayton and \"Thuran\" is separated from the others and suffers terrible privations. Coincidentally, the boat makes shore in the same general area that Tarzan did.\nThe three construct a rude shelter and eke out an existence of near starvation for weeks until Jane and Clayton are surprised in the forest by a lion. Clayton loses Jane's respect by cowering in fear before the beast instead of defending her, but they are not attacked and discover the lion dead, speared by an unknown hand. Their hidden savior is in fact Tarzan, who does not reveal himself due to anger at seeing Jane with Clayton. Tarzan renounces any dealings with other humans, abandons the Waziri, and rejoins his original ape clan. Jane breaks off her engagement to William.\nLater, Jane is kidnapped and taken to Opar by a party of Oparians who were pursuing their escaped sacrifice, Tarzan. The ape man learns of her capture and tracks them, managing to save her from being sacrificed by La, who is crushed by his spurning of her for Jane. After searching for Jane, Clayton is incapacitated with a fever. Thuran abandons him to die and discovers other survivors from the Lady Alice who came to shore only a few miles away. He tells them he is the sole survivor of his lifeboat.\nTarzan and Jane return to Jane's shelter, along the way encountering Busuli and a group of Waziri who have been searching for their king.

In November 1875 Scribner's published the American edition of these volumes from the English plates of Sampson Low. The purported translator, W. H. G. Kingston, was a famous author of boys' adventure and sailing stories who had fallen on hard times in the 1870s due to business failures, and so he hired out to Sampson Low as the translator for these volumes. However, it is now known that the translator of Mysterious Island and his other Verne novels was actually his wife, Agnes Kinloch Kingston, who had studied on the continent in her youth. The Kingston translation changes the names of the hero from \"Smith\" to \"Harding\"; \"Smith\" is a very common name in the UK and would have been associated, at that time, with the lower classes. In addition many technical passages were abridged or omitted and the anti-imperialist sentiments of the dying Captain Nemo were purged so as not to offend English readers.

The first definite performance in England after Shakespeare's day did not occur until 1906, when F. R. Benson presented the play at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in a production of Shakespeare's two tetralogies, performed over eight nights. As far as can be ascertained, this was not only the first performance of the octology, but was also the first definite performance of both the tetralogy and the trilogy. Benson himself played Henry and his wife, Constance Benson, played Margaret.In 1952, Douglas Seale directed a production of 3 Henry VI at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, following a successful production of 2 Henry VI in 1951. 1 Henry VI would follow in 1953. All three plays starred Paul Daneman as Henry and Rosalind Boxall as Margaret, with 3 Henry VI featuring Alan Bridges as Edward and Edgar Wreford as Richard. Although little was removed from the text, it did end differently from the written play. After Edward has spoken his last lines, everyone leaves the stage except Richard, who walks towards the throne, then turns and looks out to the audience, speaking the first thirty lines of his opening speech from Richard III (from \"Now is the winter of our discontent\" to \"I am determin'd to prove a villain\"), at which point the curtain falls. Additionally, in this production, Boxall as Margaret fully participated in the Battle of Tewkesbury, which was considered a bold move at the time.\n\nA production which made much of its unedited status came in 1977, at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, where Terry Hands presented all three Henry VI plays with Alan Howard as Henry and Helen Mirren as Margaret. Although the production was only moderately successful at the box office, it was critically lauded at the time for Alan Howard's unique portrayal of Henry. Howard adopted historical details concerning the real Henry's madness into his performance, presenting the character as constantly on the brink of a mental and emotional breakdown. Possibly as a reaction to a recent adaptation of the trilogy under the general title Wars of the Roses, which was strongly political, Hands attempted to ensure his own production was entirely apolitical; \"Wars of the Roses was a study in power politics: its central image was the conference table, and Warwick, the scheming king-maker, was the central figure. But that's not Shakespeare. Shakespeare goes far beyond politics. Politics is a very shallow science.\" Aside from Howard and Mirren, the production starred Alfred Lynch as Edward and Anton Lesser as Richard.\nIn 1994, Katie Mitchell directed the play as a stand-alone piece for the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) at The Other Place theatre in Stratford, under the title Henry VI: The Battle for the Throne. Starring Jonathan Firth as Henry, Ruth Mitchell as Margaret, Tom Smith as Richard and Lloyd Owen as Edward, the play added dialogue (primarily anti-war material) from Gorboduc, Richard II, 2 Henry VI and Richard III. Mitchell cut all on-stage violence, resulting in York, Rutland, Prince Edward and Henry all being killed off-stage. The introduction of the head of Somerset was also removed, with the play beginning instead at line 25, \"This is the palace of the fearful king.\" Also removed was much of Margaret's speech to rouse her army prior to Tewkesbury.\nUnder the direction of Michael Boyd, the play was presented at the Swan Theatre in Stratford in 2000, with David Oyelowo as Henry, Fiona Bell as Margaret, Tom Beard as Edward and Aidan McArdle as Richard. The play was presented with the other five history plays (Richard II, 1 Henry IV, 2 Henry IV, Henry V and Richard III) to form a complete eight-part history cycle under the general title This England: The Histories (the first time the RSC had ever attempted to stage the eight plays as one sequence). This England: The Histories was revived in 2006, as part of the Complete Works festival at the Courtyard Theatre, with the Henry VI plays again directed by Boyd, and starring Chuk Iwuji as Henry, Katy Stephens as Margaret, Forbes Masson as Edward and Jonathan Slinger as Richard. When the Complete Works wrapped in March 2007, the history plays remained on stage, under the shorter title The Histories, as part of a two-year thirty-four actor ensemble production. 3 Henry VI was performed under the title Henry VI, Part 3: The Chaos. At the end of the two-year programme, the entire octology was performed over a four-day period under the title The Glorious Moment; Richard II was staged on a Thursday evening, followed by the two Henry IV plays on Friday afternoon and evening, the three Henry VI plays on Saturday (two afternoon performances and one evening performance), and Richard III on Sunday evening.Boyd's production garnered much attention at the time because of his interpolations and additions to the text. Boyd introduced a new character into the trilogy. Called The Keeper, the character never speaks, but upon the death of each major character, the Keeper (played by Edward Clayton in 2000, and by Anthony Bunsee in 2006/2007), wearing all red, would walk onto stage and approach the body. The actor playing the body would then stand up and allow himself to be led off-stage by the figure. The production was also particularly noted for its realistic violence. According to Robert Gore-Langton of the Daily Express, in his review of the original 2000 production, \"blood from a severed arm sprayed over my lap. A human liver slopped to the floor by my feet. An eyeball scudded past, then a tongue.\"In 2012, the trilogy was staged at Shakespeare's Globe as part of the Globe to Globe Festival, with each play performed by a different Balkans based company and offered as a commentary on the recent history of violence in that region. 3 Henry VI was staged by the Macedonian company National Theatre Bitola, directed by John Blondell, and starring Petar Gorko as Henry, Gabriela Petrusevska as Margaret, Nikolche Projchevski as Edward and Martin Mirchevski as Richard. In 2013, Nick Bagnall directed another production of the trilogy at the Globe. All three plays were performed each day, beginning at midday, under the overall title Henry VI: Three Plays. 3 Henry VI was performed under the title Henry VI: The True Tragedy of the Duke of York. Each of the plays was edited down to two hours, and the entire trilogy was performed with a cast of fourteen actors. On several specific dates, the plays were performed at the actual locations where some of the original events took place and streamed live to the theatre; \"battlefield productions\" were staged at Towton (Battle of Towton from 3 Henry VI), Tewkesbury (Battle of Tewkesbury from 3 Henry VI), St Albans Cathedral (First Battle of St Albans from 2 Henry VI and Second Battle of St Albans from 3 Henry VI), and Monken Hadley Common (Battle of Barnet from 3 Henry VI). The production starred Graham Butler as Henry, Mary Doherty as Margaret, Patrick Myles as Edward and Simon Harrison as Richard.Outside the UK, the first major American performance was in 1935 at the Pasadena Playhouse in California, directed by Gilmore Brown, as part of a production of all ten Shakespearean histories (the two tetralogies, preceded by King John and proceeded by Henry VIII). In 2010 in New York City, the independent theatre company Wide Eyed Productions, in association with Columbia University, mounted a stand-alone production of the play at the East 13th Street Theatre (home of Classic Stage Company). The production was directed by Adam Marple and featured Nat Cassidy as Henry, Candace Thompson as Margaret, Sky Seals as Edward and Ben Newman as Richard. It was noted as being a rare opportunity to see the play on its own and was well received \u2013 particularly for its staging of the conclusion, in which Henry's corpse remained onstage, doused in a steady rain of blood, throughout Edward IV's final scene, after which a naked and feral Richard bolts onstage and delivers the opening lines of Richard III, before literally eating the throne. The play also featured a huge portrait of Henry V wallpapered to the upstage wall that was steadily torn apart over the course of the play.In Europe, unedited stagings of the play took place at the Weimar Court Theatre in 1857. Directed by Franz von Dingelstedt, it was performed as the seventh part of the octology, with all eight plays staged over a ten-day period. A major production was staged at the Burgtheater in Vienna in 1873. Jocza Savits directed a production of the tetralogy at the Munich Court Theatre in 1889 and again in 1906. In 1927, Saladin Schmitt presented the unedited octology at the Municipal Theatre in Bochum. Denis Llorca staged the tetralogy as one twelve-hour piece in Carcassonne in 1978 and in Cr\u00e9teil in 1979. In 1999, director Ruediger Burbach presented 2 Henry VI and 3 Henry VI at the Zurich Playhouse. This production was unique insofar as a woman (Katharina Schmoelzer) played Henry. Margaret was played by Katharina von Bock.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is often so misguided that the authors appear not to notice their own egregious flouting of its own rules ... It's sad. Several generations of college students learned their grammar from the uninformed bossiness of Strunk and White, and the result is a nation of educated people who know they feel vaguely anxious and insecure whenever they write however or than me or was or which, but can't tell you why.\nPullum has argued, for example, that the authors misunderstood what constitutes the passive voice, and he criticized their proscription of established and unproblematic English usages, such as the split infinitive and the use of which in a restrictive relative clause.

{"id": "50_209", "question": "Who is the author of \"Richard II\"?", "ctxs": [{"id": "22_49252", "text": "When Richard became king in September 1189, he had already declared his intention of joining the Third Crusade. He set about raising the huge sums of money required for this expedition through the sale of lands, titles and appointments, and attempted to ensure that he would not face a revolt while away from his empire. John was made Count of Mortain, was married to the wealthy Isabella of Gloucester, and was given valuable lands in Lancaster and the counties of Cornwall, Derby, Devon, Dorset, Nottingham and Somerset, all with the aim of buying his loyalty to Richard whilst the King was on crusade. Richard retained royal control of key castles in these counties, thereby preventing John from accumulating too much military and political power. The King named his four-year-old nephew Arthur as his heir. In return, John promised not to visit England for the next three years, thereby in theory giving Richard adequate time to conduct a successful crusade and return from the Levant without fear of John seizing power. Richard left political authority in England\u2014the post of justiciar\u2014jointly in the hands of Bishop Hugh de Puiset and William de Mandeville, 3rd Earl of Essex, and made William Longchamp, the Bishop of Ely, his chancellor. Mandeville immediately died, and Longchamp took over as joint justiciar with Puiset, which would prove a less than satisfactory partnership. Eleanor, the queen mother, convinced Richard to allow John into England in his absence.The political situation in England rapidly began to deteriorate. Longchamp refused to work with Puiset and became unpopular with the English nobility and clergy. John exploited this unpopularity to set himself up as an alternative ruler with his own royal court, complete with his own justiciar, chancellor and other royal posts, and was happy to be portrayed as an alternative regent, and possibly the next king. Armed conflict broke out between John and Longchamp, and by October 1191 Longchamp was isolated in the Tower of London with John in control of the city of London, thanks to promises John had made to the citizens in return for recognition as Richard's heir presumptive. At this point Walter of Coutances, the Archbishop of Rouen, returned to England, having been sent by Richard to restore order. John's position was undermined by Walter's relative popularity and by the news that Richard had married whilst in Cyprus, which presented the possibility that Richard would have legitimate children and heirs.\nThe political turmoil continued. John began to explore an alliance with King Philip II of France, who had returned from the crusade in late 1191. John hoped to acquire Normandy, Anjou and the other lands in France held by Richard in exchange for allying himself with Philip. John was persuaded not to pursue an alliance by his mother. Longchamp, who had left England after Walter's intervention, now returned, and argued that he had been wrongly removed as justiciar. John intervened, suppressing Longchamp's claims in return for promises of support from the royal administration, including a reaffirmation of his position as heir to the throne. When Richard still did not return from the crusade, John began to assert that his brother was dead or otherwise permanently lost. Richard had in fact been captured shortly before Christmas 1192, while en route to England, by Duke Leopold V of Austria and was handed over to Emperor Henry VI, who held him for ransom. John seized the opportunity and went to Paris, where he formed an alliance with Philip. He agreed to set aside his wife, Isabella of Gloucester, and marry Philip's sister, Alys, in exchange for Philip's support. Fighting broke out in England between forces loyal to Richard and those being gathered by John. John's military position was weak and he agreed to a truce; in early 1194 the King finally returned to England, and John's remaining forces surrendered. John retreated to Normandy, where Richard finally found him later that year. Richard declared that John\u2014despite being 27 years old\u2014was merely \"a child who has had evil counsellors\" and forgave him, but removed his lands with the exception of Ireland.For the remaining years of Richard's reign, John supported his brother on the continent, apparently loyally. Richard's policy on the continent was to attempt to regain through steady, limited campaigns the castles he had lost to Philip II whilst on crusade. He allied himself with the leaders of Flanders, Boulogne and the Holy Roman Empire to apply pressure on Philip from Germany. In 1195 John successfully conducted a sudden attack and siege of \u00c9vreux castle, and subsequently managed the defences of Normandy against Philip. The following year, John seized the town of Gamaches and led a raiding party within 50 miles (80 km) of Paris, capturing the Bishop of Beauvais. In return for this service, Richard withdrew his malevolentia (ill-will) towards John, restored him to the county of Gloucestershire and made him again the Count of Mortain.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In his later years, however, notable Sunni traditionists were said to have visited him, including Ibn Rahwayh and Yahya ibn Yahya. In particular, his appointment as the heir apparent seemed to have added to the credibility to al-Rida in Sunni circles, who at the time apparently came to regard him as a distinguished transmitter by virtue of his learning and descent from the prophet. In view of his continued veneration as a Shia Imam, later Sunni authors were divided about the authority of al-Rida, some saying that he was not always a reliable transmitter and others instead questioning the authority of those who transmitted from al-Rida. They all seem to refer to him as a man of piety and learning.It has been commonly held that Ma'ruf al-Karkhi, who converted to Islam at the hands of al-Rida, is a prominent figure in the golden chain of most Sufi orders. He is said to have been a devoted student of al-Rida, though Bayhom-Daou regards the accounts of their encounters as apocryphal.

Jan \u010capek argued that:\n\"Whether Polidori wrote 'The Vampyre' out of spite toward Byron or not, whether he is guilty of a measure of plagiarism, or whether he even intended to have the story published or not, the tale energizes a series of figurations of the vampire in what is now over two centuries long tradition of vampire prose fiction. No matter the mysterious occasions or the undisclosed motivations or intentions, Polidori\u2019s 'The Vampyre' must be judged by its shaping of vampire fiction, giving it a true start which would capture the Victorian period as much as the vampire panic captured the Enlightened period and as much as it would later capture much of the twentieth century without the interest waning in the early decades of the twenty-first century. [...] John William Polidori unleashes the figure of the vampire, in all its aristocratic and privileged, rhetorically powerful and seductive, sexually potent and corruptive and, in any case, cunning and elusive power.\"That influence has extended into the current era as the text is seen as \"canonical\" and \u2013 together with Bram Stoker's Dracula and others \u2013 is \"often even cited as almost folkloric sources on vampirism\". An adaptation appeared in 1820 with Cyprien B\u00e9rard's novel Lord Ruthwen ou les Vampires, falsely attributed to Charles Nodier, who himself then wrote his own dramatic version, Le Vampire, a play which had enormous success and sparked a \"vampire craze\" across Europe. This includes operatic adaptations by Heinrich Marschner (see Der Vampyr) and Peter Josef von Lindpaintner (see Der Vampyr), both published in the same year. Nikolai Gogol, Alexandre Dumas and Aleksey Tolstoy all produced vampire tales, and themes in Polidori's tale would continue to influence Bram Stoker's Dracula and eventually the whole vampire genre. Dumas makes explicit reference to Lord Ruthven in The Count of Monte Cristo, going so far as to state that his character \"The Comtesse G...\" had been personally acquainted with Lord Ruthven.In 1819, The Black Vampyre, an American novella by Uriah D'Arcy, was published, taking advantage of The Vampyre's popularity.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It has come to be seen as the archetypal modern African novel in English, and is read in Nigeria and throughout Africa. It is studied widely in Europe, India, and North America, where it has spawned numerous secondary and tertiary analytical works. It has achieved similar status and repute in Australia and Oceania. Considered Achebe's magnum opus, it has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide. Time magazine included the novel in its TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005. The novel has been translated into more than 50 languages, and is often used in literature, world history, and African studies courses across the world.\nAchebe is now considered to be the essential novelist on African identity, nationalism, and decolonization. Achebe's main focus has been cultural ambiguity and contestation. The complexity of novels such as Things Fall Apart depends on Achebe's ability to bring competing cultural systems and their languages to the same level of representation, dialogue, and contestation.Reviewers have praised Achebe's neutral narration and have described Things Fall Apart as a realistic novel. Much of the critical discussion about Things Fall Apart concentrates on the socio-political aspects of the novel, including the friction between the members of Igbo society as they confront the intrusive and overpowering presence of Western government and beliefs. Ernest N. Emenyonu commented that \"Things Fall Apart is indeed a classic study of cross-cultural misunderstanding and the consequences to the rest of humanity, when a belligerent culture or civilization, out of sheer arrogance and ethnocentrism, takes it upon itself to invade another culture, another civilization.\"Achebe's writing about African society, in telling from an African point of view the story of the colonization of the Igbo, was noted at its publication in Europe and America to help combat the systemic Western misconception that African culture was savage and primitive. In Things Fall Apart, western culture is portrayed as being \"arrogant and ethnocentric,\" insisting that the African culture needed a leader. As it had no kings or chiefs, Umuofian culture was vulnerable to invasion by western civilization. It is felt that the repression of the Igbo language at the end of the novel contributes greatly to the destruction of the culture. Although Achebe favours the African culture of the pre-western society, the author attributes its destruction to the \"weaknesses within the native structure.\" Achebe portrays the culture as having a religion, a government, a system of money, and an artistic tradition, as well as a judicial system.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The Latin Empire was intended to replace the Byzantine Empire as the Western-recognized Roman Empire in the east, with a Catholic emperor enthroned in place of the Eastern Orthodox Roman emperors. The main objective of the Latin Empire was planned by Venice, which promoted the creation of this state for their self-benefit.The Fourth Crusade had originally been called to retake the Muslim-controlled city of Jerusalem, but a sequence of economic and political events culminated in the Crusader army sacking the city of Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire. Originally, the plan had been to restore the deposed Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelos, who had been usurped by Alexios III Angelos, to the throne. The crusaders had been promised financial and military aid by Isaac's son Alexios IV, with which they had planned to continue to Jerusalem. When the crusaders reached Constantinople the situation quickly turned volatile and while Isaac and Alexios briefly ruled, the crusaders did not receive the payment they had hoped for. In April 1204, they captured and plundered the city's enormous wealth.\nThe crusaders selected their own emperor from among their own ranks, Baldwin of Flanders, and divided the territory of the Byzantine Empire into various new vassal crusader states. The Latin Empire's authority was immediately challenged by Byzantine rump states led by the Laskaris family (connected to the Angelos dynasty of 1185\u20131204) in Nicaea and the Komnenos family (which had ruled as Byzantine Emperors 1081\u20131185) in Trebizond. From 1224 to 1242 the Komnenos Doukas family, also connected to the Angeloi, challenged Latin authority from Thessalonica. The Latin Empire failed to attain political or economic dominance over the other Latin powers that had been established in former Byzantine territories in the wake of the Fourth Crusade, especially Venice, and after a short initial period of military successes it went into a steady decline due to constant war with Bulgaria to the north and the various Byzantine claimants. Eventually, the Nicene Empire recovered Constantinople and restored the Byzantine Empire under Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1261. The last Latin emperor, Baldwin II, went into exile, but the imperial title survived, with several pretenders to it, until the 14th century.\nThe incontestable Venetian domination in the region was not limited to the practical respect, but was also demonstrated by the new title adopted by the doges, that is of 'Dominus quartae partis et dimidie totius Imperii Romaniae', attached to the one of 'Dux Venetiarum, Dalmatiae Croatiaeque'. Beginning with the letters of Innocent III, dated 20 June 1203 and 29 January 1205, the Papacy often used this term too. The term Romania (\"Land of the Romans\") had been used as a vernacular name for centuries, first by the inhabitants of the entire Late Roman Empire, then by the population of the Byzantine Empire.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The themes and ideas in Tirukku\u1e5fa\u1e37 \u2013 sometimes with close similarities and sometimes with significant differences \u2013 are also found in Manu's Manusmriti (also called the Manavadharmasastra), Kautilya's Arthashastra, Kamandaka's Nitisara, and Vatsyayana's Kamasutra. Some of the teachings in the Tirukku\u1e5fa\u1e37, states Zvelebil, are \"undoubtedly\" based on the then extant Sanskrit works such as the more ancient Arthashastra and Manusmriti.According to Zvelebil, the Tirukku\u1e5fa\u1e37 borrows \"a great number of lines\" and phrases from earlier Tamil texts. For example, phrases found in Kuruntokai (lit. \"The Collection of Short [Poems]\") and many lines in Narrinai (lit. \"The Excellent Love Settings\") which starts with an invocation to Vishnu, appear in the later Tirukku\u1e5fa\u1e37. Authors who came after the composition of the Tirukku\u1e5fa\u1e37 similarly extensively quoted and borrowed from the Tirukku\u1e5fa\u1e37. For example, the Prabandhas such as the Tiruvalluvamalai probably from the 10th century CE are anthologies on Tirukku\u1e5fa\u1e37, and these extensively quote and embed it verses written in meters ascribed to gods, goddesses, and revered Tamil scholars. Similarly, the love story Perunkatai (lit. \"The Great Story\") probably composed in the 9th century quotes from the Tirukku\u1e5fa\u1e37 and embeds similar teachings and morals. Verse 22.59\u201361 of the Manimekalai \u2013 a Buddhist-princess and later nun based love story epic, likely written about the 6th century CE, also quotes the Tirukku\u1e5fa\u1e37. This Buddhist epic ridicules Jainism while embedding morals and ideals similar to those in the Kural.The Tirukku\u1e5fa\u1e37 teachings are similar to those found in Arthasastra but differ in some important aspects. In Valluvar's theory of state, unlike Kautilya, the army (patai) is the most important element. Valluvar recommends that a well kept and well-trained army (patai) led by an able commander and ready to go to war is necessary for a state.According to Hajela, the Porul of the Kural text is based on morality and benevolence as its cornerstones. The Tirukku\u1e5fa\u1e37 teaches that the ministers and people who work in public office should lead an ethical and moral life. Unlike the Manusmriti, the Kural does not give women a lowly and dependent position but are rather idealised. The Tirukku\u1e5fa\u1e37 also does not give importance to castes or any dynasty of rulers and ministers. The text states that one should call anyone with virtue and kindness a Brahmin.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In 1765, Sterne travelled through France and Italy as far south as Naples, and after returning determined to describe his travels from a sentimental point of view. The novel can be seen as an epilogue to the possibly unfinished work The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, and also as an answer to Tobias Smollett's decidedly unsentimental Travels Through France and Italy. Sterne had met Smollett during his travels in Europe, and strongly objected to his spleen, acerbity and quarrelsomeness. He modelled the character of Smelfungus on him.The novel was extremely popular and influential and helped establish travel writing as the dominant genre of the second half of the 18th century. Unlike prior travel accounts which stressed classical learning and objective non-personal points of view, A Sentimental Journey emphasized the subjective discussions of personal taste and sentiments, of manners and morals over classical learning. Throughout the 1770s female travel writers began publishing significant numbers of sentimental travel accounts. Sentiment also became a favourite style among those expressing non-mainstream views, including political radicalism.\nThe narrator is the Reverend Mr. Yorick, who is slyly represented to guileless readers as Sterne's barely disguised alter ego. The book recounts his various adventures, usually of the amorous type, in a series of self-contained episodes.

Benson attributes the neglect to various factors. The Sun Also Rises, published the next year, is considered the more important book followed fairly rapidly by the popular A Farewell to Arms two years after in 1928; critics' general assumption seemed to be that Hemingway's talent lay in writing prose rather than \"sophisticated, complex design\"; and In Our Time stories were combined with subsequent collections in the publication of The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories in 1938, drawing the critics' attention away from the book as an entity, toward the individual stories.

Notably, the author makes no reference to the idea of a bodily resurrection, which the Sadducees opposed. That said, our knowledge of the Sadducees is scant, so it is difficult to know for sure. The book also comes across as dismissive of martyrdom and passive approaches to resistance, seeing such gestures as futile and pointless.  Some scholars go even farther than dismissive; Jonathan Goldstein writes that the author has \"considerable contempt for martyrs\".  For the author, bold military action while living is the proper response to oppression.The author sees the revolt as divinely ordained, but downplays direct divine intervention such as miracles. Rather, the author interprets events as God using the military genius of Judas Maccabeus and his brothers as the instrument to achieve the liberation of Judea.  One of the most notable and unusual aspects of the book of 1 Maccabees by absence is the lack of any direct mention of God.  Rather, the book refers to \"heaven\" (ouran\u00f3s) instead, such as Judas saying in a speech that \"It is not on the size of the army that victory in battle depends, but strength comes from Heaven.\"  Even if \"heaven\" is merely shorthand for \"God in heaven\", 1 Maccabees is remarkably secular in its depiction of the conflict.  No angels or miracles come to save the Jews; rather, it is the divinely-approved firm leadership of the Hasmoneans that leads to victory.The book 2 Maccabees, preserved right next to 1 Maccabees in the Septuagint, provides a striking contrast in theology, and the works are often compared.  2 Maccabees interprets the misfortunes of the Jews as God's punishment for their own sins; the author of 1 Maccabees depicts the problems as due to the external evil of Antiochus IV and his generals, not as a cleansing ordeal that was in some sense divine will.\nThe book draws a sharp contrast between Jews and Gentiles, similar to the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.  The persecution of Antiochus IV presumably radicalized the Jews. That said, the author is still proud of forging alliances with others, citing negotiations with the Roman Republic and Sparta.

The poverty and misery arising from a too rapid increase of population had been distinctly seen, and the most violent remedies proposed, so long ago as the times of Plato and Aristotle. And of late years the subject has been treated in such a manner by some of the French Economists; occasionally by Montesquieu, and, among our own writers, by Dr. Franklin, Sir James Stewart, Mr. Arthur Young, and Mr. Townsend, as to create a natural surprise that it had not excited more of the public attention.\nThe 2nd edition, published in 1803 (with Malthus now clearly identified as the author), was entitled \"An Essay on the Principle of Population; or, a View of its Past and Present Effects on Human Happiness; with an enquiry into our Prospects respecting the Future Removal or Mitigation of the Evils which it occasions.\"\nMalthus advised that the 2nd edition \"may be considered as a new work\", and the subsequent editions were all minor revisions of the 2nd edition. These were published in 1806, 1807, 1817, and 1826.\nBy far the biggest change was in how the 2nd to 6th editions of the essay were structured, and the most copious and detailed evidence that Malthus presented, more than any previous such book on population. Essentially, for the first time, Malthus examined his own Principle of Population on a region-by-region basis of world population. The essay was organized in four books:\n\nBook I \u2013 Of the Checks to Population in the Less Civilized Parts of the World and in Past Times.\nBook II \u2013 Of the Checks To Population in the Different States of Modern Europe.\nBook III \u2013 Of the different Systems or Expedients which have been proposed or have prevailed in Society, as They affect the Evils arising from the Principle of Population.\nBook IV \u2013 Of our future Prospects respecting the Removal or Mitigation of the Evils arising from the Principle of Population.Due in part to the highly influential nature of Malthus' work (see main article Thomas Malthus), this approach is regarded as pivotal in establishing the field of demography and even to him being regarded as its founding father.The following controversial quote appears in the second edition:\nA man who is born into a world already possessed, if he cannot get subsistence from his parents on whom he has a just demand, and if the society do not want his labour, has no claim of right to the smallest portion of food, and, in fact, has no business to be where he is. At nature's mighty feast there is no vacant cover for him. She tells him to be gone, and will quickly execute her own orders, if he does not work upon the compassion of some of her guests. If these guests get up and make room for him, other intruders immediately appear demanding the same favour. The report of a provision for all that come, fills the hall with numerous claimants. The order and harmony of the feast is disturbed, the plenty that before reigned is changed into scarcity; and the happiness of the guests is destroyed by the spectacle of misery and dependence in every part of the hall, and by the clamorous importunity of those, who are justly enraged at not finding the provision which they had been taught to expect. The guests learn too late their error, in counter-acting those strict orders to all intruders, issued by the great mistress of the feast, who, wishing that all guests should have plenty, and knowing she could not provide for unlimited numbers, humanely refused to admit fresh comers when her table was already full.\nEcologist Professor Garrett Hardin claims that the preceding passage inspired hostile reactions from many critics. The offending passage of Malthus' essay appeared in the 2nd edition only, as Malthus felt obliged to remove it.From the 2nd edition onwards \u2013 in Book IV \u2013 Malthus advocated moral restraint as an additional, and voluntary, check on population.

Tolkien was fond of the novel, and it is believed to have influenced his novella Roverandom.The watch used by Sylvie and Bruno has been described as an early type of time machine, making Sylvie and Bruno an early example of time travel fiction; Lisa Yaszek noted that \"The explosion of such stories during this era [1889 onward] might come from the fact that people were beginning to standardize time, and orient themselves to clocks more frequently.\"In 2011, Richard Jenkyns of Prospect described Carroll's use of baby talk in the book as \"embarrassing.\"In 2014, Mari Ness wrote \"Carroll abruptly shifts from one world to the other often without sense or reason or letting the reader know what\u2019s going on. This is meant, I think, to convey the thin line between reality and dream, and to accent the narrator\u2019s confusion\u2014since he himself is often not at all sure what is going on.

Friedenberg wrote that the book's weaknesses were its \"pedantic style, the consistent underestimate of the opposition and the very peculiar avoidance of Freire's own extensive experience as a source of illustrative material\". Friedenberg said that a positive aspect of the book was Freire's recognition that formal education in the Brazilian setting is \"counter-revolutionary and oppressive\".:\u200a379\u200aIn his 1989 book Life in Schools, Peter McLaren emphasized that the teacher's politics are foundational to the pedagogy articulated in Freire's book. Building on McLaren, others said that the fourth chapter is the lynchpin holding the project together, and that the emphasis on the first two chapters severs Freire's method from his ideology and his politics from his pedagogy. The reasons for its neglect stem from the chapter's explicit concern with the revolutionary party and leadership, which Derek R. Ford argued flows from the Leninist conception of the party. Tyson Lewis similarly said that \"Freire himself clearly saw his pedagogy as a tool to be used within revolutionary organization to mediate the various relationships between the oppressed and the leaders of resistance.\"Freire was criticized by feminists for his use of sexist language in Pedagogy of the Oppressed,:\u200a127\u2013128\u200a and it was revised for the 1995 edition to avoid sexism. Freire's later writings reflect the impact of this criticism, and use more inclusive language.:\u200a128\u200aFreire's work was one inspiration for Augusto Boal's Theatre of the Oppressed.In his introduction to the 30th anniversary edition of Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Donaldo Macedo, a former colleague of Freire and University of Massachusetts Boston professor, called the book a revolutionary text, and said that people in totalitarian states risk punishment for reading it.:\u200a16\u200a During the apartheid period in South Africa, the book was banned. Clandestine copies of the book were distributed underground as part of the \"ideological weaponry\" of various revolutionary groups like the Black Consciousness Movement.In 2006, Pedagogy of the Oppressed came under criticism over its use by the Mexican American Studies Department Program at Tucson High School. In 2010, the Arizona State Legislature passed House Bill 2281, enabling the Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction to restrict state funding to public schools with ethnic studies programs, effectively banning the programs. Tom Horne, who was Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction at the time, criticized the programs for \"teaching students that they are oppressed\". The book was among seven titles officially confiscated from Mexican American studies classrooms, sometimes in front of students, by the Tucson Unified School District after the passing of HB 2281.In a 2009 article for the conservative City Journal, Sol Stern wrote that Pedagogy of the Oppressed ignores the traditional touchstones of Western education (e.g. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, John Dewey, or Maria Montessori) and contains virtually none of the information typically found in traditional teacher education (e.g., no discussion of curriculum, testing, or age-appropriate learning). On the contrary, Freire rejects traditional education as \"official knowledge\" that intends to oppress. Stern also wrote in 2006 that heirs to Freire's ideas have taken them to mean that since all education is political: \"leftist math teachers who care about the oppressed have a right, indeed a duty, to use a pedagogy that, in Freire's words, 'does not conceal\u2014in fact, which proclaims\u2014its own political character'\".A 2019 article in British internet magazine Spiked said that \"In 2016, the Open Syllabus Project catalogued the 100 most requested titles on its service by English-speaking universities: the only Brazilian on its list was Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "50_241", "question": "Who is the author of Institutio Oratoria?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_19280", "text": "In Quintilian's time, rhetoric was primarily composed of three aspects: the theoretical, the educational, and the practical. Institutio Oratoria does not claim originality; Quintilian drew from a number of sources in compiling his work. This eclecticism also prevented him from adhering too rigidly to any particular school of thought on the matter, although Cicero stands out among the other sources. Quintilian also refused any short, simple lists of rules; he evidently felt that the study and art of rhetoric could not be so reduced. This might explain the length of Institutio Oratoria, which consists of twelve books.\nFrom the middle of the first century BC to Quintilian's time, there had been a flowering of Roman rhetoric. But by Quintilian's time, the current of popular taste in oratory was rife with what has been called \"silver Latin,\" a style that favored ornate embellishment over clarity and precision. Quintilian's Institutio Oratoria can in many ways be read as a reaction against this trend; it advocates a return to simpler and clearer language. It may also reflect the influence of the late Emperor Vespasian, who was \u201c[a] man of plebeian stock, ... a down-to-earth realist with the common touch\u201d (Murray, 431); Vespasian disliked excess and extravagance, and his patronage of Quintilian may have influenced the latter's views of language. Cicero is the model Quintilian adopts as the standard-bearer for this form; during the previous century, Cicero's far more concise style was the standard. This relates to his discussion of nature and art. Quintilian evidently preferred the natural, especially in language, and disliked the excessive ornamentation popular in the style of his contemporaries. Deviating from natural language and the natural order of thought in pursuit of an over-elaborate style created confusion in both the orator and his audience. \u201cEven difficult questions can be dealt with by an orator of moderate ability if he is content to follow nature as his leader and does not give all his attention to a showy style\u201d (Gwynn, 78).\nInstitutio Oratoria is effectively a comprehensive textbook of the technical aspects of rhetoric. From the eleventh chapter of Book II to the end of Book XI, Quintilian covers such topics as natural order, the relation of nature and art, invention, proof, emotion, and language. Perhaps most influential among the ideas discussed is his examination of tropes and figures, found in Books 8 and 9. \u201c[A] trope involves the substitution of one word for another, a figure does not necessarily entail any change either to the order or the meaning of words\u201d (Leitch, 156). An example of a trope would be metaphor, the altering of a word's meaning. A figure, on the other hand, gives the words a new aspect or greater emotional value. Figures are divided into figures of thought, which may make proof seem more forceful, intensify emotions, or add elegance or ornamentation; and figures of diction, which is further subdivided into \u201cthe grammatical, in which the form of the word creates the figure, and the rhetorical, in which the position of the word is the primary factor\u201d (Gwynn, 88).\nA good part of this work, of course, deals with the technical aspects of rhetoric and the Institutio Oratoria stands \u2014 along with Aristotle's 'Rhetoric' and Cicero's works \u2014 as one of the ancient world's greatest works on rhetoric. He organizes the practice of oratory into five canons: inventio (discovery of arguments), dispositio (arrangement of arguments), elocutio (expression or style), memoria (memorization), and pronuntiatio (delivery). For each canon, particularly the first three, he provides a thorough exposition of all the elements that must be mastered and considered in developing and presenting arguments. The thorough and sensible presentation reflect his long experience as orator and teacher, and in many ways the work can be seen as the culmination of Greek and Roman rhetorical theory.\nThroughout these and other discussions, Quintilian remains concerned with the practical, applicable aspect, rather than the theoretical. Unlike many modern theorists, he \u201cdoes not see figurative language as a threat to the stability of linguistic reference\u201d (Leitch, 156). The referential use of a word was always the primary meaning, and the use of figurative language was merely an addition to it, not a replacement for it.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The poem's origins are unknown, but it was partly inspired by Gray's thoughts following the death of the poet Richard West in 1742. Originally titled Stanzas Wrote in a Country Church-Yard, the poem was completed when Gray was living near the Church of St Giles, Stoke Poges. It was sent to his friend Horace Walpole, who popularised the poem among London literary circles. Gray was eventually forced to publish the work on 15 February 1751 in order to preempt a magazine publisher from printing an unlicensed copy of the poem.\nThe poem is an elegy in name but not in form; it employs a style similar to that of contemporary odes, but it embodies a meditation on death, and remembrance after death. The poem argues that the remembrance can be good and bad, and the narrator finds comfort in pondering the lives of the obscure rustics buried in the churchyard. The two versions of the poem, Stanzas and Elegy, approach death differently; the first contains a stoic response to death, but the final version contains an epitaph which serves to repress the narrator's fear of dying.\nThe Elegy quickly became popular. It was printed many times and in a variety of formats, translated into many languages, and praised by critics even after Gray's other poetry had fallen out of favour.

Fifteen months after its publication, it was reviewed by Lewis Gaylord Clark, a fellow author who carried on a substantial feud with Poe. His review printed in The Knickerbocker said the book was \"told in a loose and slip-shod style, seldom chequered by any of the more common graces of composition.\" Clark went on, \"This work is one of much interest, with all its defects, not the least of which is that it is too liberally stuffed with 'horrid circumstances of blood and battle.'\"Many reviewers commented on the excess of violent scenes. In addition to noting the novel's gruesome details, a review in Burton's Gentleman's Magazine (possibly William Evans Burton himself) criticized its borrowed descriptions of geography and errors in nautical information. The reviewer considered it a literary hoax and called it an \"impudent attempt at humbugging the public\" and regretted \"Mr. Poe's name in connexion with such a mass of ignorance and effrontery\". Poe later wrote to Burton that he agreed with the review, saying it \"was essentially correct\" and the novel was \"a very silly book\".Other reviews condemned the attempt at presenting a true story. A reviewer for the Metropolitan Magazine noted that, though the story was good as fiction, \"when palmed upon the public as a true thing, it cannot appear in any other light than that of a bungling business\u2014an impudent attempt at imposing on the credulity of the ignorant.\" Nevertheless, some readers believed portions of Poe's novel were true, especially in England, and justified the absurdity of the book with an assumption that author Pym was exaggerating the truth. Publisher George Putnam later noted that \"whole columns of these new 'discoveries', including the hieroglyphics (sic) found on the rocks, were copied by many of the English country papers as sober historical truth.\"In contrast, 20th-century Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, who admitted Poe as a strong influence, praised the novel as \"Poe's greatest work\". He later included one of the species invented for the story in his dictionary of fantastical creatures, the Book of Imaginary Beings, in a chapter titled \"an animal dreamt by Poe\". H. G. Wells noted that \"Pym tells what a very intelligent mind could imagine about the south polar region a century ago\". Even so, most scholars did not engage in much serious discussion or analysis of the novel until the 1950s, though many in France recognized the work much earlier. In 2013, The Guardian cited The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket as one of the 100 best novels written in English, and noted its influence on later authors such as Henry James, Arthur Conan Doyle, B. Traven and David Morrell.The financial and critical failure of The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket was a turning point in Poe's career. For one, he was driven to literary duties that would make him money, notably his controversial role as editor of The Conchologist's First Book in April 1839.

The work subsequently gained popularity, and seven more editions were printed in Freud's lifetime, the last in 1929.The classicist Norman O. Brown described The Interpretation of Dreams as one of the great applications and extensions of the Socratic maxim \"know thyself\" in Life Against Death (1959). The philosopher Paul Ric\u0153ur described The Interpretation of Dreams as Freud's \"first great book\" in Freud and Philosophy (1965). He argued that like Freud's other works it posits a \"semantics of desire\". The mythologist Joseph Campbell described the book as an \"epochal work\", noting in The Masks of God: Creative Mythology (1968) that it was \"based on insights derived from years devoted to the fantasies of neurotics\". Max Schur, Freud's physician and friend, provided evidence in Freud: Living and Dying (1972) that the first dream that Freud analyzed, his so-called \"Irma dream\", was not very disguised, but actually closely portrayed a medical disaster of Emma Eckstein, one of Freud's patients. The psychologist Hans Eysenck argued in Decline and Fall of the Freudian Empire (1985) that the dreams Freud cites actually disprove Freud's dream theory.The philosopher John Forrester described The Interpretation of Dreams as Freud's \"masterpiece\" in Dispatches from the Freud Wars (1997). He suggested that the book could be considered a form of autobiographical writing and compared it to the naturalist Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859). The philosopher Dermot Moran compared the influence that The Interpretation of Dreams exerted on psychoanalysis to that which the philosopher Edmund Husserl's Logical Investigations (1900\u20131901) exerted on 20th-century European philosophy in his introduction to the latter work.The philosopher Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen and the psychologist Sonu Shamdasani noted in The Freud Files (2012) that the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler wrote to Freud in October 1905 that he was convinced of the correctness of The Interpretation of Dreams as soon as he read it. They argued, however, that Freud's analysis of the dream of Irma's injection was partly based on Belgian psychologist Joseph Delboeuf's analysis of a dream in Sleep and Dreams. In their view, The Interpretation of Dreams should be placed in the context of the \"introspective hypnotism\" practiced by figures such as Auguste Forel, Eugen Bleuler, and Oskar Vogt. They charged Freud with selectively citing some authors on dreams (including Marie-Jean-L\u00e9on, Marquis d'Hervey de Saint Denys and Louis Ferdinand Alfred Maury), ignoring others (including Jean-Martin Charcot, Pierre Janet, and Richard von Krafft-Ebing), and systematically avoiding \"citing the passages in the works of his predecessors which came closest to his own theories.\"E. James Lieberman and Robert Kramer wrote in an introduction to a collection of letters between Freud and the psychoanalyst Otto Rank that Rank was impressed by The Interpretation of Dreams when he read it in 1905, and was moved to write a critical reanalysis of one of Freud's own dreams. They suggested that it may have been partly this reanalysis that brought Rank to Freud's attention. They noted that it was with Rank's help that Freud published the second edition of The Interpretation of Dreams in 1909. The neuropsychoanalyst Mark Blechner argued in Contemporary Psychoanalysis that even if one does not agree with Freud's theories, The Interpretation of Dreams remains a valuable record of dream texts and an analysis of the mental operations that dreams demonstrate. Art historian and filmmaker Joseph Koerner drew the title of his 2019 film The Burning Child from a dream of that title, which opens Chapter 7 of Interpretation of Dreams.

She had, with her husband, a London businessman named Francis, been for a number of years a visitor to Southwold in the summer and was on friendly terms with the Blairs.

Orwell complained that one passage that Gollancz asked be changed or cut was \"about the only good bit of writing in the book\". The title improvised by Gollancz, Confessions of a Down and Outer, bothered Orwell. \"Would The Confessions of a Dishwasher do as well?\" he asked Moore. \"I would rather answer to dishwasher than down & out.\" In July 1932, Orwell had suggested calling the book The Lady Poverty, in reference to a poem by Alice Meynell; in August 1932, he suggested In Praise of Poverty.

As a source of reference his Tetrabiblos is described as having \"enjoyed almost the authority of a Bible among the astrological writers of a thousand years or more\".  Compiled in Alexandria in the 2nd century, the work gathered commentaries about it from its first publication. It was translated into Arabic in the 9th century, and is described as \"by far the most influential source of medieval Islamic astrology\".With the translation of the Tetrabiblos into Latin in the 12th century, \"Ptolemaic astrology\" became integrated by Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas into medieval Christian doctrine. This theological acceptance encouraged the teaching of Ptolemaic astrology in universities, often linked to medical studies. This, in turn, brought attention in literary works, such as Dante's, which helped shape the moral, religious and cosmological paradigm of Western Europe during the Medieval era.  The Tetrabiblos was largely responsible for laying down  the basic precepts of Renaissance astrology, and was a necessary textbook in some of the finest universities of Renaissance and early modern Europe.\nPtolemaic astrology continued to be taught at European universities into the 17th century,  but by the mid-17th century the study struggled to maintain its position as one of the respected Liberal sciences. At this time, the contents of the Tetrabiblos started to draw stigmatisation as part of \"a diabolical art of divination\". One 17th-century critic was to write of its subject: \"no superstitious art is more fitted to forward the aims of the devil than the astrology of Ptolemy\".The intellectual standing of astrology collapsed rapidly at the end of the 17th century, but the historical impact of the Tetrabiblos upon world culture continues to engage the attention of scholars of classical philosophy and the history of sciences in antiquity. It also maintains its position as an influential textbook for practitioners of modern western astrology, and English translations of the text were published by astrologers in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. The early 20th-century Humanist astrologer Dane Rudhyar reported that the astrology of his era \"originated almost entirely in the work of the Alexandrian astrologer, Claudius Ptolemy\". Even 21st-century astrological textbooks have described the Tetrabiblos as being \"without a doubt, indispensable for any serious student of astrology\".The work's enduring significance is attributed to several factors: Ptolemy's reputation as one of the greatest philosophers and scientists of the ancient world, the text's astrological importance as one of the oldest complete manuals on that subject, and the unprecedented order and quality of Ptolemy's astrological explanations.The \"outstanding mark of Ptolemy\u2019s astrology\" is described as \"informed by the philosophical and scientific spirit of his age\". Ptolemy wrote at a time when \"physics\" was defined by philosophy, and his account of stellar effects was expressed in terms of the four Aristotelian qualities (hot, cold, wet, and dry) set against the philosophical notion of universal unity and cosmic harmony. His objective was to explain the rationale of astrology in such terms, so the work is also notable for its dismissal of astrological practices which lack a direct astronomical basis:\nAs for the nonsense on which many waste their labour and of which not even a plausible account can be given, this we shall dismiss in favour of the primary natural causes; we shall investigate, not by means of lots and numbers of which no reasonable explanation can be given, but merely through the science of the aspects of the stars to the places with which they have familiarity.\nThe book opens with an explanation of the philosophical framework of astrology which aims to answer the arguments of critics who questioned the subject's  validity.  Of this, Lynn Thorndike, in his History of Magic and Experimental Science, writes: \"Only the opponents of astrology appear to have remained ignorant of the Tetrabiblos, continuing to make criticisms of the art which do not apply to Ptolemy's presentation of it or which had been specifically answered by him\".Ptolemy was not responsible for originating the astrological techniques he presented in the Tetrabiblos.  His contribution was to arrange the material systematically, in order to demonstrate that astrology is based upon logical, hierarchical principles.  Astrological influences are frequently referred to the meteorological effects of humoral shifts, which were presumed to result from celestial cycles bringing correlated changes in the heating, cooling, moistening, and drying effects of the atmosphere.The historical importance and influence of the Tetrabiblos is attested by the many ancient, Medieval and Renaissance commentaries  published about it, as well as the many translations and paraphrased editions that aim to reproduce its content in an accessible manner. The Greek text has undergone transmission into Arabic, Latin and many modern languages. The first English translation did not appear until the 18th century, but by the end of the 19th century the American astrologer Luke Broughton reported he had at least half a dozen different English translations in his possession.", "hasanswer": false}]}

For the past five years, he has been married to Anna Petrovna, a disinherited Jewess, who has become very ill. Ivanov's estate is run by a distant relative, Mikhail Borkin, who is frequently advising people on how he can help them make money. The doctor, Lvov, an 'honest' man as he frequently reminds the rest of the cast, informs Ivanov that his wife is dying of tuberculosis, and that she needs to recover by going to the Crimea. Unfortunately, Ivanov is unable, and unwilling, to pay for the trip. He is heavily in debt and already owes Zinaida Lebedeva 9000 roubles. Ivanov is criticised for heartlessness and for spending time with the Lebedevs instead of his seriously ill wife. At the end of Act One, Ivanov departs to visit the Lebedevs, and unbeknown to him is followed by Anna and Lvov.\nAct Two shows a party at Lebedevs', and features various people discussing Ivanov. They say his only motive for marrying Anna was for the large dowry; however, when she married him, she was forced to convert from Judaism to Russian Orthodoxy and was disowned. Lebedev is married to Zinaida, who manages his money-lending, and they have a daughter, Sasha, who is infatuated with Ivanov. She throws herself at Ivanov and he is unable to resist: the act concludes with the two kissing. Unfortunately, Anna arrives unexpectedly at just this moment and witnesses the betrayal.\nAct Three shows a number of conversations between Ivanov and other members of the cast \u2013 Lebedev begs Ivanov to repay his debts, and Lvov confronts Ivanov once again about the heartless way he treats Anna. Sasha then appears, concerned by Ivanov's refusal to visit since the incident at the end of Act Two. The act then ends with Anna confronting Ivanov about Sasha's visit, and about how he has lied and cheated on her for the entirety of their marriage. Ivanov's anger is aroused by the false accusation and in a fit of anger he reveals to her that she is dying.\nAct Four occurs around a year after the previous acts. Anna has died, and Ivanov and Sasha are preparing to marry. As the wedding is about to begin, Lvov appears, planning to unveil Ivanov's 'evil' intentions \u2013 believing Ivanov is simply marrying Sasha for the dowry. He makes the accusation publicly and even though other characters have previously expressed doubts they all leap to Ivanov's defence and challenge Lvov to duels. Ivanov finds the whole situation amusing, returning to his old self, and takes out his gun. Sasha realises what he is about to do, but is unable to stop him: Ivanov runs away from the crowd and shoots himself, abruptly ending the play.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The fictional title character, a priestess and the daughter of Hamilcar Barca, the foremost Carthaginian general, is the object of the obsessive lust of Matho, a leader of the mercenaries. With the help of the scheming freed slave, Spendius, Matho steals the sacred veil of Carthage, the Za\u00efmph, prompting Salammb\u00f4 to enter the mercenaries' camp in an attempt to steal it back.  The Za\u00efmph is an ornate bejewelled veil draped about the statue of the goddess Tanit in the sanctum sanctorum of her temple: the veil is the city's guardian and touching it will bring death to the perpetrator.\n\nChapter 1. \"The Feast\".  \"It was at Megara, a suburb of Carthage, in the gardens of Hamilcar.\" The novel opens on a feast organized to celebrate the victory of the battle of Eryx, won against Rome. During the libations, the mercenaries ransack the place, spurred on by Hamilcar's absence, and the memories of the unkind and unfair way Carthage treated them throughout the war.  Salammb\u00f4, Hamilcar's daughter, appears. She scolds them for their actions and entreats them to enjoy the feast without destroying the place. Two men stare at her: Narr' Havas, a troop leader from Numidia and Hamilcar's guest, and Matho, a Libyan wearing a necklace with a moon pendent. The young woman hands Matho a glass full of wine and he drinks from it. A Gaulish soldier tells him that, where he is from, this is an offer of intimacy. Jealous, Narr' Havas throws a javelin and wounds him. In the scuffle that ensues, Salammb\u00f4 retreats to the palace, leaving Matho wondering. Spendius, a freed slave, tries to persuade Matho to take Carthage for the mercenaries.\nChapter 2. \"At Sicca\". Two days, later, after much pleading and promises of payment, the mercenaries agree to leave the city. They walk for seven days and reach the holy city of Sicca. On the way there, a line of crucified lions creates a sense of unease. There, Spendius realizes that Matho is haunted by the memory of Salammb\u00f4, with whom he has fallen in love. The shophet, Hanno, a fat, leprous man, is sent to explain to them that Carthage has no money and will be delaying payment of its debt. Since the shophet only speaks a Punic language, Spendius offers to translate for the army and misrepresents Hanno's message in order to set the mercenaries against him. To make matters worse, Zarxas arrives and relates the treacherous massacre of 300 slingers who had stayed behind. As the dignitary flees in shame, fearing for his life, Spendius convinces the mercenaries to go back to Carthage.\nChapter 3. \"Salammb\u00f4\". On a moonlit night, Salammb\u00f4 appears on a palace terrace. She invokes Tanit, the lunar goddess and the city's tutelary deity, whose moods and phases greatly influence her. Raised within the limits of the palace and destined to a political alliance, Salammb\u00f4 knows little, but as a priestess of Tanit, she wants to see the statue erected in the temple, in honor of the goddess. Schahabarim, a high priest, forbids it, as the sight of the statue is so powerful it might kill her. From afar, they catch sight of the mercenary army, closing in on Carthage.\nChapter 4. \"Beneath the Walls of Carthage\". The mercenaries besiege Carthage; Matho and Spendius penetrate via the aqueduct.\nChapter 5. \"Tanit\". Matho and Spendius steal the Za\u00efmph. Because Matho is caught while breaking into Salammb\u00f4's bedroom to see her again, she falls under suspicion of complicity.\nChapter 6. \"Hanno\". The mercenaries leave Carthage and split into two groups, attacking Utica and Hippo-Zarytus. Hanno surprises Spendius at Utica, and occupies the city, but flees when Matho arrives and routs his troops.\nChapter 7. \"Hamilcar Barca\". The hero returns and an attempt is made to blame him for Hanno's losses. He defends himself before the Council and defends the mercenaries, but turns against the barbarians when he sees the damage they have done to his property.\nChapter 8. \"The Battle of the Macar\". Hamilcar defeats Spendius at the bridge of the Macar river, three miles from Utica.\nChapter 9. \"In the Field\". Hamilcar's troops are trapped by the mercenaries.\nChapter 10. \"The Serpent\". Schahabarim sends Salammb\u00f4 in disguise to retrieve the Za\u00efmph.\nChapter 11. \"In the Tent\". Salammb\u00f4 reaches Matho in his tent at the encampment. Believing each other to be divine apparitions, they make love. The mercenaries are attacked and dispersed by Hamilcar's troops. She takes away the Za\u00efmph, and on meeting her father, Hamilcar has her betrothed to Narr' Havas, who has changed sides.\nChapter 12. \"The Aqueduct\". The Carthaginians return to their city with the mercenaries in pursuit. Spendius cuts off the water supply to Carthage.\nChapter 13. \"Moloch\". Carthaginian children are sacrificed to Moloch. Hamilcar disguises a slave-child as his son Hannibal and sends him to die in his son's place.\nChapter 14. \"The Defile of the Axe\". The drought is broken and aid comes. Hamilcar drives the mercenaries away from their encampments. Later, thousands of mercenaries are trapped in a defile and slowly starve (the Battle of \"The Saw\").

Koch Theater, Lincoln Center, for four performances in early January.\nIn June 2008, the Suzhou Kunqu Opera company performed The Peony Pavilion at Sadler's Wells, London, the UK premiere. It was presented in 3 parts on consecutive evenings, each lasting 3 hours, though still much shorter than the original 20 hours.\nIn May 2008, the National Ballet of China premi\u00e8red a two-scene ballet adaptation of The Peony Pavilion in Beijing. This production was rewritten and directed by Li Liuyi, choreographed by Fei Bo, and the music was composed by Guo Wenjing. It also attended Lincoln Center Festival in 2008, at David H. Koch Theater, and Edinburgh International Festival in August 2011.\nThe Imperial Granary's production The Peony Pavilion in Beijing, directed by Kunqu Opera master Wang Shiyu and scenography by the renowned Lin Zhaohua, was a permanent residency show for about 5 years since its premiere in 2007.\nIn 2004, Pai Hsien-yung's youth edition of The Peony Pavilion aims to rejuvenate the traditional staging. Pai, a Chinese scholar at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and his colleagues - scholars and performers, some brought back from retirement - spent five months editing Tang's script. Working out of the Jiangsu Suzhou Kunqu Theater, the group condensed and adapted the original fifty-five scenes to twenty-seven scenes, and twenty hours of performance time to nine. Bai, who had chosen The Peony Pavilion because of its universal message of love, hoped that his rendition would attract youth to Kunqu. In fact, in its tour of China's top universities, the show was marketed as the Youth Edition of Peony Pavilion.[1] (The production also toured in Taipei, Hong Kong, Macau, seven cities in mainland China, and the Zellerbach Theater in Berkeley, California.) According to Bai, the goal of this youth-oriented production was to \"give new life to the art form, cultivate a new generation of Kunqu aficionados, and offer respect to playwright Tang and all the master artists that came before.\"[2] His production of The Peony Pavilion was his way of doing so. Pai Hsien-yung has also used The Peony Pavilion as inspiration for a short story and a television script.\nRecent adaptations of The Peony Pavilion and allusions in popular music have revived interest in Kunqu, an art form that had been in danger of disappearing into obscurity. In 2001, UNESCO proclaimed Kunqu as a \"Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity,\" yet the secrets of that heritage were kept by only a few aging masters in even fewer schools and institutions.\nIn 1999, Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts produced a 20-hour version of The Peony Pavilion, directed by Chen and starring Qian Yi as Du Liniang. This 20-hour version was perhaps the first full-length staging in 300 years. Lincoln Center's version toured extensively, including New York, Paris, Milan, Singapore, Caen, Charleston, Aarhus, Berlin, Perth, and Vienna.[3]\nIn 1998, an experimental or \u201cavant-garde\u201d production of The Peony Pavilion composed by Tan Dun, directed by Peter Sellars, and performed by Kun Opera Troupe, premiered in Vienna and travelled to London, Roma, Paris, and Berkeley later.

Leaving most of his possessions to Takeda, Ueshiba left Shirataki with the apparent intention of returning to Tanabe to visit his ailing parent. En route he made a detour to Ayabe, near Kyoto, intending to visit Onisaburo Deguchi, the spiritual leader of the \u014cmoto-ky\u014d religion (Ueshiba's nephew Noriaki Inoue had already joined the religion and may have recommended it to his uncle). Ueshiba stayed at the \u014cmoto-ky\u014d headquarters for several days, and met with Deguchi, who told him that, \"There is nothing to worry about with your father\".:\u200a113\u200a On his return to Tanabe, Ueshiba found that Yoroku had died. Criticised by family and friends for arriving too late to see his father, Ueshiba went into the mountains with a sword and practised solo sword exercises for several days; this almost led to his arrest when the police were informed of a sword-wielding madman on the loose.:\u200a116\u200aWithin a few months, Ueshiba was back in Ayabe, having decided to become a full-time student of \u014cmoto-ky\u014d. In 1920 he moved his entire family, including his mother, to the \u014cmoto compound; at the same time he also purchased enough rice to feed himself and his family for several years.:\u200a117\u200a That same year, Deguchi asked Ueshiba to become the group's martial arts instructor, and a dojo\u2014the first of several that Ueshiba was to lead\u2014was constructed on the centre's grounds. Ueshiba also taught Takeda's Dait\u014d-ry\u016b in neighbouring Hy\u014dgo Prefecture during this period. His second son, Kuniharu, was born in 1920 in Ayabe, but died from illness the same year, along with three-year-old Takemori.:\u200a32\u201334\u200aTakeda visited Ueshiba in Ayabe to provide instruction, although he was not a follower of \u014cmoto and did not get along with Deguchi, which led to a cooling of the relationship between him and Ueshiba. Ueshiba continued to teach his martial art under the name \"Dait\u014d-ry\u016b Aiki-j\u016bjutsu\", at the behest of his teacher. However, Deguchi encouraged Ueshiba to create his own style of martial arts, \"Ueshiba-ry\u016b\", and sent many \u014cmoto followers to study at the dojo. He also brought Ueshiba into the highest levels of the group's bureaucracy, making Ueshiba his executive assistant and putting him in charge of the Showa Seinenkai (\u014cmoto-ky\u014d's national youth organisation) and the \u014cmoto Shobotai, a volunteer fire service.:\u200a118,\u200a128,\u200a137\u200aHis close relationship with Deguchi introduced Ueshiba to various members of Japan's far-right; members of the ultranationalist group the Sakurakai would hold meetings at Ueshiba's dojo, and he developed a friendship with the philosopher Sh\u016bmei \u014ckawa during this period, as well as meeting with Nissh\u014d Inoue and Kozabur\u014d Tachibana. Deguchi also offered Ueshiba's services as a bodyguard to Kingoro Hashimoto, the Sakurakai's founder.:\u200a142\u2013149\u200a Ueshiba's commitment to the goal of world peace, stressed by many biographers, must be viewed in the light of these relationships and his \u014cmoto-ky\u014d beliefs. His association with the extreme right-wing is understandable when one considers that \u014cmoto-ky\u014d's view of world peace was of a benevolent dictatorship by the Emperor of Japan, with other nations being subjugated under Japanese rule.:\u200a638\u2013639\u200aIn 1921, in an event known as the First \u014cmoto-ky\u014d Incident (\u5927\u672c\u4e8b\u4ef6, \u014cmoto jiken), the Japanese authorities raided the compound, destroying the main buildings on the site and arresting Deguchi on charges of l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9. Ueshiba's dojo was undamaged and, over the following two years, he worked closely with Deguchi to reconstruct the group's centre, becoming heavily involved in farming work and serving as the group's \"Caretaker of Forms\", a role which placed him in charge of overseeing \u014cmoto's move towards self-sufficiency.:\u200a154\u200a His son Kisshomaru was born in the summer of 1921.:\u200a32\u201334\u200aThree years later, in 1924, Deguchi led a small group of \u014cmoto-ky\u014d disciples, including Ueshiba, on a journey to Mongolia at the invitation of retired naval captain Yutaro Yano and his associates within the ultra-nationalist Black Dragon Society. Deguchi's intent was to establish a new religious kingdom in Mongolia, and to this end he had distributed propaganda suggesting that he was the reincarnation of Genghis Khan. Allied with the Mongolian bandit Lu Zhankui, Deguchi's group were arrested in Tongliao by the Chinese authorities. Fortunately for Ueshiba, whilst Lu and his men were executed by firing squad, the Japanese group was released into the custody of the Japanese consul. They were returned under guard to Japan, where Deguchi was imprisoned for breaking the terms of his bail.:\u200a37\u201345\u200a During this expedition Ueshiba was given the Chinese alias Wang Shou-gao, rendered in Japanese as \"Moritaka\" \u2013 he was reportedly very taken with this name and continued to use it intermittently for the rest of his life.:\u200a163\u200aAfter returning to Ayabe, Ueshiba began a regimen of spiritual training, regularly retreating to the mountains or performing misogi in the Nachi Falls. As his prowess as a martial artist increased, his fame began to spread. He was challenged by many established martial artists, some of whom later became his students after being defeated by him. In the autumn of 1925 he was asked to give a demonstration of his art in Tokyo, at the behest of Admiral Isamu Takeshita; one of the spectators was Yamamoto Gonnohy\u014de, who requested that Ueshiba stay in the capital to instruct the Imperial Guard in his martial art.

Skeptics completely doubt the existence of the apparitions, miracles and cures. Some mention that the apparitions have nothing to do with religion; others treat the events as a great staging. The Catholic Church itself seems to have been very cautious, not recognizing the apparitions as credible until October 1930. Cardinal Cerejeira stated that \"it was Fatima that imposed itself on the Church\".Father M\u00e1rio de Oliveira, author of some books on Fatima, commented that the God announced and revealed in the \"Memoirs of Sister Lucia\" \u2014 \"has nothing to do with the God revealed in Jesus of Nazareth. It has everything to do with a bloodthirsty God who delights in the suffering of the innocent, a God who creates hell to punish those who fail to go to Mass on sundays or say bad words, a God who is even worse than some of his creatures.\" He notes that Jacinta and Francisco were capable of going entire days without eating, or drinking a drop of water, even in the middle of August, and walking around all day, and even in their sleep at night, with a rope permanently tied to their waist,  in what the author calls \"religious masochism\". About L\u00facia, the writer says that she was taken from her homeland and forever prevented from leading a life in any way similar to that of common people (she was secretly interned in the Vilar Asylum in Porto, and then she was sent to Spain and made a cloistered nun for the rest of her life). Alfredo Barroso, journalist  and  politician, claims that the \"Miracle of Fatima\" never existed, and that it is a \"product of illiteracy, ignorance and the beliefs of three children terrorised by the image of a cruel, vengeful and punishing God\". For Barroso, the \"miracle of Fatima\" became a weapon to hurl against the Republic, freedom and democracy, against atheism and communism, in a classic alliance between \"the sword and the hyssop\" under the aegis of the dictator Salazar.Tom\u00e1s da Fonseca, author of some books on the subject and one of F\u00e1tima's fiercest critics, considers it \"the biggest hoax of this century\".

Although the Khalif has offered a reward for his capture, the roguish Sinbad ignores Omar's warnings and nonchalantly sneaks into the palace. Spouting Omar's poetry, Sinbad romances Nerissa, one of the Khalif's harem girls but is exposed by a slave.\nBoth Sinbad and Omar are caught and brought before the Khalif for sentencing. Also on trial are Greek scholar Simon Aristides, and his daughter Kristina, Sinbad's childhood friend, who has been wrongfully accused of stealing. After the Khalif orders that Sinbad and Omar be executed, his advisor, Jiddah, persuades him to meet with Murad, the ambassador to Tamerlane, a Tartar leader whose forces are threatening to invade Baghdad. Murad boldly informs the Khalif that the Tartars will soon be storming the city and demands that he and his men be entertained in the meantime.\nAnxious to save Kristina, Sinbad reveals to the Khalif that Simon possesses the formula for an explosive called \"Greek fire\" and will share it with the Khalif in exchange for Simon's, Kristina's, Omar's and his freedom. The Khalif refuses to release Sinbad and Omar, but while they are incarcerated in the dungeon, Simon and Kristina give the ruler a private demonstration of Greek fire.\nAs protection, Simon has entrusted the formula to Kristina, who can recite the instructions only while hypnotized. In front of the Khalif, Simon hypnotizes Kristina, who then gives her father directions for mixing the various bottled ingredients. Unknown to them, Jiddah is in cahoots with Murad, and both men are eavesdropping on the proceedings. Although Jiddah and Murad can hear Kristina telling her father how much of each item to use, they cannot ascertain the chemicals being poured by Simon.\nMeanwhile, the Khalif, ecstatic about the explosive, agrees to Simon's demand that Sinbad and Omar be freed in the morning. That night, Kristina confides in Ameer that she wants to marry Sinbad and asks her to tell him about his imminent release. Although jealous, Ameer delivers the message to Sinbad, but when she returns to Kristina's chambers, she finds Kristina gone and Simon murdered. Ameer sees Murad fleeing with Kristina and Simon's chemicals and sends a message via carrier pigeon before being caught by Jiddah.\nWhile torturing Ameer to reveal the bird's destination, Jiddah notices that she has a Forty Thieves tattoo on her shoulder. Although the Thieves, a band of raiders once led by Sinbad's father, are now dead, Ameer admits that their heirs have banded together, and Jiddah deduces that the message went to them. At dawn, Sinbad and Omar learn that their execution is to proceed as scheduled, but they escape the dungeon and fight their way to the Khalif's chambers. There, Sinbad offers to retrieve Kristina in exchange for his and Omar's freedom, some gold and a promise that he will be made second in command in Bagdad. The Khalif agrees and Sinbad rides off with Omar, unaware that Jiddah, having heard his exchange with the Khalif, is alerting Murad of his plan.\nLater, while resting in the desert, Sinbad and Omar are joined by Ameer, who reveals that Murad and his men are traveling in disguise with a caravan of merchants and that the Forty Thieves will attack them at first camp. Omar and Sinbad ride to the camp ahead of the caravan, and Sinbad has Omar bury him in the spot where he thinks Kristina's tent will be placed. Breathing through a reed, Sinbad remains buried in the Tartars' camp, far from Kristina's tent, until Murad unwittingly plucks his reed from the sand. Sinbad is forced to surface but manages to sneak into Kristina's tent and free her.\nAs Sinbad, Omar and Kristina ride off, the Forty Thieves, who are all women, attack the camp and reclaim Simon's bottles. Omar, Sinbad and Kristina then go to the Forty Thieves's cave and, using the cry \"open sesame,\" signals a donkey named Sesame to open the \"door.\" After arranging with Ghenia, the raiders' leader, Sinbad reunites with Ameer, but when he refuses to have \"eyes only for her,\" Ameer rejects him. Just then, Murad's men advance on the cave, and Sinbad quickly hypnotizes Kristina, who has fallen in love with Omar, and concocts some Greek fire using Simon's chemicals. Hurling torches coated with the explosive, the Thieves, Sinbad and Omar cripple Murad and his men. Sinbad then defeats Murad in a sword fight, and victory is declared. Later, Sinbad convinces the women to go with him to Bagdad and make peace with the Khalif. At the palace, the Khalif waits for Sinbad with Jiddah, whose duplicity he has yet to realize, preparing to execute him for failing his mission.\nWhen Sinbad appears with Kristina and a bevy of beautiful raiders, however, the Khalif embraces him and orders Jiddah to be de-tongued. At Sinbad's behest, Omar is made the royal poet, the Thieves are pardoned, and Sinbad is installed as second in command.

The Zulu-dominated Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) initially opposed parts of the new constitution advocated by the African National Congress (ANC) regarding the internal governance of KwaZulu. In particular, the IFP campaigned aggressively for an autonomous and sovereign Zulu king, as constitutional head of state. As a result, the IFP abstained from registering its party for the 1994 election until the king's  role in the new democracy is  clarified. Mandela and president De Klerk arranged a special meeting where it was agreed that international mediators would be called to try and sort out the issue of a king. As a result, the IFP was registered for the elections. It demonstrated its political strength by taking the majority of the provincial votes for KwaZulu-Natal in the said election.\nAlthough the constitution makes the role of the King largely ceremonial, it is incumbent upon him to act on the official advice of the provincial premier. On occasion, South African President Nelson Mandela made efforts to bypass the IFP in negotiating with the Zulus, instead making direct overtures to the King (Mandela's daughter, Zeni, is married to Prince Thumbumuzi Dlamini, a brother of King Zwelithini's Great Wife, Queen Mantfombi). Nonetheless, the IFP remained in power in the province until 2003.\nDuring most of the King's reign, his cousin (uncle in Zulu African reckoning), Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Prince of KwaPhindangene and founder/head of IFP, was the Zulu prime minister. But, in September 1994, tension between the previously allied kinsmen peaked publicly as the annual Shaka Zulu celebration approached. Rumours that the King was manoeuvring to replace Buthelezi as Zulu prime minister with former regent Prince Mcwayizeni, who had joined the ANC in 1990, seemed likely after the King announced that Buthelezi would no longer be his chief advisor, and simultaneously cancelled the holiday ceremony. For his safety, federal troops escorted King Zwelithini by helicopter to Johannesburg. Although Buthelezi was then serving as Minister of Home Affairs in South Africa's Cabinet, President Mandela's efforts to broker a reconciliation failed. Buthelezi moved the event from Nongoma to Stanger, and addressed a throng of 10,000 of his Zulu supporters.\nSubsequently, the King's spokesman, Prince Sifiso Zulu, was being interviewed on television at the South African Broadcasting Corporation's studio when Buthelezi and his bodyguards forcibly interrupted the programme, physically intimidating Prince Sifiso. The televised incident drew national attention and a public rebuke from Mandela, prompting Buthelezi to apologise to the Zulu Royal Family, Cabinet and nation for his behaviour. Relations between Zwelithini and Buthelezi later improved.\nKing Zwelithini has cooperated as the law requires with the ANC since it took over the reins of government in KwaZulu-Natal. The King's finances are controlled by KwaZulu-Natal provincial authorities.\nIn 1989 he criticized the ANC leadership for not inviting him and Buthelezi to a rally welcoming back the Rivonia Trial defendants, who had been released after almost three decades of imprisonment.\n\nAs the constitutional monarch of the kingdom of KwaZulu-Natal, he was head of the Ubukhosi, the state-recognized institution of Traditional Leadership that consists of local chiefs. His leadership role also entailed chairmanship of the Usuthu Tribal Authority and Nongoma Regional Authority, both established under the provisions of the KwaZulu Amakhosi and Iziphakanyiswa Act. In his address upon the opening of the Provincial Parliament on 28 September 2003, the King advised the government and legislators to give more heed to the Ubukhosi: Traditional Leaders are neither consulted nor involved in the process of formulating policies that have a direct bearing on their day to day activities. The institution of Ubukhosi has been in existence from time immemorial and has survived many hardships under past colonial regimes. From the point of view of the ordinary citizen, an Inkosi's most important role may lie in his symbolizing of community solidarity. So any notion that the institution of Ubukhosi, now that we have a democratic government in place, can just be wished away, remains a pipe-dream. Some countries just across our borders had decided to do away with the institution of traditional leadership immediately after attaining independence from colonial rulers. However, they have since realised that they had committed gross mistakes and were now re-inventing these institutions at great costs. As King of the Zulu Nation I am proud of the role played by the Prime Minister of the Zulu Nation, Prince of KwaPhindangene, Dr MG Buthelezi who had singlehandedly championed the cause of the Institution of Traditional Leadership in this country.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Because of the rough nature of the work, Marxist anthropologist David Harvey has described challenges in \"determining whether Marx is advancing his own conceptual framework and interpretations or simply reporting for others\" and stated that \"Marx is, in short, just talking to himself\". It is often described as the rough draft of Das Kapital, although there is considerable disagreement about the exact relationship between the two texts, particularly around the issue of methodology.Due to its breadth and its incorporation of themes from Marx's earlier writings, the Grundrisse is central to Marx's body of work. Its subject matter includes the prices of production, relations of production, distribution, exchange, alienation, value, labor, capitalism, the rise of technology and automation, pre-capitalist forms of social organization, and the preconditions for a communist revolution. Scholars have noted major differences between Marx's earlier writings, such as The German Ideology and The Communist Manifesto, and the later ones, Das Kapital and Grundrisse, suggesting that Marx's views evolved, though the main themes remained the same.As Martin Nicolaus and others have argued, the Grundrisse is crucial for understanding Marx's mature analysis of capitalism, even though, historically, it has been far less influential in the development of the various strands of Marxist theory than earlier texts such as the Communist Manifesto, the Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844, and The German Ideology.  Towards the end of his life, Marx, according to Nicolaus, viewed the latter \u201cwith a scepticism bordering on rejection.\u201d  The Grundrisse, on the other hand, was one of the few texts which Marx spoke of \u201cwith a tone of achievement and a sense of accomplishment.\u201d If this is true, the main reason is possibly that the more substantive first part of The German Ideology was largely written by Friedrich Engels while the subsequent parts, satirizing the linguistic apostasies and word-mongering of Left-Hegelian philosophers, were written by Marx himself.French philosopher Louis Althusser believed that Marx's thought had been misunderstood and underestimated. He condemned various interpretations of Marx\u2014such as historicism, idealism, and economism\u2014on the grounds that they fail to realise that Marx's \"science of history\", historical materialism, represents a revolutionary view of social change. Althusser believed these errors to result from the notion (mistaken in his view) that Marx's entire body of work forms a coherent whole. Althusser proffered a radical \"epistemological break\" in Marx's thought, which can be seen by comparing the unpublished Grundrisse and Das Kapital.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Laws 759d) about how to proceed. Socrates is astonished by Euthyphro's confidence in being able to prosecute his own father for the serious charge of manslaughter, despite the fact that Athenian Law allows only relatives of the dead man to file suit for murder (Dem. 43 \u00a757). Euthyphro dismisses the astonishment of Socrates, which confirms his overconfidence in his own critical judgment of religious and ethical matters.\nIn an example of Socratic irony, Socrates says that Euthyphro obviously has a clear understanding of what is pious or holy (\u03c4\u1f78 \u1f45\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd to hosion) and impious or unholy (\u03c4\u1f78 \u1f00\u03bd\u03cc\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd to anosion). Because he is facing a formal charge of impiety, Socrates expresses the hope to learn from Euthyphro, all the better to defend himself in the trial, as he himself is being accused of religious transgressions.\nEuthyphro says that what lies behind the charge of impiety presented against Socrates, by Meletus and the others, is Socrates' claim that he is subjected to a daimon (divine sign), which warns him of various courses of action (3b). From the perspective of some Athenians, Socrates expressed skepticism of the accounts about the Greek gods, which he and Euthyphro briefly discuss, before proceeding to the main argument of their dialogue: the definition of \"piety\". Moreover, Socrates further expresses critical reservations about such divine accounts that emphasize the cruelty and inconsistent behaviour of the Greek gods, such as the castration of the early sky-god Uranus, by his son Cronus; a story Socrates said is difficult to accept (6a\u20136c).\nAfter claiming to know and be able to tell more astonishing divine stories, Euthyphro spends little time and effort defending the conventional Greek view of the gods. Instead, he is led to the true task at hand, as Socrates forces him to confront his ignorance by pressing Euthyphro for a definition of \"piety\"; yet, Socrates finds flaw with each definition of \"piety\" proposed by Euthyphro (6d ff.).\nAt the dialogue's conclusion, Euthyphro is compelled to admit that each of his definitions of \"piety\" has failed, but, rather than correct his faulty logic, he says that it is time for him to leave, and excuses himself from their dialogue. To that end, Socrates concludes the dialogue with Socratic irony: Since Euthyphro was unable to define \"piety\", Euthyphro has failed to teach Socrates about piety. Therefore, from his dialogue with Euthyphro, Socrates received nothing helpful to his defense against a formal charge of impiety (15c ff.).\nIt is easier to understand Socrates' arguments in this dialogue if the reader keeps in mind that Athenian religion revolved around specific rituals and practices with no reference to sacred scripture, at least in the same sense as later Abrahamic religions. Priests might worship only one specific god while not paying respect to the others. Euthyphro uses Zeus as evidence for his notions of piety while disregarding Uranus and Cronus, for example.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Through the years, different Baptist groups have issued confessions of faith\u2014without considering them to be creeds\u2014to express their particular doctrinal distinctions in comparison to other Christians as well as in comparison to other Baptists. Baptist denominations are traditionally seen as belonging to two parties, General Baptists who uphold Arminian theology, and Particular Baptists who uphold Reformed theology (Calvinism). During the holiness movement, some General Baptists accepted the teaching of a second work of grace and formed denominations that emphasized this belief, such as the Ohio Valley Association of the Christian Baptist Churches of God and the Holiness Baptist Association. Most Baptists are evangelical in doctrine, but their beliefs may vary due to the congregational governance system that gives autonomy to individual local Baptist churches. Historically, Baptists have played a key role in encouraging religious freedom and separation of church and state.Shared doctrines would include beliefs about one God; the virgin birth of Jesus; miracles; substitutionary atonement for sins through the death, burial, and bodily resurrection of Jesus; the Trinity; the need for salvation (through belief in Jesus Christ as the Son of God, his death and resurrection); grace; the Kingdom of God; last things (eschatology) (Jesus Christ will return personally and visibly in glory to Earth; the dead will be raised; and Christ will judge everyone in righteousness); and evangelism and missions.\nMost Baptists hold that no church or ecclesiastical organization has inherent authority over a Baptist church. Churches can properly relate to each other under this polity only through voluntary cooperation, never by any sort of coercion. Furthermore, this Baptist polity calls for freedom from governmental control. Exceptions to this local form of local governance include a few churches that submit to the leadership of a body of elders, as well as the Episcopal Baptists who have an Episcopal system.\nBaptists generally believe in the literal Second Coming of Christ. Beliefs among Baptists regarding the \"end times\" include amillennialism, both dispensational and historic premillennialism, with views such as postmillennialism and preterism receiving some support.\nSome additional distinctive Baptist principles held by many Baptists::\u200a2\u200a\nThe supremacy of the canonical Scriptures as a norm of faith and practice. For something to become a matter of faith and practice, it is not sufficient for it to be merely consistent with and not contrary to scriptural principles. It must be something explicitly ordained through command or example in the Bible. For instance, this is why Baptists do not practice infant baptism: they say the Bible neither commands nor exemplifies infant baptism as a Christian practice. More than any other Baptist principle, this one when applied to infant baptism is said to separate Baptists from other evangelical Christians.\nBaptists believe that faith is a matter between God and the individual (religious freedom). To them it means the advocacy of absolute liberty of conscience.\nInsistence on immersion believer's baptism as the only mode of baptism. Baptists do not believe that baptism is necessary for salvation. Therefore, for Baptists, baptism is an ordinance, not a sacrament, since in their view it imparts no saving grace.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Though normally collected and bound with Caesar's authentic writings, their authorship has been debated since antiquity.

Slightly later a second, and very different Greek translation was made, in the form of 1 Esdras, from which the deeds of Nehemiah are entirely absent, those sections either being omitted or re-attributed to Ezra instead; and initially early Christians reckoned this later translation as their biblical 'Book of Ezra', as had the 1st century Jewish writer Josephus. From the third century the Christian Old Testament in Greek supplemented the text of 1 Esdras with the older translation of Ezra-Nehemiah, naming the two books Esdras A and Esdras B respectively; and this usage is noted by the 3rd century Christian scholar Origen, who remarked that the Hebrew 'book of Ezra' might then be considered a 'double' book. Jerome, writing in the early 5th century, noted that this duplication had since been adopted by Greek and Latin Christians. Jerome himself rejected the duplication in his Vulgate translation of the Bible into Latin from the Hebrew; and consequently all early Vulgate manuscripts present Ezra-Nehemiah as a single book, as too does the 8th century commentary of Bede, and the 9th century bibles of Alcuin and Theodulf of Orleans. However, sporadically from the 9th century onwards, Latin bibles are found that separate the Ezra and Nehemiah sections of Ezra\u2013Nehemiah as two distinct books, then called the first and second books of Ezra; and this becomes standard in the Paris Bibles of the 13th century.

Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Nel also contends that Geisel identified with the Cat, pointing to a self portrait of Geisel in which he appears as the Cat, which was published alongside a profile about him in The Saturday Evening Post on July 6, 1957. Michael K. Frith, who worked as Geisel's editor, concurs, arguing that \"The Cat in the Hat and Ted Geisel were inseparable and the same. I think there's no question about it. This is someone who delighted in the chaos of life, who delighted in the seeming insanity of the world around him.\" Ruth MacDonald asserts that the Cat's primary goal in the book is to create fun for the children. The Cat calls it \"fun that is funny\", which MacDonald distinguishes from the ordinary, serious fun that parents subject their children to. In an article titled \"Was the Cat in the Hat Black?\", Philip Nel draws connections between the Cat and stereotyped depictions of African-Americans, including minstrel shows, Geisel's own minstrel-inspired cartoons from early in his career, and the use of the term \"cat\" to refer to jazz musicians. According to Nel, \"Even as [Geisel] wrote books designed to challenge prejudice, he never fully shed the cultural assumptions he grew up with, and was likely unaware of the ways in which his visual imagination replicated the racial ideologies he consciously sought to reject.\"\nGeisel once called the fish \"my version of Cotton Mather\", the Puritan moralist who advised the prosecutors during the Salem witch trials. Betty Mensch and Alan Freeman support this view, writing, \"Drawing on old Christian symbolism (the fish was an ancient sign of Christianity) Dr. Seuss portrays the fish as a kind of ever-nagging superego, the embodiment of utterly conventionalized morality.\" Philip Nel notes that other critics have also compared the fish to the superego. Anna Quindlen called the Cat \"pure id\" and marked the children, as mediators between the Cat and the fish, as the ego. Mensch and Freeman, however, argue that the Cat shows elements of both id and ego.In her analysis of the fish, MacDonald asserts that it represents the voice of the children's absent mother. Its conflict with the Cat, not only over the Cat's uninvited presence but also their inherent predator-prey relationship, provides the tension of the story. She points out that on the last page, while the children are hesitant to tell their mother about what happened in her absence, the fish gives a knowing look to the readers to assure them \"that something did go on but that silence is the better part of valor in this case\". Alison Lurie agrees, writing, \"there is a strong suggestion that they might not tell her.\" She argues that, in the Cat's destruction of the house, \"the kids\u2014and not only those in the story, but those who read it\u2014have vicariously given full rein to their destructive impulses without guilt or consequences.\" For a 1983 article, Geisel told Jonathan Cott, \"The Cat in the Hat is a revolt against authority, but it's ameliorated by the fact that the Cat cleans up everything at the end. It's revolutionary in that it goes as far as Kerensky and then stops. It doesn't go quite as far as Lenin.\"Donald Pease notes that The Cat in the Hat shares some structural similarities with other Dr. Seuss books. Like earlier books, The Cat in the Hat starts with \"a child's feeling of discontent with his mundane circumstances\" which is soon enhanced by make-believe. The book starts in a factual, realistic world, which crosses over into the world of make-believe with the loud bump that heralds the arrival of the Cat. However, this is the first Dr. Seuss book in which the fantasy characters, i.e. the Cat and his companions, are not products of the children's imagination. It also differs from previous books in that Sally and her brother actively participate in the fantasy world; they also have a new opinion of the Cat and his world by the story's end.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The two gather sticks from the other side of a fence to build Eeyore's house. Unbeknownst to Pooh and Piglet, Eeyore had collected those sticks during the morning so that he could build a house. During this time, Eeyore visits Christopher Robin. Upon his return, Eeyore finds that the stick pile is missing. Ultimately, Eeyore believes that the wind blew the sticks there as a house, and Pooh and Piglet are happy and leave to have lunch with Christopher Robin.\nIn Which Tigger Comes to the Forest and Has Breakfast\nDuring one night, Pooh hears a mysterious sound outside his house. Upon investigation, Pooh discovers a new animal has come to the forest, Tigger. Tigger stays the night at Pooh's upon invitation. In the morning, the two share breakfast but Tigger dislikes honey. They then go to Piglet's, Eeyore's, and Christopher Robin's but they do not discover anything that Tigger likes. Finally they end up at Kanga and Roo's where Tigger discovers that he likes malt. Kanga and Roo then invite Tigger to live with them.\nIn Which a Search Is Organized, and Piglet Nearly Meets the Heffalump Again\nPooh is counting his honey jars when Rabbit stops by. Rabbit's relation, Small, has disappeared, so Rabbit organizes a search party. As the search happens, Piglet feels frightened by potentially meeting a Heffalump. Pooh fell into a hole during the search, which Piglet later falls into. As Christopher Robin helps them to climb out, Piglet notices that Small was on Pooh's back. The search ends, but Eeyore is not notified for two days.\nIn Which It Is Shown That Tiggers Don't Climb Trees\nWhile visiting together, Pooh and Piglet decide to go and see Tigger and Roo. Upon arriving at Kanga's, she explains that they are exploring the forest together. Pooh and Piglet decide to go and search for them. During this time, Roo asks what skills Tigger has, and Tigger replies that he can climb, jump, and swim. Upon reaching a tall tree, Tigger, with Roo on his back, climbs up it. However, once at the top, Tigger becomes scared and is unable to climb down. While searching, Pooh and Piglet hear sounds coming from high up, believing that it is \"jagulars\". They discover that it is Tigger and Roo, and the two get Christopher Robin's help. Tigger and Roo get down by jumping into Christopher Robin's extended tunic that Pooh, Piglet, Rabbit, and Eeyore hold.\nIn Which Rabbit Has a Busy Day, and We Learn What Christopher Robin Does in the Mornings\nWhile trying to visit Christopher Robin, Rabbit discovers that he is gone. Rabbit takes the note that Christopher Robin left over to Owl's where the two decipher that Christopher Robin is spending time with a \"Backson\". Rabbit then visits Pooh who is writing poetry, and the two wonder what Christopher Robin does during the morning. Rabbit encounters Piglet who explains that he picked violets that morning, and then brought some to Eeyore. Eeyore made an \"A\" out of sticks, and said that Christopher Robin taught him that. This is how they learned that Christopher Robin does education during the mornings.\nIn Which Pooh Invents a New Game and Eeyore Joins In\nWhile sitting on a bridge, Pooh, Piglet, Rabbit, and Roo invent a new game called \"Poohsticks\". The game involves dropping sticks on one side of the bridge and seeing which stick comes across first. While playing a round, Eeyore comes drifting out from under the bridge. The group helps get Eeyore out of the water, and he explains that Tigger bounced him in. Tigger denies this accusation, and states that coughed and did not bounce. Christopher Robin comes along during the argument and settles it before the group plays the game again. Tigger is very good at the game, and he teaches Eeyore his special technique.\nIn Which Tigger Is Unbounced\nAnnoyed by Tigger's bouncing, Rabbit, along with Pooh and Piglet, concocts a scheme to get Tigger to stop. Rabbit plans to take Tigger deep into the forest and lose him so that he will then be sad and quiet and stop bouncing. However, Tigger finds his way out while Rabbit, Pooh, and Piglet are lost instead. With Christopher Robin's help, Tigger finds the trio, and Rabbit is the sad and quiet one.\nIn Which Piglet Does a Very Grand Thing\nOn a very windy day, Piglet and Pooh visit Owl. While visiting him, his tree house gets blown over by the wind trapping the trio inside. In a moment of bravery, Piglet finds a way to escape through a tiny crevice. Piglet goes off to find Christopher Robin who will help get Pooh and Owl out. While Piglet is away, Owl begins telling Pooh a story about his uncle. Pooh dozes off during the story.\nIn Which Eeyore Finds the Wolery, and Owl Moves into It\nDue to his house falling over, Owl needs to find a new home and he solicits the help of the other animals in the forest. Eeyore had not been informed about Owl's house falling, but he goes out to search for a new one. Pooh meets with Piglet and reinforces how brave Piglet was before they meet with everyone, minus Eeyore, at Owl's house where furniture is being salvaged. Eeyore then comes along and explains that he has found Owl a new house. The house he found is actually Piglet's, but Piglet willingly gives it up. After this, Pooh offers to have Piglet move in with him, which Piglet accepts.\nIn Which Christopher Robin and Pooh Come to an Enchanted Place, and We Leave Them There\nChristopher Robin has to leave the forest, so all of the animals sign a poem that Eeyore has written. Upon taking it to Christopher Robin he begins to read it, and as he does each animal leaves little by little until just Pooh remains. The two go off to the Enchanted Place in the forest where Christopher Robin \"knights\" Pooh as Sir Pooh de Bear. Christopher Robin then explains that he has to leave and he cannot do \"nothing\" anymore, but he hopes that Pooh will come and sit in the Enchanted Place even when he has gone.

Going into the last verse, the song's key shifts up to F minor and later towards the end, \"the backing track falls into silence and [Osmond's] vocals come to the fore.\" Osmond's vocal range spans one octave, from D3 To G#4 Beginning with two verses, followed by a bridge, a refrain, a final verse and repeated choruses, the song is a total of three minutes and twenty-one seconds in length.Entertainment Weekly identified the number as the film's \"rambunctious peak.\" According to Victoria Flanagan, author of Into the Closet: Gender and Cross-dressing in Children's Fiction: Cross-Dressing and the Gendered Body in Children's Literature and Film, \"I'll Make a Man Out of You\" is \"a playful parody of conventional masculinity.\" USA Today's Hannah Yasharoff described the song as \"a tongue-in-cheek comment on sexism\". Lyrically, Zippel described the track as a song about \"hyper-masculinity\" that is disturbed by \"the whole idea of Mulan\", identifying the song as an opportunity \"to have those two issues head-to-head.\" The lyric \"I'll make a man out of you\" is constantly repeated and reinforced by Shang. According to author John Stephens of Ways of Being Male: Representing Masculinities in Children's Literature, the song's lyrics \"initially define masculinity in opposition to femininity,\" with its first verse beginning, Let's get down to business \nTo defeat the Huns / Did they send me daughters / When l asked for sons ?\" Its chorus reads, Be a man We must be swift as the coursing  river / Be a man With all the force  of a great typhoon / Be a man With all the strength of a raging fire / Mysterious as the dark side of the moon \" which, according to Ways of Being Male: Representing Masculinities in Children's Literature, \"essentializes masculinity by asserting that it embodies the speed, strength and power of the natural world, and yet contains this within an aura of tranquility and mystery.\" According to Beyond Adaptation: Essays on Radical Transformations of Original Works, these lyrics \"add a hint of darkness as they celebrate male prowess\" by suggesting that one who has \"acquired fiery strength\" is also \"untamed as the moon's dark side.\" According to The Phoenix, Osmond performs the song's lyrics with \"grit.\" Meanwhile, the singer is backed up by a macho-sounding choir repeatedly chanting \"Be a man!\", a call and response preceded by three chords intertwined with lyrics such as \"you must be swift as the coursing river\" and \"with all the force of a great typhoon.\" Entertainment Weekly's Maureen Lee Lenker identified the \"Be a man\" chorus as the song's most iconic moment.", "hasanswer": false}]}

By the conclusion of 1876, it had seen two reprints, with a total of 18,000 or 19,000 copies circulating. In total, the poem was reprinted seventeen times between 1876 and 1908.The Hunting of the Snark received largely mixed reviews from Carroll's contemporary reviewers. The Academy's Andrew Lang criticised Carroll's decision to use poetry instead of prose and its too appealing title. The Athenaeum described it as \"the most bewildering of modern poetry\", wondering \"if he has merely been inspired to reduce to idiotcy as many readers and more especially reviewers, as possible\". According to Vanity Fair, Carroll's work had progressively worsened after Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865), with The Hunting of the Snark being the worst of his works and \"not worthy [of] the name of nonsense\". While The Spectator  wrote that the poem's final line had the potential to become a proverb, it criticised the poem as \"a failure\" that might have succeeded with more work from the author. The Saturday Review wrote that the poem offered \"endless speculation\" as to the true identity of the Snark, although the unnamed reviewer felt that the familiar nature of Carroll's nonsense weakened its effect for the reader. Conversely, The Graphic praised the poem as a welcome departure from the Alice books, and called it \"a glorious piece of nonsense\", that could appeal to all Alice fans.\"The Hunting of the Snark\" has in common some elements with Carroll's other works. It shares its author's love of puns on the word \"fit\" with Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and mentions of \"candle-ends\" and \"toasted cheese\" with his supernatural poem Phantasmagoria. Additionally all three works include the number \"42\".

Despite its slow beginnings, later critics have praised it as an American classic that explores natural simplicity, harmony, and beauty. The American poet Robert Frost wrote of Thoreau, \"In one book ... he surpasses everything we have had in America\".It is often assumed that critics initially ignored Walden, and that those who reviewed the book were evenly split or slightly more negative than positive in their assessment of it. But, researchers have shown that Walden actually was \"more favorably and widely received by Thoreau's contemporaries than hitherto suspected\". Of the 66 initial reviews that have been found so far, 46 \"were strongly favorable\". Some reviews were rather superficial, merely recommending the book or predicting its success with the public; others were more lengthy, detailed, and nuanced with both positive and negative comments. Positive comments included praise for Thoreau's independence, practicality, wisdom, \"manly simplicity\", and fearlessness. Less than three weeks after the book's publication, Thoreau's mentor Ralph Waldo Emerson proclaimed, \"All American kind are delighted with Walden as far as they have dared to say.\"On the other hand, the terms \"quaint\" or \"eccentric\" appeared in over half of the book's initial reviews. Other terms critical of Thoreau included selfish, strange, impractical, privileged (or \"manor born\"), and misanthropic. One review compared and contrasted Thoreau's form of living to communism, probably not in the sense of Marxism, but instead of communal living or religious communism. While valuing freedom from possessions, Thoreau was not communal in the sense of practicing sharing or of embracing community. So, communism \"is better than our hermit's method of getting rid of encumbrance\".In contrast to Thoreau's \"manly simplicity\", nearly twenty years after Thoreau's death Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson judged Thoreau's endorsement of living alone in natural simplicity, apart from modern society, to be a mark of effeminacy, calling it \"womanish solicitude; for there is something unmanly, something almost dastardly\" about the lifestyle. Poet John Greenleaf Whittier criticized what he perceived as the message in Walden that man should lower himself to the level of a woodchuck and walk on four legs. He said: \"Thoreau's Walden is a capital reading, but very wicked and heathenish ... After all, for me, I prefer walking on two legs\". Author Edward Abbey criticized Thoreau's ideas and experiences at Walden in detail throughout his response to Walden called \"Down the River with Thoreau\", written in 1980.Today, despite these criticisms, Walden stands as one of America's most celebrated works of literature. John Updike wrote of Walden, \"A century and a half after its publication, Walden has become such a totem of the back-to-nature, preservationist, anti-business, civil-disobedience mindset, and Thoreau so vivid a protester, so perfect a crank and hermit saint, that the book risks being as revered and unread as the Bible.\" The American psychologist B. F. Skinner wrote that he carried a copy of Walden with him in his youth, and eventually wrote Walden Two in 1945, a fictional utopia about 1,000 members who live together in a Thoreau-inspired community.Kathryn Schulz has accused Thoreau of hypocrisy, misanthropy and being sanctimonious based on his writings in Walden, although this criticism has been perceived as highly selective.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Books II and III, however, have not been unearthed, and their contents remain the subject of conjecture Book I offers a summary of the thought of various ancient Greek philosophers. Catherine Osborne identifies Book I as being an important source of information on Pre-Socratic Philosophy. The most extensive treatment is given to the works of Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle. An outline of the philosophies of the Brahmins of India, Zamolxis of Thrace and the Celtic druids and also of the mythological poetry of Hesiod is given here.\nBook IV details and seeks to refute the various beliefs and practices of various diviners and magicians, i.e., the Chaldeans,  the Metoposcopists, the Magicians, and those who practice divination by astronomy. This book closed with a perceived explanation of the connection between the Gnostic heresies of Valentinus and Simon Magus and certain ideas ascribed to Pythagoras, thus linking discussion of Greek philosophy in Book I with later arguments against Gnosticism.\nBook V concerns itself with the Ophite heresies. The auothor in particular identifies the Naassenes, the Peratae, the Sethians, and the beliefs of a heretic, Justinus. The Ophite error is identified as being rooted in the philosophy of the ancients. In Chapter 2 of this book, the author accuses the Naassenes of (a) believing that the pagan god Attis \"has been emasculated, that is, he has passed over from the earthly parts of the nether world to the everlasting substance above, where...there is neither female nor male, but a new creature, a new man, which is hermaphrodite\" [trans. J. H. McMahon]; and (b) of conflating Jesus and Attis based on the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel according to the Egyptians.In Book VI, the attack begun at the end of Book IV against Simon Magus and Valentinus resumes. The author sketches out their ideas, again affirming the source of their error to be the teaching of Pythagoras. The remainder of this book discusses the heresies of Valentinus' supposed followers.\nBook VII challenges the teachings of such heretics as Basilides and his disciple Saturnilus, Marcion of Sinope, and Carpocrates of Alexandria, among others. These heresiarchs all held varying opinions on the God of the Old Testament, from Saturnilus, who are stated as believing that \"the God of the Jews is one of the angels\", directly opposed by Christ, to Carpocrates who asserted that the Father was for the most part aloof from physical creation, which had been formed by his angels.A discussion of the heretical Docetae begins Book VIII. Who exactly the Docetae were is unclear, though the auothor seems to make a distinction between this group and others who considered Jesus to exist merely in appearance, the latter being the doctrine to which the term \"Docetism\" is now affixed. This heresy is associated with a misinterpretation of the Parable of the Sower of Matthew's Gospel and a belief that Christ's soul was separated from his body at his Crucifixion. The author proceeds to explain and argue against the Gnostics Monoimus, Tatian, and Hermogenes, before digressing from the Gnostic theme to refute the practices of the Quartodecimans. He likewise condemns the \"Phrygians\", i.e., the followers of Montanus and the Gnostic heresy of the Encratites.Book IX begins with a refutation of the heresy of Noetus. This particular 'error' is said to implicate the now-canonised popes Zephyrinus and Callixtus I. This theme of conflict with the papacy is expanded upon in the second chapter of Book IX, which deals in particular with the errors of Pope Callixtus, whom is identified as a \"sorcerer\". The author then attacks the Elcesaites, who he says had a different baptismal practice than that of orthodox Christians. Book IX concludes with a summary of the heresy of the Jews, who are divided into Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes.Book X concludes the work with a summary of what has written throughout.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The Magician's Nephew, the penultimate book to be published, but the last to be written, was completed in 1954. Lewis did not write the books in the order in which they were originally published, nor were they published in their current chronological order of presentation. The original illustrator, Pauline Baynes, created pen and ink drawings for the Narnia books that are still used in the editions published today. Lewis was awarded the 1956 Carnegie Medal for The Last Battle, the final book in the saga. The series was first referred to as The Chronicles of Narnia by fellow children's author Roger Lancelyn Green in March 1951, after he had read and discussed with Lewis his recently completed fourth book The Silver Chair, originally entitled Night under Narnia.Lewis described the origin of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in an essay entitled \"It All Began with a Picture\":\n\nThe Lion all began with a picture of a Faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood. This picture had been in my mind since I was about sixteen. Then one day, when I was about forty, I said to myself: \"Let's try to make a story about it.\"\nShortly before the start of World War II, many children were evacuated to the English countryside in anticipation of attacks on London and other major urban areas by Nazi Germany. As a result, on 2 September 1939, three school girls named Margaret, Mary and Katherine came to live at The Kilns in Risinghurst, Lewis's home three miles east of Oxford city centre. Lewis later suggested that the experience gave him a new appreciation of children and in late September he began a children's story on an odd sheet of paper which has survived as part of another manuscript:\n\nThis book is about four children whose names were Ann, Martin, Rose and Peter. But it is most about Peter who was the youngest. They all had to go away from London suddenly because of Air Raids, and because Father, who was in the Army, had gone off to the War and Mother was doing some kind of war work. They were sent to stay with a kind of relation of Mother's who was a very old professor who lived all by himself in the country.\nIn \"It All Began with a Picture\" C. S. Lewis continues:\n\nAt first, I had very little idea how the story would go. But then suddenly Aslan came bounding into it. I think I had been having a good many dreams of lions about that time. Apart from that, I don't know where the Lion came from or why he came. But once he was there, he pulled the whole story together, and soon he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after him.\nAlthough Lewis pleaded ignorance about the source of his inspiration for Aslan, Jared Lobdell, digging into Lewis's history to explore the making of the series, suggests Charles Williams's 1931 novel The Place of the Lion as a likely influence.The manuscript for The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was complete by the end of March 1949.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The manga focuses on a high school student named Akira Fudo who absorbs the powers of the demon called \"Amon\" with help of his friend Ryo Asuka in order to battle creatures hidden in human society, thus calling himself the \"Devilman\" in the process. The series was originally ordered by Toei Animation as a toned-down anime version of Nagai's previous manga series, Demon Lord Dante. However, Nagai wrote a darker-toned manga in order to alert readers of the dangers of the wars based on how dark the narrative becomes with each of Akira's challenges.\nDevilman's 39-episode anime series was developed by Toei Animation in 1972, while Nagai began the Devilman as a manga in Kodansha's Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine, barely a month before the anime series started.

Robots already exist (for example, a Roomba) that are too simple to understand when they are causing pain or injury and know to stop. Many are constructed with physical safeguards such as bumpers, warning beepers, safety cages, or restricted-access zones to prevent accidents. Even the most complex robots currently produced are incapable of understanding and applying the Three Laws; significant advances in artificial intelligence would be needed to do so, and even if AI could reach human-level intelligence, the inherent ethical complexity as well as cultural/contextual dependency of the laws prevent them from being a good candidate to formulate robotics design constraints. However, as the complexity of robots has increased, so has interest in developing guidelines and safeguards for their operation.In a 2007 guest editorial in the journal Science on the topic of \"Robot Ethics\", SF author Robert J. Sawyer argues that since the U.S. military is a major source of funding for robotic research (and already uses armed unmanned aerial vehicles to kill enemies) it is unlikely such laws would be built into their designs. In a separate essay, Sawyer generalizes this argument to cover other industries stating:\n\nThe development of AI is a business, and businesses are notoriously uninterested in fundamental safeguards \u2014 especially philosophic ones. (A few quick examples: the tobacco industry, the automotive industry, the nuclear industry. Not one of these has said from the outset that fundamental safeguards are necessary, every one of them has resisted externally imposed safeguards, and none has accepted an absolute edict against ever causing harm to humans.)\nDavid Langford has suggested a tongue-in-cheek set of laws:\n\nA robot will not harm authorized Government personnel but will terminate intruders with extreme prejudice.\nA robot will obey the orders of authorized personnel except where such orders conflict with the Third Law.\nA robot will guard its own existence with lethal antipersonnel weaponry, because a robot is bloody expensive.Roger Clarke (aka Rodger Clarke) wrote a pair of papers analyzing the complications in implementing these laws in the event that systems were someday capable of employing them. He argued \"Asimov's Laws of Robotics have been a very successful literary device. Perhaps ironically, or perhaps because it was artistically appropriate, the sum of Asimov's stories disprove the contention that he began with: It is not possible to reliably constrain the behaviour of robots by devising and applying a set of rules.\" On the other hand, Asimov's later novels The Robots of Dawn, Robots and Empire and Foundation and Earth imply that the robots inflicted their worst long-term harm by obeying the Three Laws perfectly well, thereby depriving humanity of inventive or risk-taking behaviour.\nIn March 2007 the South Korean government announced that later in the year it would issue a \"Robot Ethics Charter\" setting standards for both users and manufacturers. According to Park Hye-Young of the Ministry of Information and Communication the Charter may reflect Asimov's Three Laws, attempting to set ground rules for the future development of robotics.The futurist Hans Moravec (a prominent figure in the transhumanist movement) proposed that the Laws of Robotics should be adapted to \"corporate intelligences\" \u2014 the corporations driven by AI and robotic manufacturing power which Moravec believes will arise in the near future. In contrast, the David Brin novel Foundation's Triumph (1999) suggests that the Three Laws may decay into obsolescence: Robots use the Zeroth Law to rationalize away the First Law and robots hide themselves from human beings so that the Second Law never comes into play. Brin even portrays R. Daneel Olivaw worrying that, should robots continue to reproduce themselves, the Three Laws would become an evolutionary handicap and natural selection would sweep the Laws away \u2014 Asimov's careful foundation undone by evolutionary computation. Although the robots would not be evolving through design instead of mutation because the robots would have to follow the Three Laws while designing and the prevalence of the laws would be ensured, design flaws or construction errors could functionally take the place of biological mutation.\nIn the July/August 2009 issue of IEEE Intelligent Systems, Robin Murphy (Raytheon Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&M) and David D. Woods (director of the Cognitive Systems Engineering Laboratory at Ohio State) proposed \"The Three Laws of Responsible Robotics\" as a way to stimulate discussion about the role of responsibility and authority when designing not only a single robotic platform but the larger system in which the platform operates. The laws are as follows:\n\nA human may not deploy a robot without the human-robot work system meeting the highest legal and professional standards of safety and ethics.\nA robot must respond to humans as appropriate for their roles.\nA robot must be endowed with sufficient situated autonomy to protect its own existence as long as such protection provides smooth transfer of control which does not conflict with the First and Second Laws.Woods said, \"Our laws are a little more realistic, and therefore a little more boring\u201d and that \"The philosophy has been, \u2018sure, people make mistakes, but robots will be better \u2013 a perfect version of ourselves\u2019. We wanted to write three new laws to get people thinking about the human-robot relationship in more realistic, grounded ways.\"In early 2011, the UK published what is now considered the first national-level AI softlaw, which consisted largely of a revised set of 5 laws, the first 3 of which updated Asimov's. These laws ere published with commentary, by the EPSRC/AHRC working group in 2010:\nRobots are multi-use tools. Robots should not be designed solely or primarily to kill or harm humans, except in the interests of national security.\nHumans, not Robots, are responsible agents. Robots should be designed and operated as far as practicable to comply with existing laws, fundamental rights and freedoms, including privacy.\nRobots are products. They should be designed using processes which assure their safety and security.\nRobots are manufactured artefacts. They should not be designed in a deceptive way to exploit vulnerable users; instead their machine nature should be transparent.\nThe person with legal responsibility for a robot should be attributed.", "hasanswer": false}]}

This attribution rests principally on the evidence of an early-fifteenth-century manuscript of the C-text (see below) of Piers held at Trinity College, Dublin (MS 212), which ascribes the work to one man, called 'Willielmus de Langlond':\n\nMemorandum quod Stacy de Rokayle pater willielmi de Langlond qui stacius fuit generosus & morabatur in Schiptoun vnder whicwode tenens domini le Spenser in comitatu Oxoniensi qui predictus willielmus fecit librum qui vocatur Perys ploughman.\nTranslation:\n\nIt should be noted that Stacy de Rokayle was the father of William de Langlond; this Stacy was born and dwelt in Shipton-under-Wychwood, a tenant of the Lord Spenser in the county of Oxfordshire. The aforesaid William made the book which is called Piers Plowman.\nOther manuscripts also name the author as \"Robert or William Langland\", or \"Wilhelmus W.\" (which could be shorthand for \"William of Wychwood\").\nThe attribution to William Langland is also based on internal evidence, primarily a seemingly autobiographical section in Passus 5 of the C-text of the poem. The main narrator of the poem in all the versions is named Will, with allegorical resonances clearly intended, and Langland (or Longland) is thought to be indicated as a surname through apparent puns; e.g., at one point the narrator remarks: \"I have lyved in londe... my name is longe wille\" (B.XV.152). This could be a coded reference to the poet's name, in the style of much late-medieval literature. New evidence suggests that this reverse cryptogram was read as \"Will Long Will\" by contemporary scribes and that the rebels of 1381 used this name as a pseudonym alongside the name \"Piers Plowman\". Langland's authorship, however, is not entirely beyond dispute, as recent work by Stella Pates and C. David Benson has demonstrated. In their work, \"The Langland Myth\", they claim there is not enough evidence to suggest that Langland is, in fact, the author, but instead that it is the work of a man by the name of William de la Rokele.In the sixteenth century, when Piers was first printed, authorship was attributed by various antiquarians (such as John Bale) and poets to John Wycliffe and Geoffrey Chaucer, amongst others. Some sixteenth- and seventeenth-century persons regarded the poem as anonymous, and/or associated it with texts in the plowman tradition of social complaint, particularly the Chaucerian pseudepigrapha The Ploughman's Tale and Pierce the Ploughman's Crede. (The latter was appended to Owen Rogers' 1560 edition of Piers Plowman, a degraded version of Robert Crowley's 1550 editions.) The character of Piers himself had come to be considered by many readers to be in some sense the author.\nThe first printed editions by Crowley named the author as \"Robert Langland\" in a prefatory note. Langland is described as a probable prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Wycliffe. With Crowley's editions, the poem followed an existing and subsequently repeated convention of titling the poem The Vision of Piers [or Pierce] Plowman, which is in fact the conventional name of just one section of the poem.\nSome medievalists and text critics, beginning with John Matthews Manly, have posited multiple authorship theories for Piers, an idea which continues to have a periodic resurgence in the scholarly literature. One scholar now disputes the single-author hypothesis, supposing that the poem may be the work of between two and five authors, depending upon how authorship is defined. Also, scholars like Charlotte Brewer suggest that scribes and their supervisors be regarded as editors with semi-authorial roles in the production of early modern texts like Piers Ploughman.", "hasanswer": false}]}

When Dorothy's Cairn Terrier Toto bites the wealthy Almira Gulch, Gulch obtains a sheriff's order authorizing her to seize the dog to be destroyed. Toto escapes and returns to Dorothy, who runs away to protect him. Professor Marvel, a charlatan fortune-teller, persuades Dorothy to go home because Aunt Em is heartbroken. She returns just as a tornado approaches the farm. Unable to get into the locked storm shelter, Dorothy takes cover in the farmhouse and is knocked unconscious as the tornado lifts the house and drops it intact onto an unknown land.\nDorothy awakens and is greeted by a good witch named Glinda, who floats down in a pink bubble and explains she is in Munchkinland in the land of Oz, and that the Munchkins are celebrating because the house landed on the Wicked Witch of the East. Her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West, appears in a puff of smoke; before she can seize her deceased sister's ruby slippers, Glinda magically transports them onto Dorothy's feet and tells her to keep them on, as they must be powerful if the Wicked Witch wants them so badly. Because the Wicked Witch has no power in Munchkinland, she leaves in another puff of smoke, but not before telling Dorothy, \"I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog too!\" Glinda recommends Dorothy follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City, the home of the Wizard of Oz, as he might know how to help her return home.\nAlong the way, Dorothy meets the Scarecrow, who wants a brain; the Tin Man, who wants a heart; and the Cowardly Lion, who wants courage. The group reaches the Emerald City, despite the efforts of the Wicked Witch. Dorothy is initially denied an audience with the Wizard by his guard, but the guard relents due to Dorothy's grief, and the four are led into the Wizard's chambers. The Wizard appears as a giant ghostly head and tells them he will grant their wishes if they bring him the Wicked Witch's broomstick.\nDuring their quest, Dorothy and Toto are captured by flying monkeys and taken to the Wicked Witch, but the ruby slippers protect her and Toto manages to escape, leading the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion to the castle. They free Dorothy, but are pursued and finally cornered by the Witch and her guards. The Witch toys with them, setting fire to the Scarecrow. When Dorothy throws a bucket of water onto the Scarecrow, she inadvertently splashes the Witch, causing her to melt away.\nThe Witch's guards gratefully give Dorothy her broomstick, and the four return to the Wizard, but he tells them to return tomorrow. When Toto pulls back a curtain, the \"Wizard\" is revealed to be an ordinary man operating machinery that projects the ghostly image of his face. The four travelers confront the Wizard, who insists that he is a good man at heart, but confesses to being a humbug. He then \"grants\" the wishes of Dorothy's three friends by giving them tokens to confirm that they have the qualities they sought.\nThe Wizard reveals that he, like Dorothy, is from Kansas and accidentally arrived in Oz in a hot air balloon. When he offers to take Dorothy back to Kansas with him aboard his balloon, she accepts, but Toto jumps off and Dorothy goes after him, and the balloon accidentally lifts off with just the Wizard aboard. Glinda reappears and tells Dorothy she always had the power to return to Kansas using the ruby slippers, but had to find that out for herself. After sharing a tearful farewell with her friends, Dorothy heeds Glinda's instructions by tapping her heels three times and repeating the words \"There's no place like home.\" \nDorothy is transported back to Kansas, where she awakens in her own bed. Aunt Em attends to her while Uncle Henry and the farm hands stand by.

The well-known 12th-century poem Hirlas Owain by Owain Cyfeiliog, in which Owain praises his own war-band, likens them to the heroes of the Gododdin and uses Y Gododdin as a model. A slightly later poet, Dafydd Benfras, in a eulogy addressed to Llywelyn the Great, wishes to be inspired \"to sing as Aneirin sang / The day he sang the Gododdin\". After this period this poetry seems to have been forgotten in Wales for centuries until Evan Evans (Ieuan Fardd) discovered the manuscript in the late 18th century. From the early 19th century onwards there are many allusions in Welsh poetry.\nIn English, Y Gododdin was a major influence on the long poem In Parenthesis (1937) by David Jones, in which he reflects on the carnage he witnessed in the First World War. Jones put a quotation from Y Gododdin at the beginning of each of the seven sections of In Parenthesis. Another poet writing in English, Richard Caddel, used Y Gododdin as the basis of his difficult but much-admired poem For the Fallen (1997), written in memory of his son Tom. Tony Conran's poem Elegy for the Welsh Dead, in the Falklands Islands, 1982 opens with the line \"Men went to Catraeth\", using the original poem to comment on a contemporary conflict. The theme and rhythm of Y Gododdin are also the undercurrent for Owen Sheers's Pink Mist (2012), an epic elegy to dead and wounded soldiers who served in Afghanistan; the poem, which drew on 30 interviews with returned servicemen, was originally commissioned for radio and then produced by the Old Vic theatre company as a stage play.The poem has also inspired a number of historical novels, including Men Went to Cattraeth (1969) by John James, The Shining Company (1990) by Rosemary Sutcliff, and The Amber Treasure (2009) by Richard J Denning. In 1989, the British industrial music band Test Dept. brought out an album titled Gododdin, in which the words of the poem were set to music, part in the original and part in English translation. This was a collaboration with the Welsh avant-garde theatre company Brith Gof and was performed in Wales, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Scotland.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "50_318", "question": "Who is the author of The Revenger's Tragedy?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_19645", "text": "The Revenger's Tragedy is influenced by Seneca and Medieval theatre. It is written in 5 acts and opens with a monologue that looks back at previous events and anticipates future events. This monologue is spoken by Vindice, who says he will take revenge and explains the corruption in court. It uses onomastic rhetoric in Act 3, scene 5 where characters play upon their own names, a trait considered to be Senecan. The verbal violence is seen as Senecan, with Vindice in Act 2, scene 1, calling out against heaven, \"Why does not heaven turn black or with a frown/Undo the world?\"\nThe play also adapts Senecan attributes with the character Vindice. At the end of the play he is a satisfied revenger, which is typically Senecan. However, he is punished for his revenge, unlike the characters in Seneca's Medea and Thyestes. In another adaptation of Seneca, there is a strong element of meta-theatricality as the play makes references to itself as a tragedy. For example, in Act 4, scene 2, \"Vindice: Is there no thunder left, or is't kept up /In stock for heavier vengeance [Thunder] There it goes!\"\nAlong with influences from Seneca, this play is said to be very relevant to, or even about, Shakespeare's Hamlet. The differences between the two, however, stem from the topic of \"moral disorientation\" found in The Revenger's Tragedy which is unlike anything found in a Shakespeare play. This idea is discussed in a scholarly article written by Scott McMillin, who addresses Howard Felperin's views of the two plays. McMillin goes on to disagree with the idea of a \"moral disorientation\", and finds The Revenger's Tragedy to be perfectly clear morally. McMillin asserts The Revenger's Tragedy is truly about theater, and self-abandonment within theatrics and the play itself. It is also noted that the most common adverb in The Revenger's Tragedy is the word \"now\" which emphasizes the compression of time and obliteration of the past. In Hamlet time is discussed in wider ranges, which is especially apparent when Hamlet himself thinks of death. This is also very different from Vindice's dialogue, as well as dialogue altogether in The Revenger's Tragedy.The medieval qualities in the play are described by Lawrence J. Ross as, \"the contrasts of eternity and time, the fusion of satirically realistic detail with moral abstraction, the emphatic condemnation of luxury, avarice and superfluity, and the lashing of judges, lawyers, usurers and women.\" To personify Revenge is seen as a Medieval characteristic. Although The Revenger's Tragedy does not personify this trait with a character, it is mentioned in the opening monologue with a capital, thereby giving it more weight than a regular noun.", "hasanswer": false}]}

One day at rehearsal, Madeline confesses to Evangeline that she had a dream in which she placed a hot iron on her mother. Struck by this dream, Evangeline decides to have the performers recreate it in an improv exercise. Madeline gets overwhelmed at how her life is conflating with her art and wanders out of the theater alone while Regina looks for her.

Commenting on the development of the Septimus Heap character, Sage has described him as someone in a strange and hostile world who has no idea of his real identity. The series gained momentum with the development of the character of Marcia Overstrand, which Sage credits as an inspiration. Septimus Heap is centred on the warmth and strength of the Heap family. In an interview Sage said:\n\nI like their chaotic acceptance of life, and the fact that they don't do what they are told by authority if they think it is wrong. Stuff happens to them that makes their life difficult at times but they don't moan about things, they just get on and sort it out as best they can. They are remarkably accepting of other people, I think because they are so strong as a unit. They are also a family which becomes separated by circumstances- and I wanted to show that families can still be close to each other and care for each other even though they live apart. The family relationships develop as the books progress, and are central to the story.\nSage keeps a  boat (called Muriel) in real life, as does the character Sally Mullin in Magyk. Other inspirations for the series included Sage's love of history and the misty landscape of Cornwall, where she lived before starting the series. Another factor in the development of the series was her love of daydreaming: \"Slowly ... lots of thinking, and daydreaming. I am a big fan of daydreaming and staring out of the window. Then keeping all my thoughts and ideas in a dog-eared old envelope for ages.\" With The Wilton Villager, Sage further expanded her inspiration behind the series. \"It was an idea I had had for a very long time, and I waited a long time while it grew and developed. [...] I try and write the books I would have loved to have read as a child and teenager. [...] It all started with the spelling of the first title, 'Magyk.' I felt the way that magic is normally spelled makes people think of conjuring tricks and stage magicians and I wanted to avoid that, but in the past, before spelling became standardized, people would spell words how they chose to, sometimes in different ways in the same sentence.

The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the provisions of the Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act in Late Corporation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. United States in May 1890.In April 1889, Woodruff, the president of the church, began privately refusing the permission that was required to contract new plural marriages. In October 1889, Woodruff publicly admitted that he was no longer approving new polygamous marriages, and in answer to a reporter's question of what the LDS Church's attitude was toward the law against polygamy, Woodruff stated, \"We mean to obey it. We have no thought of evading it or ignoring it.\" Because it had been Mormon practice for over 25 years to either evade or ignore anti-polygamy laws, Woodruff's statement was a signal that a change in church policy was developing.In February 1890, the Supreme Court had already ruled in Davis v. Beason that a law in Idaho Territory which disenfranchised individuals who practiced or believed in plural marriage was constitutional. That decision left the Mormons no further legal recourse to their current marriage practices and made it unlikely that without change Utah Territory would be granted statehood.Woodruff later said that on the night of September 23, 1890, he received a revelation from Jesus Christ that the church should cease the practice of plural marriage.

Munch portrayed Haakon as a mighty, almost flawless ruler, which in turn influenced Henrik Ibsen in his 1863 play The Pretenders. In the early 20th century, poet Hans E. Kinck countered and viewed Haakon as an insignificant king subordinated to forces outside of his control, a view which influenced historians such as Halvdan Koht and Edvard Bull, Sr. Haakon has often been compared with Skule B\u00e5rdsson, and historians have taken sides in the old conflict. While Munch saw Skule as a traitor to the rightful Norwegian king, Koht viewed Skule as a heroic figure. On more sketchy grounds, Kinck praised Skule as representing the original and dying Norse culture, and Haakon as a superficial emulator of foreign culture. Since the 1960s, historians including Narve Bj\u00f8rgo, Per Sveaas Andersen, Knut Helle, Svein Haga, and K\u00e5re Lunden have in turn professed a reaction against Koht's view. According to Sverre Bagge, modern historians tend to follow Koht when it comes to see Skule's rebellion as a last desperate attempt to stop Haakon from encroaching on Skule's power, but lean closer to Munch's overall evaluation of the two men.Knut Helle interprets the saga to leave an impression of Skule as a skilled warrior and politician, while noting that the author of the saga purposely created a diffuse image of his role in the conflict with Haakon. On the other hand, Helle notes that Skule was outmaneuvered with relative ease by Haakon's supporters in the years immediately after 1217, and that this may suggest some limited abilities. While neither giving a clear picture of Haakon, Helle maintains that Haakon \"obviously\" learned to master the political game in his early years. He interprets Haakon as an independent and strong-willed ruler to whom he assigns a \"significant personal responsibility\" for the policies pursued during his reign: notably regarding the internal consolidation of the kingship, the orientation towards European culture and the aggressive foreign policy.

The nature of this nation is intended to be ambiguous. At first glance, Erewhon appears to be a Utopia, yet it soon becomes clear that this is far from the case. Yet for all the failings of Erewhon, it is also clearly not a dystopia, such as that depicted in 1949 in  George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four.\nAs a satirical utopia, Erewhon has sometimes been compared to Gulliver's Travels (1726), a classic novel by Jonathan Swift; the image of Utopia in this latter case also bears strong parallels with the self-view of the British Empire at the time. It can also be compared to the William Morris novel, News from Nowhere (1890).\nErewhon satirises various aspects of Victorian society, including criminal punishment, religion, and anthropocentrism. For example, according to Erewhonian law, offenders are treated as if they were ill, whereas ill people are looked upon as criminals. Another feature of Erewhon is the absence of machines; this is due to the widely shared perception by the Erewhonians that machines are potentially dangerous.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The play, the third work of the Norwegian's career, reflects the birth of Romantic Nationalism in the Norway of that period, and had a strongly anti-Danish sentiment. It centers on the Scandinavia of 1510\u20131540 as the Kalmar Union collapsed, the impacts of the Reformation were becoming evident in Norway, and a last desperate struggle was being mounted to maintain Norwegian independence. Its initial sentiments were so strongly anti-Danish that Ibsen ultimately toned them down.Norwegian literature was virtually nonexistent during the period of the Scandinavian Union and the subsequent Dano-Norwegian union (1387\u20141814) \u2014 Ibsen characterized that period as \"Four Hundred Years of Darkness.\" Ibsen was a major participant in a flood of nationalistic romanticism that followed the \"Four Hundred Years of Darkness\" and is recognized as one of the great four contributors of this period (the others being Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson, Alexander Kielland, and Jonas Lie).  A unity of purpose pervades the whole period, recreation of a national culture based on the almost forgotten past. Subsequent research has shown the play Fru Inger til \u00d8steraad deviates rather liberally from the actual historical events, and should be understood in its context as a statement of nationalism.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Other characters included John Silver, a pirate sea captain; the Herring Brothers, John Silver's three-man crew; and King Bongo, a primitive-living but sophisticated-acting Black jungle monarch who ruled a tropical island.\nAs originally created, Mama's husband was Papa Katzenjammer, her brother was the bungling sailor Heinie, and der Captain\u2013introduced in 1902\u2014was Heinie's boss. After a short while, Papa was dropped from the strip without explanation, with der Captain taking over his function. By the 1940s, der Captain and Mama were often presented as a de facto couple.\nThe immediate Katzenjammer family usually spoke stereotypical German-accented English. When first introduced, der Captain and der Inspector did not, but within months adopted the accent as well. During World Wars I and II, when the United States was at war with Germany, the Katzenjammer family were temporarily presented as Dutch.\nThe defining theme of the strip was Hans and Fritz pranking der Captain, der Inspector, Mama, or all three, for which the boys were often spanked, but sometimes shifted the blame to others. Other stories involved der Captain taking the Katzenjammers on treasure hunts or cargo voyages, sometimes aided by or competing with John Silver. Still other stories involved King Bongo enlisting the Katzenjammers to run errands or go on missions related to his kingdom; in both strips, by the mid-1930s, the family lived on Bongo's island\u2014usually called Squee-Jee\u2014and were readily at hand.\nKnerr's version of The Katzenjammer Kids introduced several major new characters in the 1930s. Miss Twiddle, a pompous tutor, and her brainy niece Lena came to stay permanently with the Katzenjammers in early 1936. Later in the year Twiddle's ex-pupil, \"boy prodigy\" Rollo Rhubarb joined them. The ever-smug Rollo is always trying to outwit Hans and Fritz, but his cunning plans often backfire.\nThe Captain and the Kids also introduced some new characters. Ginga Dun is a snooty Indian trader who can outsmart almost anyone and only talks in verse. Captain Bloodshot is a pint-sized pirate rival of John Silver's.\nNotable features of the later strips, at both syndicates, included a more constructive relationship between the Captain and the boys, who sometimes bickered like friendly rivals rather than pranking each other outright.

Although he long tried to get both countries to adopt a closer political union, the kingdoms of Scotland and England remained individual sovereign states, with their own parliaments, judiciaries, and laws, both ruled by James in personal union. He was the longest-reigning monarch of the Kingdom of Scotland.\nJames was the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, and a great-great-grandson of Henry VII, King of England and Lord of Ireland, and thus a potential successor to all three thrones. He succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months, after his mother was forced to abdicate in his favour. Four different regents governed during his minority, which ended officially in 1578, though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583. In 1589, he married Anne of Denmark. Three of their children survived to adulthood: Henry Frederick, Elizabeth, and Charles. In 1603, James succeeded his cousin Elizabeth I, the last Tudor monarch of England and Ireland, who died childless. He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years, a period known as the Jacobean era, until his death in 1625. After the Union of the Crowns, he based himself in England (the largest of the three realms) from 1603, returning to Scotland only once, in 1617, and styled himself \"King of Great Britain and Ireland\". He was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland. In his reign, the Plantation of Ulster and English colonisation of the Americas began.\nAt 57 years and 246 days, James's reign in Scotland was the longest of any Scottish monarch. He achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England, including the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the English Parliament. Under James, the \"Golden Age\" of Elizabethan literature and drama continued, with writers such as William Shakespeare, John Donne, Ben Jonson, and Francis Bacon contributing to a flourishing literary culture. James himself was a prolific writer, authoring works such as Daemonologie (1597), The True Law of Free Monarchies (1598), and Basilikon Doron (1599). He sponsored the translation of the Bible into English later named after him, the Authorized King James Version, and the 1604 revision of the Book of Common Prayer. Anthony Weldon claimed that James had been termed \"the wisest fool in Christendom\", an epithet associated with his character ever since. Since the latter half of the 20th century, historians have tended to revise James's reputation and treat him as a serious and thoughtful monarch. He was strongly committed to a peace policy, and tried to avoid involvement in religious wars, especially the Thirty Years' War that devastated much of Central Europe. He tried but failed to prevent the rise of hawkish elements in the English Parliament who wanted war with Spain. He was succeeded by his second son, Charles I.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "50_342", "question": "Who is the author of \"In Death Ground\"?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_18861", "text": "The story is a philosophical-satirical pseudo-review by Victor Pelevin. It is a parody of religious studies, a satire on religious-philosophical movements and sects, a \"canonization\" of \"ideologies, works, and great men.According to the author's thought, the word \"mardong\" is Tibetan and denotes a whole set of concepts. Originally, it was the name of a cult object, which was obtained this way: If a person in life was distinguished by holiness, purity or, on the contrary, represented, figuratively speaking, \"the flower of evil\", then after death, which, incidentally, Tibetans always considered one of the stages of personal development, the body of such a person was not buried in the ground, but made of it \"mardong\" \u2013 a place of power and religious worship. A sect is forming around the so-called \"mardongs\" in Russia in the early 1990s.The essence of the story is a pure reflection of the sect's views, its theoretical works and its main figure \u2013 Antonov, after whom it was named, the attributes of the members of this movement, etc.A peculiar cult of death is created in the sect; all life, called in the sect \"primordial mortality,\" is seen as preparation for death . Spiritual practices are developed in the sect, in particular the chanting of the mantra \"Pushkin is great\". The image of the poet plays a major role in the sect of the Antonovs. Another practice is the study of ancient Russian culture. Thus, matryoshka becomes supposedly a system of embedded dead people.After Antonov's \"self-realization\" (in ordinary parlance, death), his \"mardong,\" that is, a specially treated corpse turned into a statue, becomes a place of pilgrimage for the sectarians.In the story, through the theory of a certain philosopher Antonov about the lifetime nurturing of the inner dead by each of the living people continues to embody and realize Pelevin's idea of eternity and the single essence of the human spirit and flesh, the living and the dead in the universe. According to Pelevin's Antonov, from the moment of birth every living person begins to nurture death, a corpse, because continuation of life leads to inevitable approach to death.Life and death in Pelevin's philosophy turn out to be communicating vessels, those two entities that are inseparable from each other. According to Pelevin (or according to the conviction of his hero), the entire spiritual life [of man] must be oriented toward his \"mardong,\" the dead man that we carry within us, for he becomes the transitional state of man from one being to another.For all the ironic stance of the author, the underlying meaning of Pelevin's story turns out to be far from humorous. The popular phrase about the duality of light and darkness, right and left, life and death finds its philosophical realization in the author's text, which makes us think about the justice of his character's dialectical judgment.And in this sense, Pelevin's creation of the word-neologism \"mardongi\" is almost on a par with the notion of Buddhist nirvana. It is as if the writer creates his own version of \"Russian Buddhism\", trying oriental truths on to the national mentality. That is, time, space, memory, sleep, life, death become in Pelevin the categories of one series, one philosophical system.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "50_344", "question": "Who is the author of Journey Through the Impossible?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_19750", "text": "Since 1863, Verne had been under contract with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel, who published each of his novels, beginning with Five Weeks in a Balloon (1863) and Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864) and continuing through the rest of his books to form the novel sequence Hetzel called the Voyages Extraordinaires. The arrangement gave Verne prominence as a novelist and a certain amount of financial stability, but under the terms of the contract Verne's profits barely earned him a living wage. Verne's fortunes changed markedly in 1874, when the stage adaptation of his novel Around the World in Eighty Days was a smash hit, running for 415 performances in its original production and quickly making Verne wealthy as well as famous as a playwright. Adapted with the collaboration of the showman d'Ennery, the play invented and codified the pi\u00e8ce de grand spectacle, an extravagant theatrical genre that became intensely popular in Paris throughout the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Verne and d'Ennery went on to adapt two other Verne novels, The Children of Captain Grant and Michael Strogoff, as similarly spectacular plays.Verne began playing with the idea of bringing a mixed selection of Voyages Extraordinaires characters together on a new adventure in early 1875, when he considered writing a novel in which Samuel Fergusson from Five Weeks in a Balloon, Pierre Aronnax from Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, Phileas Fogg from Around the World in Eighty Days, Dr. Clawbonny from The Adventures of Captain Hatteras, and other characters would go around the world together in a heavier-than-air flying machine. Another novel featuring a similar trip around the world in a flying machine, Alphonse Brown's La Conqu\u00eate de l'air, was published later that year, causing Verne to put the idea on hold. The idea, in highly modified form, finally reemerged five years later as Journey Through the Impossible.Verne went to d'Ennery with the idea in February 1880, and they collaborated in Antibes for several weeks on two projects simultaneously: the dramatization of Michael Strogoff and the new play. Journey Through the Impossible was the only one of their collaborations not based directly on a pre-existing Verne novel. Modern scholarship has not been successful in determining how much of the play each of the collaborators wrote, but the Verne scholar Robert Pourvoyeur has suggested that the play is clearly founded on Verne's ideas and therefore can be treated as being mostly the work of Verne.According to contemporary rumors, Verne and d'Ennery came to difficulties over the treatment of science in the play, with d'Ennery wanting to condemn scientific research and Verne advocating a more science-friendly and hopeful approach.

In other words, the idea is that individuals' most basic needs must be met before they become motivated to achieve higher-level needs. Despite the fact that the ideas behind the hierarchy are Maslow's, the pyramid itself does not exist anywhere in Maslow's original work.The most fundamental four layers of the pyramid contain what Maslow called \"deficiency needs\" or \"d-needs\": esteem, friendship and love, security, and physical needs. If these \"deficiency needs\" are not met \u2013 except for the most fundamental (physiological) need \u2013 there may not be a physical indication, but the individual will feel anxious and tense.  Deprivation is what causes deficiency, so when one has unmet needs, this motivates them to fulfill what they are being denied. Maslow's idea suggests that the most basic level of needs must be met before the individual will strongly desire (or focus motivation upon) the secondary or higher-level needs. Maslow also coined the term \"metamotivation\" to describe the motivation of people who go beyond the scope of basic needs and strive for constant betterment.The human brain is a complex system and has parallel processes running at the same time, thus many different motivations from various levels of Maslow's hierarchy can occur at the same time. Maslow spoke clearly about these levels and their satisfaction in terms such as \"relative\", \"general\", and \"primarily\". Instead of stating that the individual focuses on a certain need at any given time, Maslow stated that a certain need \"dominates\" the human organism. Thus Maslow acknowledged the likelihood that the different levels of motivation could occur at any time in the human mind, but he focused on identifying the basic types of motivation and the order in which they would tend to be met.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Muslims avidly recited it, alone and in groups, in homes and mosques, utterly spending themselves in the Blessings on the Most Beloved and praising him\".The Dala'il al-Khayrat is the first major book in Islamic history which compiled litanies of peace and blessings upon Muhammad. It is also the most popular and most universally acclaimed collection of litanies asking God to bless him. Among some Sunni religious orders, most notably the Shadhili order, its recitation is a daily practice. In others however, its recitation is a purely voluntary daily practice. The work begins with the ninety nine names of God, and then a collection of 201 names of Muhammad.The legend behind the origin of the Dala'il al-Khayrat claims that al-Jazuli once awoke late for his morning prayers and began to look in vain for pure water to perform ritual ablutions. In the midst of his search al-Jazuli encountered a young girl who was aware of al-Jazuli's famed religiosity and was bewildered on why al-Jazuli could not find pure water. The girl then spat into a well which miraculously overflowed with pure sweet water for al-Jazuli to perform ablutions. Consequent to performing prayer, al-Jazuli inquired to the means by which the girl achieved such a high spiritual station. The girl replied it was simply by \"Making constant prayer for God to bless the best of creation by the number of breaths and heartbeats.\" Al-Jazuli then resolved to write a work collecting litanies of prayers asking God to bless and show mercy and kindness to Muhammad.\nAl-Jazuli then moved east to Medina where he would recite the whole of the Dala'il al-Khayrat twice daily at Muhammad's grave in al-Masjid an-Nabawi. The Dala'il Khayrat has since been seen as a testament of love and passionate longing for Muhammad.\nMany of exegesis were written on the Dala'il Khayrat - most notably by the scholar Yusuf an-Nabhani in his work Afdal al-Salawat, Mohammed al-Mahdi al-Fasi's Matali\u2018 Al Masarrat Bi Jalaa\u2019 Dala\u2019il Al Khayrat (\u0645\u0637\u0627\u0644\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0628\u062c\u0644\u0627\u0621 \u062f\u0644\u0627\u0626\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u064a\u0631\u0627\u062a) and Abd al-Majid al-Sharnubi al-Azhari's Sharh Dala'il Khayrat.

Other writers, such as Agnes Smedley, had written in some detail about the Chinese Communists before the Long March, but none of these writers had ever visited them or even conducted first hand interviews with them.

As a young man, he discovered the magazine Amazing Stories, established in 1926 by Hugo Gernsback, after answering an ad for one free issue. He strove to write his own fiction and sold his first story to Gernsback at age 20: \"The Metal Man\" was published in the December 1928 issue of Amazing. During the next year Gernsback published three more of his stories in the new pulp magazines Science Wonder Stories and Air Wonder Stories, and separately published \"The Girl from Mars\" by Miles J. Breuer and Williamson as Science Fiction Series #1. His work during this early period was heavily influenced by A. Merritt, author of The Metal Monster (1920) and other fantasy serials. Noting the Merritt influence, Algis Budrys described \"The Metal Man\" as \"a story full of memorable images\".Early on, Williamson became impressed by the works of Miles J. Breuer and struck up a correspondence with him. A doctor who wrote science fiction in his spare time, Breuer had a strong talent and turned Williamson away from dreamlike fantasies towards more rigorous plotting and stronger narrative. Under Breuer's tutelage, Williamson would send outlines and drafts for review. Their first work together was the novel Birth of a New Republic in which Moon colonies were undergoing something like the American Revolution\u2014a theme later taken up by many other SF writers, particularly in Robert A. Heinlein's The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress.\nWracked by emotional storms and believing many of his physical ailments to be psychosomatic, Williamson underwent psychiatric evaluation in 1933 at the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kansas, in which he began to learn to resolve the conflict between his reason and his emotion. From this period, his stories take on a grittier, more realistic tone.\nBy the 1930s he was an established genre author, and the teenaged Isaac Asimov was thrilled to receive a postcard from Williamson, whom he had idolized, which congratulated him on his first published story and offered \"welcome to the ranks\". Williamson remained a regular contributor to the pulp magazines but did not achieve financial success as a writer until many years later.\nAn unfavorable review of one of his books, which compared his writing to that of a comic strip, brought Williamson to the attention of The New York Sunday News, which needed a science fiction writer for a new comic strip. Williamson wrote the strip Beyond Mars (1952\u201355), loosely based on his novel Seetee Ship, until the paper dropped all comics.\nBeginning 1954 and continuing into the 1990s, Williamson and Frederik Pohl wrote more than a dozen science fiction novels together, including the series Jim Eden, Starchild, and Cuckoo.\nWilliamson continued to write as a nonagenarian and won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards during the last decade of his life, by far the oldest writer to win those awards.In his later years, he would also criticize attempts to write \"serious\" science fiction:\nMaybe because of my own background of writing commercial SF for so many years, I have a great deal of respect for good craftsmanship of the sort that commercial writers must develop. The labels you hear so much of\u2014\"commercial,\" \"serious writer,\" \"mainstream,\" \"hack,\" \"New Wave,\" \"experimental\"\u2014are usually very misleading.\nIn my own field, Ed Hamilton and Hank Kuttner and more recently Bob Silverberg are all writers who formed a fine command of the SF genre early in their careers and who later on used this to do work that is more consciously \"literary\" and hence more admired by critics. But certainly the writing they did earlier was deservedly popular among SF fandom, who evidently found these works \"serious\" enough to merit reading.\n\nI am opposed, however, to literary tricks that tend towards obscurity or artificial difficulty, though I can see arguments for that kind of approach. My own experience as a teacher of writing confirms my sense that new authors with artistic ambitions may find themselves scorning too many of the old forms and patterns simply because they blindly associate them with hack work. The point is that these patterns and structures form the basic vocabulary through which all SF writers must speak. That's one reason I'm not completely sympathetic with contemporary writers like Silverberg and Chip Delany and Tom Disch, who are clearly aiming to get themselves recognized as \"serious\" or mainstream authors.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Some of these were unauthorized reprints of Noah Webster's work; some were revisions of his work. One such revision was Webster's Imperial Dictionary, based on John Ogilvie's The Imperial Dictionary of the English Language, itself an expansion of Noah Webster's American Dictionary.\nFollowing legal action by Merriam, successive US courts ruled by 1908 that Webster's entered the public domain when the Unabridged did, in 1889. In 1917, a US court ruled that Webster's entered the public domain in 1834 when Noah Webster's 1806 dictionary's copyright lapsed. Thus, Webster's became a genericized trademark and others were free to use the name on their own works.\nSince then, use of the name Webster has been rampant. Merriam-Webster goes to great pains to remind dictionary buyers that it alone is the heir to Noah Webster. Although Merriam-Webster revisers find solid ground in Noah Webster's concept of the English language as an ever-changing tapestry, the issue is more complicated than that. Throughout the 20th century, some non-Merriam editions, such as Webster's New Universal, were closer to Webster's work than contemporary Merriam-Webster editions. Further revisions by Merriam-Webster came to have little in common with their original source, while the Universal, for example, was minimally revised and remained largely out of date.\nSo many dictionaries of varied size and quality have been called Webster's that the name no longer has any specific brand meaning. Despite this, many people still recognize and trust the name. Thus, Webster's continues as a powerful and lucrative marketing tool. In recent years, even established dictionaries with no direct link to Noah Webster whatsoever have adopted his name, adding to the confusion. Random House dictionaries are now called Random House Webster's, and Microsoft's Encarta World English Dictionary is now Encarta Webster's Dictionary. The dictionary now called Webster's New Universal no longer even uses the text of the original Webster's New Universal dictionary, but rather is a newly commissioned version of the Random House Dictionary.\nThe Webster's Online Dictionary: The Rosetta Edition is not linked to Merriam-Webster Online.

To demonstrate that they now trust each other, they join together to abuse and frustrate her next potential lover, the Duke, by making him think that the noise coming from beneath the stairs is the devil coming to claim his soul.  It is actually a drunken Cacafogo making the noise.\nMeanwhile, in the other part of the story, Margarita's servant, Estifania, weds Perez, the captain.

In another context, it refers to a spondee in Sanskrit prosody. In the Mahabharata and the Puranas, it is the name of a warrior character. Called Vasusena as a child by his foster parents, he became known by the name Karna because of the golden earrings of Surya he used to wear, according to the Sanskrit epics scholar David Slavitt.The word Karna, states the Indologist Kevin McGrath, signifies \"eared, or the ear-ringed one\". In section 3.290.5 of the Mahabharata, Karna is described as a baby born with the ear-rings and armoured breastplate, like his father Surya.\nThe second meaning of Karna as \"rudder and helm\" is also an apt metaphor given Karna's role in steering the war in Book 8 of the epic, where the good Karna confronts the good Arjuna, one of the climax scenes wherein the Mahabharata authors repeatedly deploy the allegories of ocean and boat to embed layers of meanings in the poem. For example, his first entry into the Kurukshetra battlefield is presented as the Makara movement (an arrangement of soldiers in the sea-monster pattern). As Duryodhana's army crumbles each day, the sea and vessel metaphor repeatedly appears in the epic, particularly when Karna is mentioned. As a newborn, Karna's life begins in a basket without a rudder on a river, in circumstances that he neither chose nor had a say. In Book 1, again in the context of Karna, Duryodhana remarks, \"the origins of heroes and rivers are indeed difficult to understand\".The name Karna is also symbolically connected to the central aspect of Karna's character as the one who is intensely preoccupied with what others hear and think about him, about his fame, a weakness that others exploit to manipulate him. This \"hearing\" and \"that which is heard\", states McGrath makes \"Karna\" an apt name and subtle reminder of Karna's driving motivation.", "hasanswer": false}]}

According to Southern, \"The real Zenobia is elusive, perhaps ultimately unattainable, and novelists, playwrights and historians alike can absorb the available evidence, but still need to indulge in varied degrees of speculation.\"She has been the subject of romantic and ideologically-driven biographies by ancient and modern writers. The Augustan History is the clearest example of an ideological account of Zenobia's life, and its author acknowledged that it was written to criticize the emperor Gallienus. According to the Augustan History, Gallienus was weak because he allowed a woman to rule part of the empire and Zenobia was a more able sovereign than the emperor. The narrative changed as the Augustan History moved on to the life of Claudius Gothicus, a lauded and victorious emperor, with the author characterizing Zenobia's protection of the eastern frontier as a wise delegation of power by Claudius. When the Augustan History reached the biography of Aurelian, the author's view of Zenobia changed dramatically; the queen is depicted as a guilty, insolent, proud coward; her wisdom was discredited and her actions deemed the result of manipulation by advisers.Zenobia's \"staunch\" beauty was emphasized by the author of the Augustan History, who ascribed to her feminine timidity and inconsistency (the reasons for her alleged betrayal of her advisers to save herself). The queen's sex posed a dilemma for the Augustan History since it cast a shadow on Aurelian's victory. Its author ascribed many masculine traits to Zenobia to make Aurelian a conquering hero who suppressed a dangerous Amazon queen. According to the Augustan History, Zenobia had a clear, manly voice, dressed as an emperor (rather than an empress), rode horseback, was attended by eunuchs instead of ladies-in-waiting, marched with her army, drank with her generals, was careful with money (contrary to the stereotypical spending habits of her sex) and pursued masculine hobbies such as hunting. Giovanni Boccaccio wrote a fanciful 14th-century account of the queen in which she is a tomboy in childhood who preferred wrestling with boys, wandering in the forests and killing goats to playing like a young girl. Zenobia's chastity was a theme of these romanticized accounts; according to the Augustan History, she disdained sexual intercourse and allowed Odaenathus into her bed only for conception. Her reputed chastity impressed some male historians; Edward Gibbon wrote that Zenobia surpassed Cleopatra in chastity and valor. According to Boccaccio, Zenobia safeguarded her virginity when she wrestled with boys as a child.Seventeenth-century visitors to Palmyra rekindled the Western world's romantic interest in Zenobia. This interest peaked during the mid-nineteenth century, when Lady Hester Stanhope visited Palmyra and wrote that its people treated her like the queen; she was reportedly greeted with singing and dancing, and Bedouin warriors stood on the city's columns. A procession ended with a mock coronation of Stanhope under the arch of Palmyra as \"queen of the desert\". William Ware, fascinated by Zenobia, wrote a fanciful account of her life. Twentieth-century novelists and playwrights, such as Haley Elizabeth Garwood and Nick Dear, also wrote about the queen.", "hasanswer": false}]}

His intentions in compiling the book are described as \"literary, ethical, and spiritual,\" and he does not provide isnads, that is, chains of transmission for his texts. In view of its sometimes sensitive content, the attribution of this book to Ali or al-Radi has long been a subject of polemic debates, as with the majority of the works about Shia theology.The authenticity of Nahj al-balagha was first challenged over two centuries after al-Radi, perhaps indicating that his sources were well known during his lifetime but were lost gradually. Indeed, it was the Sunni historian Ibn Khallikan (d.\u20091282) who first suggested that the book was authored, rather than compiled, by al-Radi or by his brother Sharif al-Murtada (d.\u20091044), another prominent Shia theologian. Yet elsewhere Ibn Khallikan cited the book without hesitation. The Sunni theologians Ibn Taymiyyah (d.\u20091328) and al-Dhahabi (d.\u20091348) have similarly rejected most of Nahj al-balagha, and this has been the prevalent Sunni view to date. Among Western scholars, this view was shared by Carl Brockelmann (d.\u20091956) and Baron de Slane (d.\u20091878), who apparently mistook the word 'Murtada' on the manuscript as the name of its author and thus attributed the book to Sharif al-Murtada, probably unaware that Murtada is a well-known epithet of Ali. The Mu'tazilite Ibn Abil-Hadid was nevertheless confident that Nahj al-balagha is the work of Ali, but suspected that its controversial Shaqshaqiya sermon was authored by al-Radi. Alternatively, the Sunni historian Khatib al-Baghdadi (d.\u20091071) rejected only the eschatological sermons found in the book.

Some scholars, particularly archaeologists, historians and folklorists have rejected the work \u2013 which T. S.

Similarities between Northup's book and Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel Uncle Tom's Cabin have been noted by critics. Stowe's book was published a year before Northup's memoir but by the time she published her rebuttal to critics about accuracy in her A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin, she referred to his story, which had been publicized in newspaper accounts. Stowe wrote,\n\nIt is a singular coincidence that this man was carried to a plantation in the Red River country, that same region where the scene of Tom's captivity was laid; and his account of this plantation, his mode of life there, and some incidents which he describes, form a striking parallel to that history.\nNorthup's account confirms Stowe's fictional portrayal of conditions in Louisiana, as the area where Northup was enslaved was close to the fictional setting of Simon Legree's plantation on the Red River. Northup expresses other arguments against slavery. For instance, Uncle Tom's Cabin focuses on how the legal system prevents even kind owners from treating slaves well and how it releases cruel owners from liabilities for their treatment of slaves.Such themes appear in Northup's narrative, too. Writing about this work, Eric Herschtal noted that \"Slave narratives were never intended to give an unbiased view. They were antislavery polemics meant to bring down the institution.\" The fact that these works had a purpose was similar to other published works.Herschtal emphasizes that Northup expressed compassion in his account, quoting him: \"It is not the fault of the slaveholder that he is cruel,\" Northup writes, \"so much as it is the fault of the system under which he lives.\"\nNorthup's first-person account of his twelve years of bondage captured attention in the national political debate over slavery that took place in the years leading up to the Civil War. It drew endorsements from major Northern newspapers, anti-slavery organizations, and evangelical groups. It \"sold three times as many copies as Frederick Douglass's slave narrative in its first two years.\"Northup's account describes the daily life of slaves at Bayou Boeuf in Louisiana, their diet and living conditions, the relationship between master and slave, and the means that slave catchers used to recapture runaways. His account shares some details similar to those of authors who were escaped slaves, such as Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, and William Wells Brown. However, Northup was unique in documenting his being kidnapped as a free man from the North and sold into slavery. His perspective was always to compare what he saw to what he knew before while living as a free man in a free state. While there were hundreds of such kidnappings, he was among the few persons who gained freedom again.Early and mid-twentieth century historians of slavery, Kenneth Stampp, Stanley Elkins, and Ulrich Bonnell Phillips, endorsed the historical accuracy of the book.  Eakin and Logsdon in 1968, wrote: \"In the last analysis, [the] narrative deserves to be believed, not simply because [Northup] seems to be talking reasonably, not merely because he adorns his tale with compelling and persuasive details.  At every point where materials exist for checking his account, it can be verified.\"  These materials include trial records, correspondence, diary, and slave sale records.While Twelve Years a Slave is the best-known example of someone who was kidnapped and later freed \u2013 albeit through extraordinary efforts \u2013 historians have begun to research and present other cases. Most of the known court cases of freedom suits related to kidnapping victims were filed in New Orleans, although some were in border states such as Missouri. One such suit took place in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, where Cornelius Sinclair, a free black man from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, had been sold after being kidnapped in August 1825 and transported South with some younger free blacks. A total of about 20 young blacks disappeared from the Philadelphia area that summer, some survivors sold into slavery in Mississippi. Helped by the intervention of Philadelphia mayor Joseph Watson, most of those kidnapped were returned free to Philadelphia by June 1826, but Sinclair's odyssey was longer. He was freed in 1827 by a unanimous verdict of an all-white jury.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It has been suggested that if the author had indeed arranged the Lais as presented in Harley 978, she may have chosen this overall structure to contrast the positive and negative actions that can result from love. In this manuscript, the odd lais (\"Guigemar\", \"Le Fresne\", etc.) praise the characters who express love for other people. By comparison, the even lais, such as \"Equitan\", \"Bisclavret\" and so on, warn how love that is limited to oneself can lead to misfortune.The Harley 978 manuscript also includes a 56-line prologue in which Marie describes the impetus for her composition of the lais. In the prologue, Marie writes that she was inspired by the example of the ancient Greeks and Romans to create something that would be both entertaining and morally instructive.

Its predecessor, the Articles of Confederation, stated that the union of the United States \"shall be perpetual.\" The question of whether or not individual states held the unilateral right to secession was a passionately debated feature of the nations' political discourse from early in its history and remained a difficult and divisive topic until the American Civil War. In 1860 and 1861, 11 southern states each declared secession from the United States and joined to form the Confederate States of America (CSA). Following the defeat of Confederate forces by Union armies in 1865, those states were brought back into the Union during the ensuing Reconstruction era. The federal government never recognized the sovereignty of the CSA, nor the validity of the ordinances of secession adopted by the seceding states.Following the war, the United States Supreme Court, in Texas v. White (1869), held that states did not have the right to secede and that any act of secession was legally void. Drawing on the \"perpetual\" union language of the Articles of Confederation, and its succeeding Preamble to the Constitution, which states that the Constitution intends to \"form a more perfect union\", and speaks of the people of the United States a single body politic who are the authors of the more perfect union (\"We the people\"), the Supreme Court found that states did not have a right to secede.

In \"The Cask of Amontillado\", the victim wears motley; in \"Hop-Frog\", the murderer also dons such attire. However, while \"The Cask of Amontillado\" is told from the murderer's point of view, \"Hop-Frog\" is told from an unidentified third-person narrator's point of view.\nThe grating of Hop-Frog's teeth, right after Hop-Frog witnesses the king splash wine in Trippetta's face, and again just before Hop-Frog sets the eight men on fire, may well be symbolic. Poe often used teeth as a sign of mortality, as with the lips writhing about the teeth of the mesmerized man in \"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar\" or the obsession with teeth in \"Berenice\".\"The Cask of Amontillado\" represents Poe's attempt at literary revenge on a personal enemy, and \"Hop-Frog\" may have had a similar motivation. As Poe had been pursuing relationships with Sarah Helen Whitman and Nancy Richmond (whether romantic or platonic is uncertain), members of literary circles in New York City spread gossip and incited scandal about alleged improprieties. At the center of this gossip was a woman named Elizabeth F. Ellet, whose affections Poe had previously scorned. Ellet may be represented by the king himself, with his seven councilors representing Margaret Fuller, Hiram Fuller (no relation), Thomas Dunn English, Anne Lynch Botta, Anna Blackwell, Ermina Jane Locke, and Locke's husband.The tale is arguably autobiographical in other ways. The jester Hop-Frog, like Poe, is \"kidnapped from home and presented to the king\" (his wealthy foster father John Allan), \"bearing a name not given in baptism but 'conferred upon him'\" and is susceptible to wine ... when insulted and forced to drink becomes insane with rage\". Like Hop-Frog, Poe was bothered by those who urged him to drink, despite a single glass of wine making him drunk.Poe could have based the story on the Bal des Ardents at the court of Charles VI of France in January 1393. At the suggestion of a Norman squire, the king and five others dressed as Wild Men in highly flammable costumes made with pitch and flax. When a candle was mistakenly brought into the tent where the performance was occurring, the fire quickly spread to the performers within the close quarters, four of whom would die from the wounds, the King only being saved by the quick thinking of his aunt Joan, Duchess of Berry who protected him from the flames beneath the folds of her great skirt.

As with some of his other works, he wrote it in collaboration with ghostwriter Auguste Maquet. It is in the swashbuckler genre, which has heroic, chivalrous swordsmen who fight for justice.\nSet between 1625 and 1628, it recounts the adventures of a young man named d'Artagnan (a character based on Charles de Batz-Castelmore d'Artagnan) after he leaves home to travel to Paris, hoping to join the Musketeers of the Guard.

Another, the Dickens Pickwick Club, was founded in 1976 by Cedric Dickens, the author's great-grandson.

The earliest version appeared in 1516, although the poem was not published in its complete form until 1532. Orlando furioso is a continuation of Matteo Maria Boiardo's unfinished romance Orlando innamorato (Orlando in Love, published posthumously in 1495). In its historical setting and characters, it shares some features with the Old French Chanson de Roland of the eleventh century, which tells of the death of Roland. The story is also a chivalric romance which stemmed from a tradition beginning in the late Middle Ages and continuing in popularity in the 16th century and well into the 17th.\nOrlando is the Christian knight known in French (and subsequently English) as Roland. The story takes place against the background of the war between Charlemagne's Christian paladins and the Saracen army that has invaded Europe and is attempting to overthrow the Christian empire. The poem is about war and love and the romantic ideal of chivalry. It mixes realism and fantasy, humor and tragedy. The stage is the entire world, plus a trip to the Moon. The large cast of characters features Christians and Saracens, soldiers and sorcerers, and fantastic creatures including a gigantic sea monster called the Orc and a flying horse called the hippogriff. Many themes are interwoven in its complicated episodic structure, but the most important are the paladin Orlando's unrequited love for the pagan princess Angelica, which drives him mad; the love between the female Christian warrior Bradamante and the Saracen Ruggiero, who are supposed to be the ancestors of Ariosto's patrons, the House of Este of Ferrara; and the war between Christian and Infidel.The poem is divided into forty-six cantos, each containing a variable number of eight-line stanzas in ottava rima (a rhyme scheme of abababcc). Ottava rima had been used in previous Italian romantic epics, including Luigi Pulci's Morgante and Boiardo's Orlando Innamorato.

The series follows the adventures of a village of Gauls as they resist Roman occupation in 50 BC. They do so using a magic potion, brewed by their druid Getafix (Panoramix in the French version), which temporarily gives the recipient superhuman strength. The protagonists, the title character Asterix and his friend Obelix, have various adventures. The \"-ix\" ending of both names (as well as all the other pseudo-Gaulish \"-ix\" names in the series) alludes to the \"-rix\" suffix (meaning \"king\", like \"-rex\" in Latin) present in the names of many real Gaulish chieftains such as Vercingetorix, Orgetorix, and Dumnorix.\nIn some of the stories they travel to foreign countries, whilst other tales are set in and around their village. For much of the history of the series (volumes 4 through 29), settings in Gaul and abroad alternate, with even-numbered volumes set abroad and odd-numbered volumes set in Gaul, mostly in the village.\nThe Asterix series is one of the most popular Franco-Belgian comics in the world, with the series being translated into 111 languages and dialects as of 2009.The success of the series has led to the adaptation of its books into 15 films: ten animated, and five live action (two of which, Asterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatra and Asterix and Obelix vs. Caesar, were major box office successes in France). There have also been a number of games based on the characters, and a theme park near Paris, Parc Ast\u00e9rix.

Most stories are set in a forest in India; one place mentioned repeatedly is \"Seeonee\" (Seoni), in the central\nstate of Madhya Pradesh.\nA major theme in the book is abandonment followed by fostering, as in the life of Mowgli, echoing Kipling's own childhood. The theme is echoed in the triumph of protagonists including Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and The White Seal over their enemies, as well as Mowgli's. Another important theme is of law and freedom; the stories are not about animal behaviour, still less about the Darwinian struggle for survival, but about human archetypes in animal form. They teach respect for authority, obedience, and knowing one's place in society with \"the law of the jungle\", but the stories also illustrate the freedom to move between different worlds, such as when Mowgli moves between the jungle and the village. Critics have also noted the essential wildness and lawless energies in the stories, reflecting the irresponsible side of human nature.\nThe Jungle Book has remained popular, partly through its many adaptations for film and other media.

The Faerie Queene is notable for its form: at over 36,000 lines and over 4,000 stanzas, it is one of the longest poems in the English language; it is also the work in which Spenser invented the verse form known as the Spenserian stanza. On a literal level, the poem follows several knights as a means to examine different virtues, and though the text is primarily an allegorical  work, it can be read on several levels of allegory, including as praise (or, later, criticism) of Queen Elizabeth I. In Spenser's \"Letter of the Authors\", he states that the entire epic poem is \"cloudily enwrapped in Allegorical devices\", and that the aim of publishing The Faerie Queene was to \"fashion a gentleman or noble person in virtuous and gentle discipline\".Spenser presented the first three books of The Faerie Queene to Elizabeth I in 1589, probably sponsored by Walter Raleigh.

{"id": "50_416", "question": "Who is the author of Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\"?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_20097", "text": "The novel that made its author \"the true lion of the Russian literature\" (according to Ivan Goncharov) enjoyed great success with the reading public upon its publication and spawned dozens of reviews and analytical essays, some of which (by Dmitry Pisarev, Pavel Annenkov, Dragomirov and Strakhov) formed the basis for the research of later Tolstoy scholars. Yet the Russian press's initial response to the novel was muted, with most critics unable to decide how to classify it. The liberal newspaper Golos (The Voice, April 3, #93, 1865) was one of the first to react. Its anonymous reviewer posed a question later repeated by many others: \"What could this possibly be? What kind of genre are we supposed to file it to?.. Where is fiction in it, and where is real history?\"Writer and critic Nikolai Akhsharumov, writing in Vsemirny Trud (#6, 1867) suggested that War and Peace was \"neither a chronicle, nor a historical novel\", but a genre merger, this ambiguity never undermining its immense value. Annenkov, who praised the novel too, was equally vague when trying to classify it. \"The cultural history of one large section of our society, the political and social panorama of it in the beginning of the current century,\" was his suggestion. \"It is the [social] epic, the history novel and the vast picture of the whole nation's life,\" wrote Ivan Turgenev in his bid to define War and Peace in the foreword for his French translation of \"The Two Hussars\" (published in Paris by Le Temps in 1875).\nIn general, the literary left received the novel coldly. They saw it as devoid of social critique, and keen on the idea of national unity. They saw its major fault as the \"author's inability to portray a new kind of revolutionary intelligentsia in his novel\", as critic Varfolomey Zaytsev put it. Articles by D. Minayev, Vasily Bervi-Flerovsky and N. Shelgunov in Delo magazine characterized the novel as \"lacking realism\", showing its characters as \"cruel and rough\", \"mentally stoned\", \"morally depraved\" and promoting \"the philosophy of stagnation\". Still, Mikhail Saltykov-Schedrin, who never expressed his opinion of the novel publicly, in private conversation was reported to have expressed delight with \"how strongly this Count has stung our higher society\". Dmitry Pisarev in his unfinished article \"Russian Gentry of Old\" (Staroye barstvo, Otechestvennye Zapiski, #2, 1868), while praising Tolstoy's realism in portraying members of high society, was still unhappy with the way the author, as he saw it, 'idealized' the old nobility, expressing \"unconscious and quite natural tenderness towards\" the Russian dvoryanstvo. On the opposite front, the conservative press and \"patriotic\" authors (A. S. Norov and P. A. Vyazemsky among them) were accusing Tolstoy of consciously distorting 1812 history, desecrating the \"patriotic feelings of our fathers\" and ridiculing dvoryanstvo.One of the first comprehensive articles on the novel was that of Pavel Annenkov, published in #2, 1868 issue of Vestnik Evropy. The critic praised Tolstoy's masterful portrayal of man at war, marveled at the complexity of the whole composition, organically merging historical facts and fiction. \"The dazzling side of the novel,\" according to Annenkov, was \"the natural simplicity with which [the author] transports the worldly affairs and big social events down to the level of a character who witnesses them.\" Annekov thought the historical gallery of the novel was incomplete with the two \"great raznotchintsys\", Speransky and Arakcheyev, and deplored the fact that the author stopped at introducing to the novel \"this relatively rough but original element.\" In the end the critic called the novel \"the whole epoch in the Russian fiction.\"Slavophiles declared Tolstoy their \"bogatyr\" and pronounced War and Peace \"the Bible of the new national idea\". Several articles on War and Peace were published in 1869\u201370 in Zarya magazine by Nikolay Strakhov. \"War and Peace is the work of genius, equal to everything that the Russian literature has produced before\", he pronounced in the first, smaller essay. \"It is now quite clear that from 1868 when the War and Peace was published the very essence of what we call Russian literature has become quite different, acquired the new form and meaning\", the critic continued later. Strakhov was the first critic in Russia who declared Tolstoy's novel to be a masterpiece of a level previously unknown in Russian literature. Still, being a true Slavophile, he could not fail to see the novel as promoting the major Slavophiliac ideas of \"meek Russian character's supremacy over the rapacious European kind\" (using Apollon Grigoryev's formula). Years later, in 1878, discussing Strakhov's own book The World as a Whole, Tolstoy criticized both Grigoriev's concept (of \"Russian meekness vs. Western bestiality\") and Strakhov's interpretation of it.\nAmong the reviewers were military men and authors specializing in war literature. Most assessed highly the artfulness and realism of Tolstoy's battle scenes. N. Lachinov, a member of the Russky Invalid newspaper staff (#69, April 10, 1868) called the Battle of Sch\u00f6ngrabern scenes \"bearing the highest degree of historical and artistic truthfulness\" and totally agreed with the author's view on the Battle of Borodino, which some of his opponents disputed. The army general and respected military writer Mikhail Dragomirov, in an article published in Oruzheiny Sbornik (The Military Almanac, 1868\u201370), while disputing some of Tolstoy's ideas concerning the \"spontaneity\" of wars and the role of commander in battles, advised all the Russian Army officers to use War and Peace as their desk book, describing its battle scenes as \"incomparable\" and \"serving for an ideal manual to every textbook on theories of military art.\"Unlike professional literary critics, most prominent Russian writers of the time supported the novel wholeheartedly. Goncharov, Turgenev, Leskov, Dostoevsky and Fet have all gone on record as declaring War and Peace the masterpiece of Russian literature. Ivan Goncharov in a July 17, 1878, letter to Pyotr Ganzen advised him to choose for translating into Danish War and Peace, adding: \"This is positively what might be called a Russian Iliad. Embracing the whole epoch, it is the grandiose literary event, showcasing the gallery of great men painted by a lively brush of the great master ... This is one of the most, if not the most profound literary work ever\". In 1879, unhappy with Ganzen having chosen Anna Karenina to start with, Goncharov insisted: \"War and Peace is the extraordinary poem of a novel, both in content and execution. It also serves as a monument to Russian history's glorious epoch when whatever figure you take is a colossus, a statue in bronze. Even [the novel's] minor characters carry all the characteristic features of the Russian people and its life.\" In 1885, expressing satisfaction with the fact that Tolstoy's works had by then been translated into Danish, Goncharov again stressed the immense importance of War and Peace. \"Count Tolstoy really mounts over everybody else here [in Russia]\", he remarked.Fyodor Dostoevsky (in a May 30, 1871, letter to Strakhov) described War and Peace as \"the last word of the landlord's literature and the brilliant one at that.\" In a draft version of The Raw Youth he described Tolstoy as \"a historiograph of the dvoryanstvo, or rather, its cultural elite.\" \"The objectivity and realism impart wonderful charm to all scenes, and alongside people of talent, honour and duty he exposes numerous scoundrels, worthless goons and fools,\" he added. In 1876 Dostoevsky wrote: \"My strong conviction is that a writer of fiction has to have most profound knowledge\u2014not only of the poetic side of his art, but also the reality he deals with, in its historical as well as contemporary context. Here [in Russia], as far as I see it, only one writer excels in this, Count Lev Tolstoy.\"Nikolai Leskov, then an anonymous reviewer in Birzhevy Vestnik (The Stock Exchange Herald), wrote several articles praising highly War and Peace, calling it \"the best ever Russian historical novel\" and \"the pride of the contemporary literature\". Marveling at the realism and factual truthfulness of Tolstoy's book, Leskov thought the author deserved the special credit for \"having lifted up the people's spirit upon the high pedestal it deserved\". \"While working most elaborately upon individual characters, the author, apparently, has been studying most diligently the character of the nation as a whole; the life of people whose moral strength came to be concentrated in the Army that came up to fight mighty Napoleon. In this respect the novel of Count Tolstoy could be seen as an epic of the Great national war which up until now has had its historians but never had its singers\", Leskov wrote.Afanasy Fet, in a January 1, 1870, letter to Tolstoy, expressed his great delight with the novel. \"You've managed to show us in great detail the other, mundane side of life and explain how organically does it feed the outer, heroic side of it\", he added.Ivan Turgenev gradually re-considered his initial skepticism as to the novel's historical aspect and also the style of Tolstoy's psychological analysis. In his 1880 article written in the form of a letter addressed to Edmond Abou, the editor of the French newspaper Le XIXe Si\u00e8cle, Turgenev described Tolstoy as \"the most popular Russian writer\" and War and Peace as \"one of the most remarkable books of our age.\" \"This vast work has the spirit of an epic, where the life of Russia of the beginning of our century in general and in details has been recreated by the hand of a true master ... The manner in which Count Tolstoy conducts his treatise is innovative and original. This is the great work of a great writer, and in it there\u2019s true, real Russia,\" Turgenev wrote. It was largely due to Turgenev's efforts that the novel started to gain popularity with the European readership. The first French edition of the War and Peace (1879) paved the way for the worldwide success of Leo Tolstoy and his works.Since then many world-famous authors have praised War and Peace as a masterpiece of world literature. Gustave Flaubert expressed his delight in a January 1880 letter to Turgenev, writing: \"This is the first class work! What an artist and what a psychologist! The first two volumes are exquisite.

Creon, the new ruler of Thebes and brother of the former Queen Jocasta, has decided that Eteocles will be honored and Polynices will be in public shame. The rebel brother's body will not be sanctified by holy rites and will lie unburied on the battlefield, prey for carrion animals, the harshest punishment at the time. Antigone and Ismene are the sisters of the dead Polynices and Eteocles.\n\nIn the opening of the play, Antigone brings Ismene outside the palace gates late at night for a secret meeting: Antigone wants to bury Polynices' body, in defiance of Creon's edict. Ismene refuses to help her, not believing that it will actually be possible to bury their brother, who is under guard, but she is unable to stop Antigone from going to bury her brother herself.\n\nThe Chorus, consisting of Theban elders, enter and cast the background story of the Seven against Thebes into a mythic and heroic context.Creon enters and seeks the support of the Chorus in the days to come and, in particular, wants them to back his edict regarding the disposal of Polynices' body. The leader of the Chorus pledges his support out of deference to Creon. A sentry enters, fearfully reporting that the body has been given funeral rites and a symbolic burial with a thin covering of earth, though no one saw who actually committed the crime. Creon, furious, orders the sentry to find the culprit or face death himself. The sentry leaves.\n\nThe Chorus sings of the ingenuity of human beings; but add that they do not wish to live in the same city as law-breakers.The sentry returns, bringing Antigone with him. The sentry explains that the watchmen uncovered Polynices' body and then caught Antigone as she did the funeral rituals. Creon questions her after sending the sentry away, and she does not deny what she has done. She argues unflinchingly with Creon about the immorality of the edict and the morality of her actions. Creon becomes furious, and seeing Ismene upset, thinks she must have known of Antigone's plan. He summons her. Ismene tries to confess falsely to the crime, wishing to die alongside her sister, but Antigone will not have it. Creon orders that the two women be imprisoned.\n\nThe Chorus sings of the troubles of the house of Oedipus.Haemon, Creon's son, enters to pledge allegiance to his father, even though he is engaged to Antigone. He initially seems willing to forsake Antigone, but when he gently tries to persuade his father to spare Antigone, claiming that \"under cover of darkness the city mourns for the girl\", the discussion deteriorates, and the two men are soon bitterly insulting each other. When Creon threatens to execute Antigone in front of his son, Haemon leaves, vowing never to see Creon again.\n\nThe Chorus sings of the power of love.Antigone is brought in under guard on her way to execution.  She sings a lament.  The Chorus compares her to the goddess Niobe, who was turned into a rock, and say it is a wonderful thing to be compared to a goddess.  Antigone accuses them of mocking her.\nCreon decides to spare Ismene and to bury Antigone alive in a cave. By not killing her directly, he hopes to pay minimal respects to the gods. She is brought out of the house, and this time, she is sorrowful instead of defiant. She expresses her regrets at not having married and dying for following the laws of the gods. She is taken away to her living tomb.\n\nThe Chorus encourages Antigone by singing of the great women of myth who suffered.Tiresias, the blind prophet, enters. Tiresias warns Creon that Polynices should now be urgently buried because the gods are displeased, refusing to accept any sacrifices or prayers from Thebes. However, Creon accuses Tiresias of being corrupt. Tiresias responds that Creon will lose \"a son of [his] own loins\" for the crimes of leaving Polynices unburied and putting Antigone into the earth (he does not say that Antigone should not be condemned to death, only that it is improper to keep a living body underneath the earth). Tiresias also prophesies that all of Greece will despise Creon and that the sacrificial offerings of Thebes will not be accepted by the gods. The leader of the Chorus, terrified, asks Creon to take Tiresias' advice to free Antigone and bury Polynices. Creon assents, leaving with a retinue of men.\n\nThe Chorus delivers a choral ode to the god Dionysus.A messenger enters to tell the leader of the Chorus that Haemon has killed himself. Eurydice, Creon's wife and Haemon's mother, enters and asks the messenger to tell her everything. The messenger reports that Creon saw to the burial of Polynices. When Creon arrived at Antigone's cave, he found Haemon lamenting over Antigone, who had hanged herself. Haemon unsuccessfully attempted to stab Creon, then stabbed himself. Having listened to the messenger's account, Eurydice silently disappears into the palace.\nCreon enters, carrying Haemon's body. He understands that his own actions have caused these events and blames himself. A second messenger arrives to tell Creon and the Chorus that Eurydice has also killed herself. With her last breath, she cursed her husband for the deaths of her sons, Haemon and Megareus. Creon blames himself for everything that has happened, and, a broken man, he asks his servants to help him inside. The order he valued so much has been protected, and he is still the king, but he has acted against the gods and lost his children and his wife as a result. After Creon condemns himself, the leader of the Chorus closes by saying that although the gods punish the proud, punishment brings wisdom.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Helen Burns's death from tuberculosis (referred to as consumption) recalls the deaths of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's sisters, Elizabeth and Maria, who died of the disease in childhood as a result of the conditions at their school, the Clergy Daughters School at Cowan Bridge, near Tunstall, Lancashire. Mr Brocklehurst is based on Rev. William Carus Wilson (1791\u20131859), the Evangelical minister who ran the school. Additionally, John Reed's decline into alcoholism and dissolution recalls the life of Charlotte's brother Branwell, who became an opium and alcohol addict in the years preceding his death. Finally, like Jane, Charlotte became a governess. These facts were revealed to the public in The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb (1857) by Charlotte's friend and fellow novelist Elizabeth Gaskell.The Gothic manor of Thornfield Hall was probably inspired by North Lees Hall, near Hathersage in the Peak District in Derbyshire. This was visited by Charlotte Bront\u00eb and her friend Ellen Nussey in the summer of 1845, and is described by the latter in a letter dated 22 July 1845. It was the residence of the Eyre family, and its first owner, Agnes Ashurst, was reputedly confined as a lunatic in a padded second floor room. It has been suggested that the Wycoller Hall in Lancashire, close to Haworth, provided the setting for Ferndean Manor to which Mr Rochester retreats after the fire at Thornfield: there are similarities between the owner of Ferndean\u2014Mr Rochester's father\u2014and Henry Cunliffe, who inherited Wycoller in the 1770s and lived there until his death in 1818; one of Cunliffe's relatives was named Elizabeth Eyre (n\u00e9e Cunliffe).

Set in the Jazz Age on Long Island, near New York City, the novel depicts first-person narrator Nick Carraway's interactions with mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and Gatsby's obsession to reunite with his former lover, Daisy Buchanan.\nThe novel was inspired by a youthful romance Fitzgerald had with socialite Ginevra King, and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island's North Shore in 1922. Following a move to the French Riviera, Fitzgerald completed a rough draft of the novel in 1924. He submitted it to editor Maxwell Perkins, who persuaded Fitzgerald to revise the work over the following winter. After making revisions, Fitzgerald was satisfied with the text, but remained ambivalent about the book's title and considered several alternatives. Painter Francis Cugat's dust jacket art, named Celestial Eyes, greatly impressed Fitzgerald, and he incorporated its imagery into the novel.\nAfter its publication by Scribner's in April 1925, The Great Gatsby received generally favorable reviews, though some literary critics believed it did not equal Fitzgerald's previous efforts. Compared to his earlier novels, This Side of Paradise (1920) and The Beautiful and Damned (1922), the novel was a commercial disappointment. It sold fewer than 20,000 copies by October, and Fitzgerald's hopes of a monetary windfall from the novel were unrealized. When the author died in 1940, he believed himself to be a failure and his work forgotten.\nDuring World War II, the novel experienced an abrupt surge in popularity when the Council on Books in Wartime distributed free copies to American soldiers serving overseas.

The first installment, Dead Until Dark (2001), won the Anthony Award for Best Paperback Mystery in 2001 and later served as the source material for the HBO drama series True Blood (2008\u20132014). The book series has been retronymed the True Blood Series upon reprinting, to capitalize on the television adaptation.\nIn The Southern Vampire Mysteries/True Blood Series, Harris develops a detailed mythology and an alternative history scenario in which supernatural beings actually exist. Not only vampires but also werwolves and fairies exist in this scenario, and a growing public awareness of their presence is part of the plot development. The setting is contemporary, and the stories occasionally reference popular culture.\nThe series is narrated in first person perspective by Sookie Stackhouse, a waitress and a telepath in the fictional town of Bon Temps in northwestern Louisiana. Harris was originally contracted to write 10 books, but she revealed at Comic Con 2009 that she had signed a contract for three additional books. On May 14, 2012, Harris' Facebook administrator confirmed that the 13th book, Dead Ever After, would be the final book of the series.", "hasanswer": true}]}

{"id": "50_435", "question": "Who is the author of \"Around the World in Eighty Days\"?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_20197", "text": "The idea of a trip around the world within a set period had clear external origins. It was popular before Verne published his book in 1873. Even the title Around the World in Eighty Days is not original. Several sources have been hypothesized as the origins of the story.Another early reference comes from the Italian traveler Giovanni Francesco Gemelli Careri. He wrote a book in 1699 that was translated into French: Voyage around the World or Voyage du Tour du Monde (1719, Paris).Around the World by Steam, via Pacific Railway, was published in 1871 by the Union Pacific Railroad Company, and an Around the World in A Hundred and Twenty Days by Edmond Planchut. In early 1870, the Erie Railway Company published a statement of routes, times, and distances detailing a trip around the globe of 38,204 km (23,739 mi) in 77 days and 21 hours.American William Perry Fogg traveled the world, describing his tour in a series of letters to The Cleveland Leader newspaper, entitled, Round the World: Letters from Japan, China, India, and Egypt (1872).In 1872, Thomas Cook organised the first around-the-world tourist trip, leaving on 20 September 1872 and returning seven months later. The journey was described in a series of letters published in 1873 as Letter from the Sea and from Foreign Lands, Descriptive of a tour Round the World. Scholars have pointed out similarities between Verne's account and Cook's letters. However, some argue that Cook's trip happened too late to influence Verne. According to a second-hand 1898 account, Verne refers to a Cook advertisement as a source for the idea of his book. In interviews in 1894 and 1904, Verne says the source was \"through reading one day in a Paris cafe\" and \"due merely to a tourist advertisement seen by chance in the columns of a newspaper.\" Around the World itself says the origins were a newspaper article. All of these point to Cook's advert as being a probable spark for the idea of the book.The periodical Le Tour du monde (3 October 1869) contained a short piece titled \"Around the World in Eighty Days\", which refers to 230 km (140 mi) of the railway not yet completed between Allahabad and Bombay, a central point in Verne's work. But even the Le Tour de monde article was not entirely original; it cites in its bibliography the Nouvelles Annales des Voyages, de la G\u00e9ographie, de l'Histoire et de l'Arch\u00e9ologie (August 1869), which also contains the title Around the World in Eighty Days in its contents page. The Nouvelles Annales were written by Conrad Malte-Brun (1775\u20131826) and his son Victor Adolphe Malte-Brun (1816\u20131889). Scholars believe that Verne was aware of the Le Tour de monde article, the Nouvelles Annales, or both and that he consulted it or them, noting that the Le Tour du monde even included a trip schedule very similar to Verne's final version.A possible inspiration was the traveller George Francis Train, who made four trips around the world, including one in 80 days in 1870. Similarities include the hiring of a private train and being imprisoned. Train later claimed, \"Verne stole my thunder. I'm Phileas Fogg.\"\nRegarding the idea of gaining a day, Verne said of its origin: \"I have a great number of scientific odds and ends in my head. It was thus that, when, one day in a Paris caf\u00e9, I read in the Si\u00e8cle that a man could travel around the world in 80 days, it immediately struck me that I could profit by a difference of meridian and make my traveller gain or lose a day in his journey. There was a d\u00e9nouement ready found. The story was not written until long after. I carry ideas about in my head for years \u2013 ten, or 15 years, sometimes \u2013 before giving them form.\" In his April 1873 lecture, \"The Meridians and the Calendar\", Verne responded to a question about where the change of day occurred since the international date line only became current in 1880 and the Greenwich prime meridian was not adopted internationally until 1884. Verne cited an 1872 article in Nature, and Edgar Allan Poe's short story \"Three Sundays in a Week\" (1841), which was also based on going around the world and the difference in a day linked to a marriage at the end. Verne even analysed Poe's story in his Edgar Poe and His Works (1864).", "hasanswer": false}]}

Accordingly, the Institutes were made the textbook at the law school in Rome, and later in Ravenna when the school relocated there. However, after the loss of most of these areas, only the Catepanate (southern Italy) maintained a Byzantine legal tradition, but there the Corpus was superseded by the Ecloga and Basilika. Only the Corpus's provisions regulating the church still had any effect, but the Catholic church's de facto autonomy and the Great Schism made even that irrelevant. In Western Europe, the Corpus may have spurred a slew of Romano-Germanic law codes in the successor Germanic kingdoms, but these were heavily based on the older Theodosian Code, not the Corpus.\nHistorians disagree on the precise way the Corpus was recovered in Northern Italy about 1070: legal studies were undertaken on behalf of papal authority central to the Gregorian Reform of Pope Gregory VII, which may have led to its accidental rediscovery. Aside from the Littera Florentina (a complete 6th-century copy of the Digest preserved in Amalfi and later moved to Pisa) and the Epitome Codicis (c. 1050; incomplete manuscript preserving most of the Codex), there may have been other manuscript sources for the text that began to be taught at Bologna, by Pepo and then by Irnerius. Irnerius' technique was to read a passage aloud, which permitted his students to copy it, then to deliver an excursus explaining and illuminating Justinian's text, in the form of glosses. Irnerius' pupils, the so-called Four Doctors of Bologna, were among the first of the \"glossators\" who established the curriculum of medieval Roman law. The tradition was carried on by French lawyers, known as the Ultramontani, in the 13th century.The merchant classes of Italian communes required law with a concept of equity, and law that covered situations inherent in urban life better than the primitive Germanic oral traditions. The provenance of the Code appealed to scholars who saw in the Holy Roman Empire a revival of venerable precedents from the classical heritage. The new class of lawyers staffed the bureaucracies that were beginning to be required by the princes of Europe. The University of Bologna, where Justinian's Code was first taught, remained the dominant centre for the study of law through the High Middle Ages.A two-volume edition of the Digest was published in Paris in 1549 and 1550, translated by Antonio Agust\u00edn, Bishop of Tarragona, who was well known for other legal works. The full title of the Digest was Digestorum Seu Pandectarum tomus alter, and it was published by \"Apud Carolam Guillards\". Vol. 1 of the Digest has 2934 pages, while Vol. 2 has 2754 pages. Referring to Justinian's Code as Corpus Juris Civilis was only adopted in the 16th century, when it was printed in 1583 by Dionysius Gothofredus under this title. The legal thinking behind the Corpus Juris Civilis served as the backbone of the single largest legal reform of the modern age, the Napoleonic Code, which marked the abolition of feudalism, but reinstated slavery in the French Caribbean. Napoleon, as he waged total war on Europe, wanted to see these principles introduced to the whole of Europe because he saw them as an effective form of rule that created a more equal society and thus creating a more friendly relationship between the ruling class and the rest of the peoples of Europe.The Corpus Juris Civilis was translated into French, German, Italian, and Spanish in the 19th century. However, no English translation of the entire Corpus Juris Civilis existed until 1932 when Samuel Parsons Scott published his version The Civil Law. Scott did not base his translation on the best available Latin versions, and his work was severely criticized.Fred. H. Blume used the best-regarded Latin editions for his translations of the Code and of the Novels. A new English translation of the Code, based on Blume's, was published in October 2016. In 2018, the Cambridge University Press also published a new English translation of the Novels, based primarily on the Greek text.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It incorporates concepts from the original 1974 D&D boxed set plus the Supplement I: Greyhawk. The rulebook covers characters of levels one through three, rules for adventuring in dungeons, and introduces the concepts of the game; it explains the game's concepts and method of play in terms that make them accessible to new players ages twelve and above who might not be familiar with tabletop miniatures wargaming. Although the Basic Set was not fully compatible with Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, players were expected to continue play beyond third level by moving to AD&D, which was released beginning later that year. Holmes preferred a lighter tone with more room for personal improvisation, while Gary Gygax, who wrote the Advanced books, wanted an expansive game with rulings on any conceivable situation which might come up during play, and so could be used to arbitrate disputes at tournaments.The first Basic Set was available as a 48-page standalone rulebook featuring artwork by David C. Sutherland III, or as part of a boxed set, which was packaged in a larger, more visually appealing box than the original boxed set, allowing the game to be stocked on retail shelves and targeted at the general public via toy stores. The boxed set included a set of polyhedral dice and supplemental materials. In that same year, Games Workshop (U.K.) published their own version of the rulebook, with a cover by John Blanche, and illustrations by Fangorn. Supplemental materials appearing in the boxed set included geomorphs, monster and treasure lists, and a set of polyhedral dice.For a period in 1979, TSR experienced a dice shortage. Basic sets published during this time frame came with two sheets of numbered cutout cardstock chits that functioned in lieu of dice, along with a coupon for ordering dice from TSR. The rulebook also included a brief sample dungeon with a full-page map. Starting with the fourth printing in 1978, the two booklets of maps, encounter tables, and treasure lists were replaced with the module B1 In Search of the Unknown; printings six through eleven (1979\u20131982) featured the module B2 The Keep on the Borderlands instead.Jon Peterson, for Polygon, highlighted that Dave Arneson sued TSR over Basic Set royalties in 1977 \u2013 Arneson was only being paid royalties for the Basic D&D rulebook included in the boxed set and was not paid for the \"cover price of the whole Basic Set\". Peterson wrote \"as Arneson's lawsuit loomed, TSR made a very pointed substitution to the contents of the Basic Set: they rotated out the Dungeon Geomorphs and Monster & Treasure Assortment booklets, replacing them with Mike Carr's In Search of the Unknown module. [...] It was a good idea to target a module at beginning dungeon masters \u2014 but it also had clear implications for the legal situation. Previously, when Arneson sought a 5% royalty on the whole contents of the Basic Set, he was effectively asking for money that was going into Gygax's pocket. Now, he would instead be asking for money earmarked for his friend Mike Carr\". Carr received royalties for In Search of the Unknown when the module was sold alone and when it was included in the Basic Set. After the September 1979 disappearance of James Dallas Egbert III, Dungeons & Dragons received \"mainstream notoriety. And with that, sales of the Basic Set rose dramatically. Right before the steam tunnel incident, the Basic Set might have sold 5,000 copies a month. By the end of 1979, it was trading over 30,000 copies per month, and only going up from there\". Following Carr's financial success due to his module being included in the boxed set, Gygax changed the module included with the Basic Set to Keep on the Borderlands which was a module he wrote.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Voltaire was generally critical of Tacitus and said that Tacitus did not comply with the standards for providing a historical background to civilization. In 1878, John Wilson Ross and, in 1890, Polydore Hochart suggested that the whole of the Annals had been forged by the Italian scholar Poggio Bracciolini (1380\u20131459). According to Robert Van Voorst this was an \"extreme hypothesis\" which never gained a following among modern scholars.The provenance of the manuscripts containing the Annals goes back to the Renaissance. While Bracciolini had discovered three minor works at Hersfeld Abbey in Germany in 1425, Zanobi da Strada (who died in 1361) had probably earlier discovered Annals 11\u201316 at Monte Cassino where he lived for some time. The copies of Annals at Monte Cassino were probably moved to Florence by Giovanni Boccaccio (1313\u20131375), a friend of da Strada, who is also credited with their discovery at Monte Cassino. Regardless of whether the Monte Cassino manuscripts were moved to Florence by Boccaccio or da Strada, Boccaccio made use of the Annals when he wrote Commento di Dante c. 1374 (before the birth of Poggio Bracciolini), giving an account of Seneca's death directly based on the Tacitean account in Annals book 15. Francis Newton states that it is likely that Annals 11\u201316 were in Monte Cassino during the first half of the rule of Abbot Desiderius (1058\u20131087) who later became Pope Victor III. Annals 1\u20136 were then independently discovered at Corvey Abbey in Germany in 1508 by Giovanni Angelo Arcimboldi, afterwards Archbishop of Milan, and were first published in Rome in 1515 by Beroaldus, by order of Pope Leo X, who afterwards deposited the manuscript in the Medicean Library in Florence.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Schoolcraft seems to have been inconsistent in his pursuit of authenticity, as he rewrote and censored sources. The folklorist Stith Thompson, although crediting Schoolcraft's research with being a \"landmark,\" was quite critical of him: \"Unfortunately, the scientific value of his work is marred by the manner in which he has reshaped the stories to fit his own literary taste.\" In addition to Longfellow\u2019s own annotations, Stellanova Osborn (and previously F. Broilo in German) tracked down \"chapter and verse\" for every detail Longfellow took from Schoolcraft. Others have identified words from native languages included in the poem.\nIntentionally epic in scope, The Song of Hiawatha was described by its author as \"this Indian Edda\". But Thompson judged that despite Longfellow's claimed \"chapter and verse\" citations, the work \"produce[s] a unity the original will not warrant,\" i.e., it is non-Indian in its totality. Thompson found close parallels in plot between the poem and its sources, with the major exception that Longfellow took legends told about multiple characters and substituted the character Hiawatha as the protagonist of them all. Resemblances between the original stories, as \"reshaped by Schoolcraft,\" and the episodes in the poem are but superficial, and Longfellow omits important details essential to Ojibwe narrative construction, characterization, and theme. This is the case even with \"Hiawatha\u2019s Fishing,\" the episode closest to its source. Some important parts of the poem were more or less Longfellow's invention from fragments or his imagination. \"The courtship of Hiawatha and Minnehaha, the least 'Indian' of any of the events in Hiawatha, has come for many readers to stand as the typical American Indian tale.\" Also, \"in exercising the function of selecting incidents to make an artistic production, Longfellow ... omitted all that aspect of the Manabozho saga which considers the culture hero as a trickster,\" this despite the fact that Schoolcraft had already diligently avoided what he himself called \"vulgarisms.\"In his book on the development of the image of the Indian in American thought and literature, Pearce wrote about The Song of Hiawatha:\n\nIt was Longfellow who fully realized for mid-nineteenth century Americans the possibility of [the] image of the noble savage.  He had available to him not only [previous examples of] poems on the Indian ... but also the general feeling that the Indian belonged nowhere in American life but in dim prehistory. He saw how the mass of Indian legends which Schoolcraft was collecting depicted noble savages out of time, and offered, if treated right, a kind of primitive example of that very progress which had done them in.  Thus in Hiawatha he was able, matching legend with a sentimental view of a past far enough away in time to be safe and near enough in space to be appealing, fully to image the Indian as noble savage.  For by the time Longfellow wrote Hiawatha, the Indian as a direct opponent of civilization was dead, yet was still heavy on American consciences ... The tone of the legend and ballad ... would color the noble savage so as to make him blend in with a dim and satisfying past about which readers could have dim and satisfying feelings.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The French philosopher Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe called Heart of Darkness \"one of the greatest texts of Western literature\" and used Conrad's tale for a reflection on \"The Horror of the West\".\nHeart of Darkness is criticised in postcolonial studies, particularly by Nigerian novelist Chinua Achebe. In his 1975 public lecture \"An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's Heart of Darkness\", Achebe described Conrad's novella as \"an offensive and deplorable book\" that de-humanised Africans. Achebe argued that Conrad, \"blinkered ... with xenophobia\", incorrectly depicted Africa as the antithesis of Europe and civilisation, ignoring the artistic accomplishments of the Fang people who lived in the Congo River basin at the time of the book's publication. He argued that the book promoted and continues to promote a prejudiced image of Africa that \"depersonalises a portion of the human race\" and concluded that it should not be considered a great work of art.Achebe's critics argue that he fails to distinguish Marlow's view from Conrad's, which results in very clumsy interpretations of the novella. In their view, Conrad portrays Africans sympathetically and their plight tragically, and refers sarcastically to, and condemns outright, the supposedly noble aims of European colonists, thereby demonstrating his skepticism about the moral superiority of European men. Ending a passage that describes the condition of chained, emaciated slaves, Marlow remarks: \"After all, I also was a part of the great cause of these high and just proceedings.\" Some observers assert that Conrad, whose native country had been conquered by imperial powers, empathised by default with other subjugated peoples. Jeffrey Meyers notes that Conrad, like his acquaintance Roger Casement, \"was one of the first men to question the Western notion of progress, a dominant idea in Europe from the Renaissance to the Great War, to attack the hypocritical justification of colonialism and to reveal... the savage degradation of the white man in Africa.\":\u200a100\u201301\u200a Likewise, E.D. Morel, who led international opposition to King Leopold II's rule in the Congo, saw Conrad's Heart of Darkness as a condemnation of colonial brutality and referred to the novella as \"the most powerful thing written on the subject.\"\nConrad scholar Peter Firchow writes that \"nowhere in the novel does Conrad or any of his narrators, personified or otherwise, claim superiority on the part of Europeans on the grounds of alleged genetic or biological difference\". If Conrad or his novel is racist, it is only in a weak sense, since Heart of Darkness acknowledges racial distinctions \"but does not suggest an essential superiority\" of any group. Achebe's reading of Heart of Darkness can be (and has been) challenged by a reading of Conrad's other African story, \"An Outpost of Progress\", which has an omniscient narrator, rather than the embodied narrator, Marlow. Masood Ashraf Raja has suggested that Conrad's positive representation of Muslims in his Malay novels complicates these charges of racism.In 2003, Motswana scholar Peter Mwikisa concluded the book was \"the great lost opportunity to depict dialogue between Africa and Europe\". Zimbabwean scholar Rino Zhuwarara, however, broadly agreed with Achebe, though considered it important to be \"sensitised to how peoples of other nations perceive Africa\". The novelist Caryl Phillips stated in 2003 that: \"Achebe is right; to the African reader the price of Conrad's eloquent denunciation of colonisation is the recycling of racist notions of the 'dark' continent and her people. Those of us who are not from Africa may be prepared to pay this price, but this price is far too high for Achebe\".In his 1983 criticism, the British academic Cedric Watts criticizes the insinuation in Achebe's critique\u2014the premise that only black people may accurately analyse and assess the novella, as well as mentioning that Achebe's critique falls into self-contradictory arguments regarding Conrad's writing style, both praising and denouncing it at times.   Stan Galloway writes, in a comparison of Heart of Darkness with  Jungle Tales of Tarzan, \"The inhabitants [of both works], whether antagonists or compatriots, were clearly imaginary and meant to represent a particular fictive cipher and not a particular African people\". More recent critics like Nidesh Lawtoo have stressed that the \"continuities\" between Conrad and Achebe are profound and that a form of \"postcolonial mimesis\" ties the two authors via productive mirroring inversions.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Facsimiles of the originals can be found in the online Biodiversity Heritage Library (Vol.1) and Vol 2).\nThe author was the French botanist Jacques Labillardi\u00e8re, who visited the region in 1792 with the d'Entrecasteaux expedition. Published between 1804 and 1806, it is one of the earliest works to describe the plants of the continent; according to Denis and Maisie Carr, \"[i]n practical terms, this was the first general flora of Australia.\"The work describes the botanical collections made by himself and his companion on the d'Entrecasteaux expedition, Charles Riche, and the unattributed and later collections of Nicolas Baudin's expedition. Labillardi\u00e8re's collections were seized by the English, but were returned to him in France at the intervention of Joseph Banks. He made his collections at Observatory Island and other locations at the Archipelago of the Recherche. Extensive collection were also made at Recherche Bay, during his two visits to Tasmania.\nThe preface describes the journey \"from Cape of Good Hope to Australia\", an example of the continent being named as 'Australia' before its popularisation by Flinders' use in A Voyage to Terra Australis. The work includes 256 black-and-white botanical illustrations, including contributions by Pierre-Joseph Redout\u00e9. Copper plates drawn by Pierre Antoine Poiteau and engraved by Auguste Pl\u00e9e were produced for other illustrations.Labillardi\u00e8re had named and described more Australian flora than any other botanist of the day; the work was the most comprehensive until Robert Brown published his Prodromus. This work featured the first descriptions of Cephalotus follicularis, a carnivorous plant, and species Adenanthos obovatus and Gahnia trifida from the southern coast. The collections made at southwest Australia also produced new genera Adenanthos (Proteaceae) and Calytrix (Myrtaceae), species Astartea fascicularis, Hakea clavata and Taxandria marginata, and the first description of the now widely introduced Acacia saligna.  Tasmanian species include Eucryphia lucida (leatherwood) and Phyllocladus aspleniifolius (celery-top pine). The first confirmed collection of Australian bryophytes are described and illustrated by the author; the current name for these species are the mosses Cyathophorum bulbosum and Hypnodendron comosum and a liverwort Hymenophyton flabellatum.Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen has been praised for the accuracy of its descriptions and for the elegant scientific names coined therein. It has been criticised for its imprecision and occasional errors in collection locality and habitat; for example it attributes the collection of Eucalyptus ovata to southwest Australia, but it occurs only in Tasmania and southeast Australia. Labillardi\u00e8re has also been criticised for publishing species based upon specimens collected by other botanists, without providing attribution or acknowledgement for the specimens.The standard abbreviation for the work, Nov. Holl. Pl., is used in botanical literature, and is also known by the title Specimens of the Plants of New Holland. It is the second publication by Labillardi\u00e8re to describe Australian flora; the first was Relation du Voyage \u00e0 la Recherche de la P\u00e9rouse in 1799, a popular account of the voyage in search of the La P\u00e9rouse expedition. The earlier work contains the first description of plant species such as Eucalyptus cornuta.\n\n\n== References ==", "hasanswer": true}]}
{"id": "50_448", "question": "Who is the author of the Antiquities of the Jews?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_20258", "text": "Josephus's Antiquities of the Jews is a vital source for the history of the intertestamental period and the Jewish war against Rome. Antiquities of the Jews is separated into twenty volumes:\n\nIn the preface of Antiquities of the Jews, Josephus provides his motivation for composing such a large work. He writes:\nNow I have undertaken the present work, as thinking it will appear to all the Greeks worthy of their study; for it will contain all our antiquities, and the constitution of our government, as interpreted out of the Hebrew Scriptures.\n\nJosephan scholar Louis Feldman highlights several of the misconceptions about the Jewish people that were being circulated in Josephus's time. In particular, the Jews were thought to lack great historical figures and a credible history of their people. They were also accused of harboring hostility toward non-Jews, and were thought to be generally lacking in loyalty, respect for authority, and charity. With these harsh accusations against the Jews fluttering about the Roman empire, Josephus, set out to provide a Hellenized version of the Jewish history. Such a work is often called an \"apologia,\" as it pleads the case of a group of people or set of beliefs to a larger audience.\nIn order to accomplish this goal, Josephus omitted certain accounts in the Jewish narrative and even added a Hellenistic \"glaze\" to his work. For example, the \"Song of the Sea\" sung by Moses and the people of Israel after their deliverance at the Red Sea is completely omitted in Josephus's text. He does mention, however, that Moses composed a song to God in hexameter\u2014a rather unusual (and Greek) metrical scheme for an ancient Hebrew. Josephus also writes that Abraham taught science to the Egyptians, who in turn taught the Greeks, and that Moses set up a senatorial priestly aristocracy, which like Rome resisted monarchy. Thus, in an attempt to make the Jewish history more palatable to his Greco-Roman audience, the great figures of the biblical stories are presented as ideal philosopher-leaders.\nIn another example, apparently due to his concern with pagan antisemitism, Josephus omitted the entire episode of the golden calf from his account of the Israelites at Mount Sinai. It has been suggested that he was afraid that the biblical account might be employed by Alexandrian antisemites to lend credence to their allegation that the Jews worshiped an ass's head in the Temple (cf. Apion 2:80, 114, 120; Tacitus, Histories 5:4). He also stated that the Ancient Egyptians forced the Jewish slaves to build the pyramids, writing \"They [the Egyptian taskmasters] set them also to build pyramids.\"Josephus also adds a short account of his personal life, Vita, as an appendix to the Judean Antiquities.\nAntiquities of the Jews contains a good deal of valuable, sometimes unique, historical material. This applies, for example, to the history of the Hellenistic states, Parthia, Armenia, the Nabatean kingdom, and the Roman Empire. In the Middle Ages and up to modern times the book was considered one of the most important sources in ancient Roman history, along with the works of Titus Livius, Tacitus, Suetonius, and Jerome. Because of this, Josephus is sometimes called the \"Titus Livius of the Greeks\". The Jewish Encyclopedia speculates that much of Josephus's writings on Herod the Great and his sons draw from the work of Nicolaus of Damascus, a personal friend of Herod's, whose writings remain largely missing; once Nicolaus's narrative on Herod Archelaus ends, Josephus's narrative becomes less detailed. Josephus admitted being familiar with Nicolaus's work but also rebuked Nicolaus for exaggerating Herod's royal claims and benevolence, where Josephus treated Herod as a tyrant.The extant copies of this work contain two passages about Jesus and James the Just. The long one has come to be known as the Testimonium Flavianum. Scholars usually agree on the authenticity of the second passage, while the first one is considered to be authentic, but to have been subjected to Christian interpolation.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Derived partially from Latin rhetoric (through Cicero and Varro), Vitruvian terms for order, arrangement, proportion, and fitness for intended purposes have guided architects for centuries, and continue to do so. \nThe Roman author gives advice on the qualifications of an architect (Book I) and on types of architectural drawing.The ten books or scrolls are organized as follows:\nDe architectura \u2013 Ten Books on Architecture\n\nRoman architects were skilled in engineering, art, and craftsmanship combined. Vitruvius was very much of this type, a fact reflected in De architectura. He covered a wide variety of subjects he saw as touching on architecture. This included many aspects that may seem irrelevant to modern eyes, ranging from mathematics to astronomy, meteorology, and medicine. In the Roman conception, architecture needed to take into account everything touching on the physical and intellectual life of man and his surroundings.\nVitruvius, thus, deals with many theoretical issues concerning architecture. For instance, in Book II of De architectura, he advises architects working with bricks to familiarise themselves with pre-Socratic theories of matter so as to understand how their materials will behave. Book IX relates the abstract geometry of Plato to the everyday work of the surveyor. Astrology is cited for its insights into the organisation of human life, while astronomy is required for the understanding of sundials.

On the 17th of January, 1904, it opened at the Moscow Art Theatre in a production directed by Konstantin Stanislavski. Chekhov described the play as a comedy, with some elements of farce, though Stanislavski treated it as a tragedy. Since its first production, directors have contended with its dual nature. It is often identified as one of the three or four outstanding plays by Chekhov, along with The Seagull, Three Sisters, and Uncle Vanya.The play revolves around an aristocratic Russian landowner who returns to her family estate (which includes a large and well-known cherry orchard) just before it is auctioned to pay the mortgage. Unresponsive to offers to save the estate, she allows its sale to the son of a former serf; the family leaves to the sound of the cherry orchard being cut down.

The Norton Critical Edition of Sense and Sensibility, edited by Claudia Johnson, contains a number of reprinted early reviews in its supplementary material. An \"Unsigned Review\" in the February 1812 Critical Review praises Sense and Sensibility as well-written with well-supported and -drawn characters, realistic, and with a \"highly pleasing\" plot in which \"the whole is just long enough to interest the reader without fatiguing.\" This review praises Mrs. Dashwood, the mother of the Dashwood sisters, as well as Elinor, and claims that Marianne's extreme sensibility makes her miserable. It claims that Sense and Sensibility has a lesson and moral which is made clear through the plot and the characters. Another \"Unsigned Review\" from the May 1812 British Critic further emphasises the novel's function as a type of conduct book. In this author's opinion, Austen's favouring of Elinor's temperament over Marianne's provides the lesson. The review claims that \"the object of the work is to represent the effects on the conduct of life, of discreet quiet good sense on the one hand, and an overrefined and excessive susceptibility on the other.\" The review states that Sense and Sensibility contains \"many sober and salutary maxims for the conduct of life\" within a \"very pleasing and entertaining narrative.\" W. F. Pollock's 1861 review from Frasier's Magazine, titled \"British Novelists\", is what editor Claudia Johnson terms an \"early example of what would become the customary view of Sense and Sensibility.\" In addition to emphasising the novel's morality, Pollock reviews the characters in catalogue-like fashion, praising and criticising them in according to the notion that Austen favours Elinor's point of view and temperament. Pollock even praises Sir John Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, and comments on the humour of Mr. Palmer and his \"silly wife.\" Pollock criticises Sir John Dashwood's selfishness without mentioning Fanny's influence upon them. He also criticises the Steele sisters for their vulgarity.An anonymous piece titled \"Miss Austen\" published in 1866 in The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine departs from other early criticism in its sympathising with Marianne over Elinor, claiming that Elinor is \"too good\" a character. The article also differs from other reviews in that it claims that the \"prevailing merit\" of the book is not in its sketch of the two sisters; rather, the book is effective because of its \"excellent treatment of the subordinate characters.\" Alice Meynell's 1894 article \"The Classic Novelist\" in the Pall Mall Gazette also concurs with Austen's attention to small things. Meynell claims that Austen deals in lesser characters and small matters because \"that which makes life, art, and work trivial is a triviality of relations.\" In her attention to secondary characters, Meynell discusses the children's function to \"illustrate the folly of their mothers,\" especially Lady Middleton.Austen biographer Claire Tomalin argues that Sense and Sensibility has a \"wobble in its approach\", which developed because Austen, in the course of writing the novel, gradually became less certain about whether sense or sensibility should triumph. Austen characterises Marianne as a sweet person with attractive qualities: intelligence, musical talent, frankness, and the capacity to love deeply. She also acknowledges that Willoughby, with all his faults, continues to love and, in some measure, appreciate Marianne. For these reasons, some readers find Marianne's ultimate marriage to Colonel Brandon an unsatisfactory ending.The Dashwood sisters stand apart as being virtually the only characters capable of intelligent thought and any sort of deep thinking. Brownstein wrote that the differences between the Dashwood sisters have been exaggerated, and in fact the sisters are more alike than they are different, with Elinor having an \"excellent heart\" and being capable of the same romantic passions as Marianne feels, while Marianne has much sense as well. Elinor is more reserved, more polite, and less impulsive than Marianne who loves poetry, taking walks across picturesque landscapes and believes in intense romantic relationships, but it is this very closeness between the sisters that allows these differences to emerge during their exchanges.Many critics explore Sense and Sensibility in relation to authors and genres popular during Austen's time. One of the most popular forms of fiction in Austen's time was epistolary fiction. This is a style of writing in which all of the action, dialogue, and character interactions are reflected through letters sent from one or more of the characters. In her book Romantic Correspondence: Women, Politics, and the Fiction of Letters, Mary Favret explores Austen's fraught relationship with epistolary fiction, claiming that Austen \"wrestled with epistolary form\" in previous writings and, with the publication of Sense and Sensibility, \"announced her victory over the constraints of the letter.\" Favret contends that Austen's version of the letter separates her from her \"admired predecessor, Samuel Richardson\" in that Austen's letters are \"a misleading guide to the human heart which, in the best instances, is always changing and adapting.\" According to Favret, the character of Elinor Dashwood is an \"anti-epistolary heroine\" whose \"inner world\" of thoughts and feelings does not find \"direct expression in the novel, although her point of view controls the story.\" Sense and Sensibility establishes what Favret calls a \"new privacy\" in the novel, which was constrained by previous notions of the romance of letters. This new privacy is a \"less constraining mode of narration\" in which Austen's narrator provides commentary on the action, rather than the characters themselves through the letters. Favret claims that in Sense and Sensibility, Austen wants to \"recontextualize\" the letter and bring it into a \"new realism.\" Austen does so by imbuing the letter with dangerous power when Marianne writes to Willoughby; both their love and the letter \"prove false.\" Additionally, Favret claims that Austen uses both of the sisters' letter writing to emphasise the contrasts in their personalities. When both of the sisters write letters upon arriving in London, Elinor's letter is the \"dutiful letter of the 'sensible sister'\" and Marianne writes a \"vaguely illicit letter\" reflecting her characterisation as the \"sensitive\" sister. What is perhaps most striking about Favret's analysis is that she notes that the lovers who write to one another never unite with each other.A common theme of Austen criticism has been on the legal aspects of society and the family, particularly wills, the rights of first and second sons, and lines of inheritance. Gene Ruoff's book Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility explores these issues in a book-length discussion of the novel. Ruoff's first two chapters deal extensively with the subject of wills and the discourse of inheritance. These topics reveal what Ruoff calls \"the cultural fixation on priority of male birth.\" According to Ruoff, male birth is by far the dominant issue in these legal conversations. Ruoff observes that, within the linear family, the order of male birth decides issues of eligibility and merit. When Robert Ferrars becomes his mother's heir, Edward is no longer appealing to his \"opportunistic\" fianc\u00e9e Lucy, who quickly turns her attention to the foppish Robert and \"entraps him\" in order to secure the inheritance for herself. According to Ruoff, Lucy is specifically aiming for the heir because of the monetary advantage. William Galperin, in his book The History Austen, comments on the tendency of this system of patriarchal inheritance and earning as working to ensure the vulnerability of women. Because of this vulnerability, Galperin contends that Sense and Sensibility shows marriage as the only practical solution \"against the insecurity of remaining an unmarried woman.\"Feminist critics have long been engaged in conversations about Jane Austen, and Sense and Sensibility has figured in these discussions, especially about the patriarchal system of inheritance and earning. Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar's seminal feminist work The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Imagination contains several discussions of Sense and Sensibility. Gilbert and Gubar read the beginning of Sense and Sensibility as a retelling of King Lear from a female perspective and contend that these \"reversals imply that male traditions need to be evaluated and reinterpreted from a female perspective.\" Gilbert and Gubar argue that Austen explores the effects of patriarchal control on women, particularly in the spheres of employment and inheritance. In Sense and Sensibility they educe the fact that Mr. John Dashwood sends his stepmother and half sisters from their home as well as promised income, as an instance of these effects. They also point to the \"despised\" Mrs. Ferrars's tampering with the patriarchal line of inheritance in her disowning of her elder son, Edward Ferrars, as proof that this construction is ultimately arbitrary. Gilbert and Gubar contend that while Sense and Sensibility's ultimate message is that \"young women like Marianne and Elinor must submit to powerful conventions of society by finding a male protector,\" women such as Mrs. Ferrars and Lucy Steele demonstrate how women can \"themselves become agents of repression, manipulators of conventions, and survivors.\" In order to protect themselves and their own interests, Mrs. Ferrars and Lucy Steele must participate in the same patriarchal system that oppresses them.\nIn the chapter \"Sense and Sensibility: Opinions Too Common and Too Dangerous\" from her book Jane Austen: Women, Politics, and the Novel, Claudia Johnson also gives a feminist reading of Sense and Sensibility. She differs from previous critics, especially the earliest ones, in her contention that Sense and Sensibility is not, as it is often assumed to be, a \"dramatized conduct book\" that values \"female prudence\" (associated with Elinor's sense) over \"female impetuosity\" (associated with Marianne's sensibility). Rather, Johnson sees Sense and Sensibility as a \"dark and disenchanted novel\" that views \"institutions of order\" such as property, marriage, and family in a negative light, an attitude that makes the novel the \"most attuned to social criticism\" of Austen's works. According to Johnson, Sense and Sensibility critically examines the codes of propriety as well as their enforcement by the community. Key to Austen's criticism of society, runs Johnson's argument, is the depiction of the unfair marginalisation of women resulting from the \"death or simple absence of male protectors.\" Additionally, the male characters in Sense and Sensibility are depicted unfavourably. Johnson calls the gentlemen in Sense and Sensibility \"uncommitted sorts\" who \"move on, more or less unencumbered, by human wreckage from the past.\" In other words, the men do not feel a responsibility to anyone else. Johnson compares Edward to Willoughby in this regard, claiming that all of the differences between them as individuals do not hide the fact that their failures are actually identical; Johnson calls them both \"weak, duplicitous, and selfish,\" lacking the honesty and forthrightness with which Austen endows other \"exemplary gentlemen\" in her work. Johnson's comparison of Edward and Willoughby reveals the depressing picture about gentlemen presented in the novel.\nMary Poovey's analysis in The Proper Lady and the Woman Writer: Ideology as Style in the Works of Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary Shelley and Jane Austen concurs with Johnson's on the dark tone of Sense and Sensibility. Poovey contends that Sense and Sensibility has a \"somber tone\" in which conflict breaks out between Austen's engagement with her \"self-assertive characters\" and the moral codes necessary to control their potentially \"anarchic\" desires. Austen shows, according to Poovey, this conflict between individual desire and the restraint of moral principles through the character of Elinor herself. Except for Elinor, all of the female characters in Sense and Sensibility experience some kind of female excess. Poovey argues that while Austen does recognise \"the limitations of social institutions,\" she demonstrates the necessity of controlling the \"dangerous excesses of female feeling\" rather than liberating them. She does so by demonstrating that Elinor's self-denial, especially in her keeping of Lucy Steele's secret and willingness to help Edward, even though both of these actions were hurtful to her, ultimately contribute to her own contentment and that of others. In this way, Poovey contends that Austen suggests that the submission to society that Elinor demonstrates is the proper way to achieve happiness in life.\nSense and Sensibility criticism also includes ecocritical approaches. Susan Rowland's article \"The 'Real Work': Ecocritical Alchemy and Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility\" studies the effects of alienation upon Edward Ferrars. Edward is alienated from society because he lacks what Rowland calls \"useful employment.\" According to Rowland, Edward's condition represents problems with the history of work in Western industrialised societies. Edward's alienation from work also represents \"the culture evolution of work\" as a \"progressive estrangement from nonhuman nature.\" Rowland argues that human culture estranges people from nature rather than returning them to it. Marianne also suffers from this estrangement of nature as she is ripped from her childhood home where she enjoyed walking the grounds and looking at trees. Rowland thus connects both Edward's and Marianne's progressive discomfort throughout the novel to their alienation from nature.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Hitler's revolutionary goals included expulsion of the Jews from Greater Germany and the unification of German peoples into one Greater Germany. Hitler desired to restore German lands to their greatest historical extent, real or imagined.\nDue to its racist content and the historical effect of Nazism upon Europe during World War II and the Holocaust, it is considered a highly controversial book. Criticism has not come solely from opponents of Nazism. Italian fascist dictator and Nazi ally Benito Mussolini was also critical of the book, saying that it was \"a boring tome that I have never been able to read\" and remarking that Hitler's beliefs, as expressed in the book, were \"little more than commonplace clich\u00e9s\".The German journalist Konrad Heiden, an early critic of the Nazi Party, observed that the content of Mein Kampf is essentially a political argument with other members of the Nazi Party who had appeared to be Hitler's friends, but whom he was actually denouncing in the book's content \u2014 sometimes by not even including references to them.The American literary theorist and philosopher Kenneth Burke wrote a 1939 rhetorical analysis of the work, The Rhetoric of Hitler's \"Battle\", which revealed an underlying message of aggressive intent.The American journalist John Gunther said in 1940 that compared to autobiographies such as Leon Trotsky's My Life or Henry Adams's The Education of Henry Adams, Mein Kampf was \"vapid, vain, rhetorical, diffuse, prolix.\" However, he added that \"it is a powerful and moving book, the product of great passionate feeling\". He suggested that the book exhausted curious German readers, but its \"ceaseless repetition of the argument, left impregnably in their minds, fecund and germinating\".In March 1940, British writer George Orwell reviewed a then-recently published uncensored translation of Mein Kampf for The New English Weekly. Orwell suggested that the force of Hitler's personality shone through the often \"clumsy\" writing, capturing the magnetic allure of Hitler for many Germans. In essence, Orwell notes, Hitler offers only visions of endless struggle and conflict in the creation of \"a horrible brainless empire\" that \"stretch[es] to Afghanistan or thereabouts\". He wrote, \"Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a more grudging way, have said to people 'I offer you a good time,' Hitler has said to them, 'I offer you struggle, danger, and death,' and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his feet.\" Orwell's review was written in the aftermath of the 1939 Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, when Hitler made peace with the USSR after more than a decade of vitriolic rhetoric and threats between the two nations; with the pact in place, Orwell believed, England was now facing a risk of Nazi attack and the UK must not underestimate the appeal of Hitler's ideas.In his 1943 book The Menace of the Herd, Austrian scholar Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn described Hitler's ideas in Mein Kampf and elsewhere as \"a veritable reductio ad absurdum of 'progressive' thought\" and betraying \"a curious lack of original thought\" that shows Hitler offered no innovative or original ideas but was merely \"a virtuoso of commonplaces which he may or may not repeat in the guise of a 'new discovery.'\" Hitler's stated aim, Kuehnelt-Leddihn writes, is to quash individualism in furtherance of political goals:\n\nWhen Hitler and Mussolini attack the \"western democracies\" they insinuate that their \"democracy\" is not genuine. National Socialism envisages abolishing the difference in wealth, education, intellect, taste, philosophy, and habits by a leveling process which necessitates in turn a total control over the child and the adolescent. Every personal attitude will be branded \u2014 after communist pattern \u2014 as \"bourgeois\", and this in spite of the fact that the bourgeois is the representative of the most herdist class in the world, and that National Socialism is a basically bourgeois movement.\nIn Mein Kampf, Hitler repeatedly speaks of the \"masses\" and the \"herd\" referring to the people. The German people should probably, in his view, remain a mass of identical \"individuals\" in an enormous sand heap or ant heap, identical even to the color of their shirts, the garment nearest to the body.\nIn his The Second World War, published in several volumes in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Winston Churchill wrote that he felt that after Hitler's ascension to power, no other book than Mein Kampf deserved more intensive scrutiny.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Tartuffe pretends to be pious and to speak with divine authority, and Orgon and his mother no longer take any action without first consulting him.\nTartuffe's antics do not fool the rest of the family or their friends; they detest him. Orgon raises the stakes when he announces that Tartuffe will marry Orgon's daughter Mariane (who is already engaged to Val\u00e8re).  Mariane becomes very upset at this news, and the rest of the family realizes how deeply Tartuffe has embedded himself into the family.\nIn an effort to show Orgon how awful Tartuffe really is, the family devises a scheme to trap Tartuffe into confessing to Elmire (Orgon's wife) his desire for her. As a pious man and a guest, he should have no such feelings for the lady of the house, and the family hopes that after such a confession, Orgon will throw Tartuffe out of the house. Indeed, Tartuffe does try to seduce Elmire, but their interview is interrupted when Orgon's son Damis, who has been eavesdropping, is no longer able to control his boiling indignation and jumps out of his hiding place to denounce Tartuffe.\n\nTartuffe is at first shocked but recovers very well.  When Orgon enters the room and Damis triumphantly tells him what happened, Tartuffe uses reverse psychology and accuses himself of being the worst sinner:\n\nOrgon is convinced that Damis was lying and banishes him from the house. Tartuffe even convinces Orgon to order that, to teach Damis a lesson, Tartuffe should be around Elmire more than ever. As a gift to Tartuffe and further punishment to Damis and the rest of his family, Orgon signs over all his worldly possessions to Tartuffe.\nIn a later scene, Elmire challenges Orgon to be witness to a meeting between her and Tartuffe. Orgon, ever easily convinced, decides to hide under a table in the same room, confident that Elmire is wrong. He overhears Elmire resisting Tartuffe's very forward advances. When Tartuffe has incriminated himself definitively and is dangerously close to violating Elmire, Orgon comes out from under the table and orders Tartuffe out of his house. The wily guest means to stay, and Tartuffe finally shows his hand. It turns out that earlier, before the events of the play, Orgon had admitted to Tartuffe that he had possession of a box of incriminating letters (written by a friend, not by him). Tartuffe had taken charge and possession of this box, and now tells Orgon that he (Orgon) will be the one to leave. Tartuffe takes his temporary leave. Orgon's family tries to decide what to do. Very soon, Monsieur Loyal shows up with a message from Tartuffe and the court itself; they must exit the house because it now belongs to Tartuffe. Dorine makes fun of Monsieur Loyal's name, mocking his fake loyalty. Even Madame Pernelle, who had refused to believe any ill about Tartuffe even in the face of her son's actually witnessing it, has become convinced of Tartuffe's duplicity.\nNo sooner does Monsieur Loyal leave than Val\u00e8re rushes in with the news that Tartuffe has denounced Orgon for aiding and assisting a traitor by keeping the incriminating letters and that Orgon is about to be arrested. Before Orgon can flee, Tartuffe arrives with an officer, but to his surprise, the officer arrests him instead. The officer explains that the enlightened King Louis XIV\u2014who is not mentioned by name\u2014has heard of the injustices happening in the house and, appalled by Tartuffe's treachery towards Orgon, has ordered Tartuffe's arrest instead. \nIt is revealed that Tartuffe has a long criminal history and has often changed his name to avoid being caught. As a reward for Orgon's previous good services, the king not only forgives him for keeping the letters but also invalidates the deed that gave Tartuffe possession of Orgon's house and possessions. The entire family is thankful that it has escaped the mortification of both Orgon's potential disgrace and their dispossession.\nThe drama ends well, and Orgon announces the upcoming wedding of Val\u00e8re and Mariane.

The Princess of Wales Caroline of Ansbach, wife of George II, had supported Pope in her patronage of the arts. When she and her husband came to the throne in 1727 she had a much busier schedule and thus had less time for Pope, who saw this oversight as a personal slight against him. When planning the Dunciad he based the character Dulness on Queen Caroline, as the fat, lazy and dull wife. The King of the Dunces as the son of Dulness was based on George II. Pope makes his views on the first two Georgian kings very clear in the Dunciad when he writes \"Still Dunce the second reigns like Dunce the first\".\nHowever, Pope's reputation had been impugned, as the full title of Theobald's edition was Shakespeare restored, or, A specimen of the many errors, as well committed, as unamended, by Mr. Pope : in his late edition of this poet. Designed not only to correct the said edition, but to restore the true reading of Shakespeare in all the editions ever yet published.\nPope had written characters of the various \"Dunces\" prior to 1728. In his \"Essay on Criticism\", Pope describes some critics of a witless nature. In his various Moral Epistles, Pope likewise constructs characters of contemporary authors of poor taste. The general structure owes its origins to the communal project of the Scriblerians and other similar works such as the mock-heroic MacFlecknoe by John Dryden and Pope's own The Rape of the Lock.\nThe Scriblerian club most consistently comprised Jonathan Swift, John Gay, John Arbuthnot, Robert Harley, and Thomas Parnell. The group met during the spring and summer of 1714. One group project was to write a satire of contemporary abuses in learning of all sorts, in which the authors would combine their efforts to write the biography of the group's fictional founder, Martin Scriblerus, through whose writings they would accomplish their satirical aims. The resulting The Memoirs of Martin Scriblerus contained a number of parodies of the most lavish mistakes in scholarship.\nFor the mock-heroic structure of the Dunciad itself, however, the idea seems to have come most clearly from MacFlecknoe. MacFlecknoe is a poem celebrating the apotheosis of Thomas Shadwell, whom Dryden nominates as the dullest poet of the age.

The literary fashion was for small, meticulous poems, featuring displays of erudition and paradoxography (the account of marvels and oddities), as represented by the work of Callimachus. In adapting the epic genre to this audience, Apollonius went a long way towards inventing the romance novel, including narrative techniques like the \"interior monologue\", whereby the author identifies with a character's thoughts and feelings.

In fact, Eco has stated that his intention was to find a \"totally neutral title\". In one version of the story, when he had finished writing the novel, Eco hurriedly suggested some ten names for it and asked a few of his friends to choose one. They chose The Name of the Rose. In another version of the story, Eco had wanted the neutral title Adso of Melk, but that was vetoed by his publisher, and then the title The Name of the Rose \"came to me virtually by chance.\" In the Postscript to the Name of the Rose, Eco claims to have chosen the title \"because the rose is a symbolic figure so rich in meanings that by now it hardly has any meaning left\".The book's last line, \"Stat rosa pristina nomine, nomina nuda tenemus\" translates as: \"the rose of old remains only in its name; we possess naked names.\" The general sense, as Eco pointed out, was that from the beauty of the past, now disappeared, we hold only the name. In this novel, the lost \"rose\" could be seen as Aristotle's book on comedy (now forever lost), the exquisite library now destroyed, or the beautiful peasant girl now dead.\nThis text has also been translated as \"Yesterday's rose stands only in name, we hold only empty names.\" This line is a verse by twelfth century monk Bernard of Cluny (also known as Bernard of Morlaix). Medieval manuscripts of this line are not in agreement: Eco quotes one Medieval variant verbatim, but Eco was not aware at the time of the text more commonly printed in modern editions, in which the reference is to Rome (Roma), not to a rose (rosa). The alternative text, with its context, runs: Nunc ubi Regulus aut ubi Romulus aut ubi Remus? / Stat Roma pristina nomine, nomina nuda tenemus. This translates as \"Where now is Regulus, or Romulus, or Remus? / Primordial Rome abides only in its name; we hold only naked names.\"The title may also be an allusion to the nominalist position in the problem of universals, taken by William of Ockham. According to nominalism, universals are bare names: there is not a universal rose, only a bunch of particular flowers that we artificially singled out by naming them \"roses\".A further possible inspiration for the title may be a poem by the Mexican poet and mystic Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz (1651\u20131695):\n\nThis poem appears in Eco's Postscript to the Name of the Rose, and is translated into English in \"Note 1\" of that book as:", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "50_473", "question": "Who is the author of the German epic \"Parzival\"?", "ctxs": [{"id": "674_54632", "text": "The Nibelungenlied, like other Middle High German heroic epics, is anonymous. This anonymity extends to discussions of literature in other Middle High German works: although it is common practice to judge or praise the poems of others, no other poet refers to the author of the Nibelungenlied. Attempts to identify the Nibelungenlied-poet with known authors, such as Bligger von Steinach, to whom a lost epic is attributed by Gottfried von Strassburg, have not found wide acceptance. The poem is nevertheless believed to have had a single author, possibly working in a \"Nibelungen workshop\" (\"Nibelungenwerkstatt\") together with the author of the Nibelungenklage. The latter work identifies a \"meister Konrad\" as the author of an original Latin version of the Nibelungenlied, but this is generally taken for a fiction. Although a single Nibelungenlied-poet is often posited, the degree of variance in the text and its background in an amorphous oral tradition mean that ideas of authorial intention must be applied with caution. It is also possible that there were several poets involved, perhaps under the direction of a single \"leader\" who could be considered the \"Nibelungenlied-poet\".The Nibelungenlied is conventionally dated to around the year 1200. Wolfram von Eschenbach references the cook Rumolt, usually taken to be an invention of the Nibelungenlied-poet, in his romance Parzival (c. 1204/5), thereby providing an upper bound on the date the epic must have been composed. Additionally, the poem's rhyming technique most closely resembles that used between 1190 and 1205. Attempts to show that the poem alludes to various historical events have generally not been convincing.The current theory of the creation of the poem emphasizes the poet's concentration on the region of Passau: for example, the poem highlights the relatively unimportant figure of Bishop Pilgrim of Passau, and the poet's geographical knowledge appears much more firm in this region than elsewhere. These facts, combined with the dating, have led scholars to believe that Wolfger von Erla, Bishop of Passau (reigned 1191\u20131204) was the patron of the poem. Wolfger is known to have patronized other literary figures, such as Walther von der Vogelweide and Thomasin von Zirclaere. The attention paid to Bishop Pilgrim, who represents the real historical figure Bishop Pilgrim of Passau, would thus be an indirect homage to Wolfger. Wolfger was, moreover, attempting to establish the sainthood of Pilgrim at the time of the poem's composition, giving an additional reason for his prominence.Some debate exists as to whether the poem is an entirely new creation or whether there was a previous version. German medievalist Jan-Dirk M\u00fcller claims that the poem in its written form is entirely new, although he admits the possibility that an orally transmitted epic with relatively consistent contents could have preceded it. German philologist Elisabeth Lienert, on the other hand, posits an earlier version of the text from around 1150 due to the Nibelungenlied's use of a stanzaic form current around that time (see Form and style).Whoever the poet may have been, they appear to have had a knowledge of German Minnesang and chivalric romance. The poem's concentration on love (minne) and its depiction of Siegfried as engaging in love service for Kriemhild is in line with courtly romances of the time, with Heinrich von Veldeke's Eneasroman perhaps providing concrete models. Other possible influences are Hartmann von Aue's Iwein and Erec. These courtly elements are described by Jan-Dirk M\u00fcller as something of a fa\u00e7ade, under which the older heroic ethos of the poem remains. Additionally, the poet seems to have known Latin literature. The role given to Kriemhild in the second (originally first) stanza is suggestive of Helen of Troy, and the poem appears to have taken a number of elements from Vergil's Aeneid. There is some debate as to whether the poet was acquainted with Old French chanson de geste.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is widely considered the pre-eminent work in Italian literature and one of the greatest works of Western literature. The poem's imaginative vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval worldview as it existed in the Western Church by the 14th century. It helped establish the Tuscan language, in which it is written, as the standardized Italian language. It is divided into three parts: Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso.\nThe poem discusses \"the state of the soul after death and presents an image of divine justice meted out as due punishment or reward\", and describes Dante's travels through Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven. Allegorically, the poem represents the soul's journey towards God, beginning with the recognition and rejection of sin (Inferno), followed by the penitent Christian life (Purgatorio), which is then followed by the soul's ascent to God (Paradiso). Dante draws on medieval Catholic theology and philosophy, especially Thomistic philosophy derived from the Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas. Consequently, the Divine Comedy has been called \"the Summa in verse\".In the poem, the pilgrim Dante is accompanied by three guides: Virgil, who represents human reason, and who guides him for all of Inferno and most of Purgatorio; Beatrice, who represents divine revelation in addition to theology, grace, and faith; and guides him from the end of Purgatorio onwards; and Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, who represents contemplative mysticism and devotion to Mary the Mother, guiding him in the final cantos of Paradiso.The work was originally simply titled Comed\u00eca (pronounced [kome\u02c8di\u02d0a], Tuscan for \"Comedy\") \u2013 so also in the first printed edition, published in 1472 \u2013 later adjusted to the modern Italian Commedia. The adjective Divina was added by Giovanni Boccaccio, owing to its subject matter and lofty style, and the first edition to name the poem Divina Comedia in the title was that of the Venetian humanist Lodovico Dolce, published in 1555 by Gabriele Giolito de' Ferrari.\nErich Auerbach said Dante was the first writer to depict human beings as the products of a specific time, place and circumstance, as opposed to mythic archetypes or a collection of vices and virtues, concluding that this, along with the fully imagined world of the Divine Comedy, suggests that the Divine Comedy inaugurated realism and self-portraiture in modern fiction.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He had been considering the subject of Salome since his undergraduate days at Oxford when Walter Pater introduced him to Flaubert's story H\u00e9rodias in 1877.

The play was written in Paris some six months ago, where I read it to some young poets, who admired it immensely. Of course, there are modes of expression that a Frenchman of letters would not have used, but they give a certain relief or colour to the play.\nHe submitted the play to the leading French actress Sarah Bernhardt, who accepted it for production in her 1892 season at the Royal English Opera House, in London. The play went into rehearsals in June, but at that time all plays presented in Britain had to be approved by the official censor, the Lord Chamberlain. Approval was withheld because of a rule prohibiting the depiction of biblical characters on stage. Wilde expressed outrage and said he would leave England and take French citizenship. Bernhardt too condemned the ban and said she would present the play in Paris at some time, although she could not say when.The play was published in French in 1893 in Paris by the Librairie de l'Art Independent and in London by Elkin Mathews and John Lane.

The exact date is stated within the poem as being the ninth day of the month of Chaitra, which is the birthday of Rama, Rama Navami. Ramcharitmanas was composed at Ayodhya, Varanasi and Chitrakoot.The Ramcharitmanas is written in vernacular Awadhi language. The core of the work is considered by some to be a poetic retelling of the events of the Sanskrit epic Ramayana[1] by Valmiki. The Valmiki Ramayana is centered on the narrative of Rama, the scion of the family tree of king Raghu of the Sun Dynasty. Rama was the crown prince of Ayodhya and is considered in Hindu tradition as the seventh Avatar of Vishnu. However, the Ramacharitmanas is by no means a word-to-word copy of the Valmiki Ramayana nor an abridged re-telling of the latter. Ramcaritmanas has elements from many other Ramayanas written earlier in Sanskrit, and other Indian dialects as well as stories from Puranas. Tulsidas is said to have some spiritual powers to see the events occurred till Tretayuga that he used to narrate Ramcharitmanas. Tulsidas himself never writes Ramcharitmanas as being a retelling of Valmiki Ramayana. He calls the epic Ramcharitmanas as the story of Rama, that was stored in the mind (M\u0101nasa) of Shiva before he narrated the same to his wife Parvati. Tulsidas claims to have received the story through his guru, Narharidas.Tulsidas was a naive (Acheta) child and the story was stored in his mind (M\u0101nasa) for long before he wrote it down as Ramcharitmanas. Some understand this passage of the Ramcharitmanas to mean that Tulsidas at first could not grasp the story fully as he was a na\u00efve young boy. His guru graciously repeated it again and again so that he could understand and remember it. Then he narrated the story and named it Ramcharitmanas as Shiva himself called it. The epic poem is, therefore, also referred to as Tulsikrit Ramayana (literally, The Ramayana composed by Tulsidas).", "hasanswer": false}]}

There is a certain feeling of monotony inescapable in the regularity of the deaths which is better suited to a serialized newspaper story than a full-length novel. Yet there is an ingenious problem to solve in naming the murderer\", he continued. \"It will be an extremely astute reader who guesses correctly.\"For The New York Times Book Review (25 February 1940), Isaac Anderson has arrived to the point where \"the voice\" accuses the ten \"guests\" of their past crimes, which have all resulted in the deaths of humans, and then said, \"When you read what happens after that you will not believe it, but you will keep on reading, and as one incredible event is followed by another even more incredible you will still keep on reading. The whole thing is utterly impossible and utterly fascinating. It is the most baffling mystery that Agatha Christie has ever written, and if any other writer has ever surpassed it for sheer puzzlement the name escapes our memory. We are referring, of course, to mysteries that have logical explanations, as this one has. It is a tall story, to be sure, but it could have happened.\"Many compared the book to her 1926 novel The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. For instance, an unnamed reviewer in the Toronto Daily Star of 16 March 1940 said, \"Others have written better mysteries than Agatha Christie, but no one can touch her for ingenious plot and surprise ending. With And Then There Were None... she is at her most ingenious and most surprising... is, indeed, considerably above the standard of her last few works and close to the Roger Ackroyd level.\"Other critics laud the use of plot twists and surprise endings. Maurice Richardson wrote a rhapsodic review in The Observer's issue of 5 November 1939 which began, \"No wonder Agatha Christie's latest has sent her publishers into a vatic trance. We will refrain, however, from any invidious comparisons with Roger Ackroyd and be content with saying that Ten Little Niggers is one of the very best, most genuinely bewildering Christies yet written. We will also have to refrain from reviewing it thoroughly, as it is so full of shocks that even the mildest revelation would spoil some surprise from somebody, and I am sure that you would rather have your entertainment kept fresh than criticism pure.\" After stating the set-up of the plot, Richardson concluded, \"Story telling and characterisation are right at the top of Mrs Christie's baleful form. Her plot may be highly artificial, but it is neat, brilliantly cunning, soundly constructed, and free from any of those red-herring false trails which sometimes disfigure her work.\"Robert Barnard, writing in 1990, concurred with the early reviews, describing the book as \"Suspenseful and menacing detective-story-cum-thriller. The closed setting with the succession of deaths is here taken to its logical conclusion, and the dangers of ludicrousness and sheer reader-disbelief are skillfully avoided. Probably the best-known Christie, and justifiably among the most popular.\"The original title of the mystery (Ten Little Niggers) was changed because it was offensive.  Alison Light, a literary critic and feminist scholar, opined that Christie's original title and the setting on \"Nigger Island\" (later changed to \"Indian Island\" and \"Soldier Island\", variously) were integral to the work. These aspects of the novel, she argued, \"could be relied upon automatically to conjure up a thrilling 'otherness', a place where revelations about the 'dark side' of the English would be appropriate.\" Unlike novels such as Heart of Darkness, \"Christie's location is both more domesticated and privatized, taking for granted the construction of racial fears woven into psychic life as early as the nursery. If her story suggests how easy it is to play upon such fears, it is also a reminder of how intimately tied they are to sources of pleasure and enjoyment.\"In 1990 Crime Writers' Association ranked And Then There Were None 19th in their The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time list. In 1995 in a similar list Mystery Writers of America ranked the novel 10th.

It is widely considered the pre-eminent work in Italian literature and one of the greatest works of Western literature. The poem's imaginative vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval worldview as it existed in the Western Church by the 14th century. It helped establish the Tuscan language, in which it is written, as the standardized Italian language. It is divided into three parts: Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso.\nThe poem discusses \"the state of the soul after death and presents an image of divine justice meted out as due punishment or reward\", and describes Dante's travels through Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven. Allegorically, the poem represents the soul's journey towards God, beginning with the recognition and rejection of sin (Inferno), followed by the penitent Christian life (Purgatorio), which is then followed by the soul's ascent to God (Paradiso). Dante draws on medieval Catholic theology and philosophy, especially Thomistic philosophy derived from the Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas. Consequently, the Divine Comedy has been called \"the Summa in verse\".In the poem, the pilgrim Dante is accompanied by three guides: Virgil, who represents human reason, and who guides him for all of Inferno and most of Purgatorio; Beatrice, who represents divine revelation in addition to theology, grace, and faith; and guides him from the end of Purgatorio onwards; and Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, who represents contemplative mysticism and devotion to Mary the Mother, guiding him in the final cantos of Paradiso.The work was originally simply titled Comed\u00eca (pronounced [kome\u02c8di\u02d0a], Tuscan for \"Comedy\") \u2013 so also in the first printed edition, published in 1472 \u2013 later adjusted to the modern Italian Commedia. The adjective Divina was added by Giovanni Boccaccio, owing to its subject matter and lofty style, and the first edition to name the poem Divina Comedia in the title was that of the Venetian humanist Lodovico Dolce, published in 1555 by Gabriele Giolito de' Ferrari.\nErich Auerbach said Dante was the first writer to depict human beings as the products of a specific time, place and circumstance, as opposed to mythic archetypes or a collection of vices and virtues, concluding that this, along with the fully imagined world of the Divine Comedy, suggests that the Divine Comedy inaugurated realism and self-portraiture in modern fiction.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The text may have started in the 1st millennium BCE, expanded over time, and most scholars suggest, based on mention of this text in other Indian literature, that the first complete version of the text was likely finished between 200 BCE to 200 CE. The N\u0101\u1e6dya\u015b\u0101stra is traditionally alleged to be linked to a 36,000 verse Vedic composition called Adibharata, however there is no corroborating evidence that such a text ever existed.The text has survived into the modern age in several manuscript versions, wherein the title of the chapters varies and in some cases the content of the few chapters differ. Some recensions show significant interpolations and corruption of the text, along with internal contradictions and sudden changes in style. Scholars such as PV Kane state that some text was likely changed as well as added to the original between the 3rd to 8th century CE, thus creating some variant editions, and the mixture of poetic verses and prose in a few extant manuscripts of Natyashastra may be because of this. According to Pramod Kale, who received a doctorate on the text from the University of Wisconsin, the surviving version of Natya Shastra likely existed by the 8th-century.The author of the Natya Shastra is unknown, and the Hindu tradition attributes it to the Rishi (sage) Bharata. It may be the work of several authors, but scholars disagree. Bharat Gupt states that the text stylistically shows characteristics of a single compiler in the existing version, a view shared by Kapila Vatsyayan.

Leiber then included Alyx in two Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories, \"The Two Best Thieves in Lankhmar\" (1968) and \"Under the Thumbs of the Gods\" (1975).In Terry Pratchett's The Colour of Magic (1983), Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser are parodied as Bravd and the Weasel. Although Ankh-Morpork bears more than a passing resemblance to Lankhmar, Pratchett, known for the use of pastiche in his early works, has been quoted as not intending a direct takeoff.American author Michael Chabon's Gentlemen of the Road (2007) is a \"swashbuckling adventure\" novel  set in the kaganate of Khazaria (now southwest Russia) around AD 950.

The period during which the Mishnah was assembled spanned about 130 years, or five generations, in the first and second centuries CE. Judah ha-Nasi is credited with the final redaction and publication of the Mishnah, although there have been a few additions since his time: those passages that cite him or his grandson (Judah II), and the end of tractate Sotah (which refers to the period after Judah's death). In addition to redacting the Mishnah, Judah and his court also ruled on which opinions should be followed, although the rulings do not always appear in the text.\nMost of the Mishnah is related without attribution (stam). This usually indicates that many sages taught so, or that Judah the Prince ruled so. The halakhic ruling usually follows that view. Sometimes, however, it appears to be the opinion of a single sage, and the view of the sages collectively (Hebrew: \u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05d9\u05dd, hachamim) is given separately.\nAs Judah the Prince went through the tractates, the Mishnah was set forth, but throughout his life some parts were updated as new information came to light. Because of the proliferation of earlier versions, it was deemed too hard to retract anything already released, and therefore a second version of certain laws were released. The Talmud refers to these differing versions as Mishnah Rishonah (\"First Mishnah\") and Mishnah Acharonah (\"Last Mishnah\"). David Zvi Hoffmann suggests that Mishnah Rishonah actually refers to texts from earlier Sages upon which Rebbi based his Mishnah.\nThe Talmud records a tradition that unattributed statements of the law represent the views of Rabbi Meir (Sanhedrin 86a), which supports the theory (recorded by Sherira Gaon in his famous Iggeret) that he was the author of an earlier collection. For this reason, the few passages that actually say \"this is the view of Rabbi Meir\" represent cases where the author intended to present Rabbi Meir's view as a \"minority opinion\" not representing the accepted law.\nThere are also references to the \"Mishnah of Rabbi Akiva\", suggesting a still earlier collection; on the other hand, these references may simply mean his teachings in general. Another possibility is that Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Meir established the divisions and order of subjects in the Mishnah, making them the authors of a school curriculum rather than of a book.\nAuthorities are divided on whether Rabbi Judah the Prince recorded the Mishnah in writing or established it as an oral text for memorisation. The most important early account of its composition, the Iggeret Rav Sherira Gaon (Epistle of Rabbi Sherira Gaon) is ambiguous on the point, although the Spanish recension leans to the theory that the Mishnah was written. However, the Talmud records that, in every study session, there was a person called the tanna appointed to recite the Mishnah passage under discussion. This may indicate that, even if the Mishnah was reduced to writing, it was not available on general distribution.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Mormons, however, have a relatively open definition of scripture. As a general rule, anything spoken or written by a prophet, while under inspiration, is considered to be the word of God. Thus, the Bible, written by prophets and apostles, is the word of God, so far as it is translated correctly. The Book of Mormon is also believed to have been written by ancient prophets and is viewed as a companion to the Bible. By this definition, the teachings of Smith's successors are also accepted as scripture, though they are always measured against and draw heavily from the scriptural canon.\nMormons believe in \"a friendly universe\" governed by a God whose aim is to bring his children to immortality and eternal life. Mormons have a unique perspective on the nature of God, the origin of man, and the purpose of life. For instance, Mormons believe in a pre-mortal existence where people were literal spirit children of God and that God presented a plan of salvation that would allow his children to progress and become more like him. The plan involved the spirits receiving bodies on earth and going through trials in order to learn, progress, and receive a \"fullness of joy\". The most important part of the plan involved Jesus, the eldest of God's children, coming to earth as the literal Son of God to conquer sin and death so that God's other children could return. According to Mormons, every person who lives on earth will be resurrected, and nearly all of them will be received into various kingdoms of glory. To be accepted into the highest kingdom, a person must fully accept Christ through faith, repentance, and through ordinances such as baptism and the laying on of hands.\nAccording to Mormons, a deviation from the original principles of Christianity, known as the Great Apostasy, began not long after the ascension of Jesus Christ. It was marked by the corruption of Christian doctrine by Greek and other philosophies, with followers dividing into different ideological groups. Mormons claim the martyrdom of the apostles led to a loss of priesthood authority to administer the church and its ordinances.\nMormons believe that God restored the early Christian church through Joseph Smith. In particular, Mormons believe that angels such as Peter, James, John, John the Baptist, Moses, and Elijah appeared to Smith and others and bestowed various priesthood authorities on them. Mormons believe that their church is the \"only true and living church\" because of the divine authority restored through Smith. Mormons self-identify as being Christian, while many Christians, particularly evangelical Protestants, disagree with this view. Mormons view other religions as having portions of the truth, doing good works, and having genuine value.The LDS Church has a top-down hierarchical structure with a president\u2013prophet dictating revelations for the entire church. Lay Mormons are also believed to have access to inspiration and are encouraged to seek their own personal revelations. Mormons see Joseph Smith's First Vision as proof that the heavens are open and that God answers prayers. They place considerable emphasis on \"asking God\" to find out if something is true. Most Mormons do not claim to have had heavenly visions like Smith's in response to prayers but feel that God talks to them in their hearts and minds through the Holy Ghost. Though Mormons have some beliefs that are considered strange in a modernized world, they continue to hold onto their beliefs because they feel God has spoken to them.", "hasanswer": false}]}
{"id": "50_494", "question": "Who is the author of the Four Books of Sentences?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_20539", "text": "The Book of Sentences had its precursor in the glosses (an explanation or interpretation of a text, such as, e.g. the Corpus Iuris Civilis or biblical) by the masters who lectured using Saint Jerome's Latin translation of the Bible (the Vulgate). A gloss might concern syntax or grammar, or it might be on some difficult point of doctrine. These glosses, however, were not continuous, rather being placed between the lines or in the margins of the biblical text itself. Lombard went a step further, collecting texts from various sources (such as scripture, Augustine of Hippo, and other Church Fathers) and compiling them into one coherent whole. In order to accomplish this, he had to address two tasks: first, that of devising an order for his material, because systematic theology had not yet been constituted as a discipline, and secondly, finding ways to reconcile doctrinal differences among his sources. Peter Abelard's Sic et Non provided crucial inspiration for the latter tasks.\nLombard arranged his material from the Bible and the Church Fathers in four books, then subdivided this material further into chapters. Probably between 1223 and 1227, Alexander of Hales grouped the many chapters of the four books into a smaller number of \"distinctions\". In this form, the book was widely adopted as a theological textbook in the high and late Middle Ages (the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries). A commentary on the Sentences was required of every master of theology, and was part of the examination system. At the end of lectures on Lombard's work, a student could apply for bachelor status within the theology faculty.\nThe importance of the Sentences to medieval theology and philosophy lies to a significant extent in the overall framework they provide to theological and philosophical discussion. All the great scholastic thinkers, such as Aquinas, William of Ockham, Bonaventure, Petrus Aureolus, Robert Holcot, and Duns Scotus, wrote commentaries on the Sentences. But these works were not exactly commentaries, for the Sentences was really a compilation of sources, and Lombard left many questions open, giving later scholars an opportunity to provide their own answers.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The author's excursion into England was generally judged a success, the forest outlaws and the creation of 'merry England' attracting particular praise. Rebecca was almost unanimously admired, especially in her farewell scene. The plot was either criticised for its weakness, or just regarded as of less importance than the scenes and characters. The scenes at Torquilstone were judged horrible by several critics, with special focus on Ulrica. Athelstane's resurrection found no favour, the kindest response being that of Francis Jeffrey in  The Edinburgh Review who suggested (writing anonymously, like all the reviewers) that it was 'introduced out of the very wantonness of merriment'.\nLetitia Elizabeth Landon, who was a devotee of Scott's, wrote a poetical illustration to a picture  of  The Tournament. by Thomas Allom in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1838.The Eglinton Tournament of 1839 held by the 13th Earl of Eglinton at Eglinton Castle in Ayrshire was inspired by and modelled on Ivanhoe.\nOn November 5, 2019, the BBC News listed Ivanhoe on its list of the 100 most influential novels.", "hasanswer": false}]}

HarperCollins took over publication of the series in 1994 and made the unusual decision to ignore the changes that Lewis had made and use the earlier text as the standard for their editions.In Dawn Treader, Lewis made two changes, one minor and one more substantial. The minor change appears in the first chapter where Lewis changes the description of Eustace from \"far too stupid to make anything up himself\" to \"quite incapable of making anything up himself\". Paul Ford, author of Companion to Narnia, suggests that Lewis might have felt the need to soften the passage for his American readers or perhaps he was starting to like Eustace better. Peter Schakel, author of Imagination and the arts in C.S. Lewis, notes that the passage should have been changed in both cases as \"calling a character 'stupid' in a children's book is insensitive and unwise\". Both Schakel and Ford agree that it is not an accurate depiction of Eustace as Lewis describes him, and this too may be the reason for the change.\nThe more substantive change appears in Chapter 12, \"The Dark Island\", where Lewis rewrote the ending in a way that, Schakel maintains, improves the imaginative experience considerably.\n\nThe reader cannot [in this version] dismiss the island as unreal or as no longer existing: it is still there, and anyone who can get to Narnia still could get caught in it.

Otherwise: nice one.\"Dave Langford also reviewed Neuromancer for White Dwarf #80, and stated that \"You may not believe in killer programs which invade the brain, but Neuromancer, if you once let it into your wetware, isn't easily erased.\"Neuromancer was released without fanfare, but it quickly became an underground word-of-mouth hit. It became the first novel to win  the Nebula, the Hugo, and Philip K. Dick Award for paperback original, an unprecedented achievement described by the Mail & Guardian as \"the sci-fi writer's version of winning the Goncourt, Booker and Pulitzer prizes in the same year\". The novel thereby legitimized cyberpunk as a mainstream branch of science fiction literature. It is among the most-honored works of science fiction in recent history, and appeared on Time magazine's list of 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. The novel was also nominated for a British Science Fiction Award in 1984.Neuromancer is considered \"the archetypal cyberpunk work\". Outside science fiction, it gained unprecedented critical and popular attention as an \"evocation of life in the late 1980s\", although The Observer noted that \"it took the New York Times 10 years\" to mention the novel. By 2007 it had sold more than 6.5 million copies worldwide.The novel has had significant linguistic influence, popularizing such terms as cyberspace and ICE (Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics). Gibson himself coined the term \"cyberspace\" in his novelette \"Burning Chrome\", published in 1982 by Omni magazine, but it was through its use in Neuromancer that it gained recognition to become the de facto term for the World Wide Web during the 1990s. The portion of Neuromancer usually cited in this respect is:\n\nThe matrix has its roots in primitive arcade games. \u2026 Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts. \u2026 A graphic representation of data abstracted from banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding.\nThe 1999 cyberpunk science fiction film The Matrix particularly draws from Neuromancer both eponym and usage of the term \"matrix\". \"After watching The Matrix, Gibson commented that the way that the film's creators had drawn from existing cyberpunk works was 'exactly the kind of creative cultural osmosis\" he had relied upon in his own writing.'\"In his afterword to the 2000 re-issue of Neuromancer, fellow author Jack Womack goes as far as to suggest that Gibson's vision of cyberspace may have inspired the way in which the Internet developed (particularly the World Wide Web), after the publication of Neuromancer in 1984. He asks \"[w]hat if the act of writing it down, in fact, brought it about?\"\nWriting in F&SF in 2005, Charles de Lint noted that while Gibson's technological extrapolations had proved imperfect (in particular, his failure to anticipate the cellular telephone), \"Imagining story, the inner workings of his characters' minds, and the world in which it all takes place are all more important.\"Lawrence Person in his \"Notes Toward a Postcyberpunk Manifesto\" (1998) identified Neuromancer as \"the archetypal cyberpunk work\". Literary critic Larry McCaffery described the concept of the matrix in Neuromancer as a place where \"data dance with human consciousness... human memory is literalized and mechanized... multi-national information systems mutate and breed into startling new structures whose beauty and complexity are unimaginable, mystical, and above all nonhuman.\" Gibson later commented on himself as an author circa Neuromancer that \"I'd buy him a drink, but I don't know if I'd loan him any money,\" and referred to the novel as \"an adolescent's book\".

Individual poems detail the deeds of various knights, including Lancelot, Geraint, Galahad, and Balin and Balan, and also Merlin and the Lady of the Lake. There is little transition between Idylls, but the central figure of Arthur links all the stories. The poems were dedicated to the late Albert, Prince Consort.\nThe Idylls are written in blank verse. Tennyson's descriptions of nature are derived from observations of his own surroundings, collected over the course of many years. The dramatic narratives are not an epic either in structure or tone, but derive elegiac sadness in the style of the idylls of Theocritus.

Tolkien\u2019s The Lord of the Rings, to Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows,  and Richard Adams's Watership Down. Jacques combines \"action, poetry, songs, courage, and vivid descriptions\" to create a unique style that spans the series.The Redwall series has received praise for its \"equal-opportunity adventuring, in which female creatures can be just as courageous (or as diabolical) as their male counterparts\". Novels such as Mariel of Redwall, Pearls of Lutra, High Rhulain and Triss all feature strong female leading characters. Jacques has also received acclaim for his development of unique language intrinsic to certain species, giving the novels an \"endearing dialectal dialogue\".Some reviews have been critical of the Redwall novels for providing too simplistic a view of good and evil. The characteristics of the animals in the novels are fixed by their species, making them quite \"predictable\", though there have been a few books, such as in Outcast of Redwall and Pearls of Lutra, in which vermin have acted selflessly, in one taking a spear through the chest and back meant for his former nursemaid, and in the other saving the Abbot of Redwall from lizards. Another exception is in The Bellmaker, where a searat strove to start being good instead of evil, abandoning his life of pirating to live by himself. In some cases, different members of the same species possess different moral compasses. For example, the wildcats in the book Mossflower each exhibit different characteristics: although Lady Tsarmina is cruel and vicious, her father Lord Verdauga is seen as hard but fair, and her brother Gingivere is kind and eventually joins the side of the woodlanders. As a general rule though, characters tend to \"epitomize their class origins\", rarely rising above them.Many reviewers have also criticized the Redwall series for repetition and predictability, citing \"recycled\" plot lines and Jacques' tendency to follow a \"pattern to the dot\". Other reviewers note that such predictable \"ingredients\" may be what \"makes the Redwall recipe so consistently popular\".

In another context, it refers to a spondee in Sanskrit prosody. In the Mahabharata and the Puranas, it is the name of a warrior character. Called Vasusena as a child by his foster parents, he became known by the name Karna because of the golden earrings of Surya he used to wear, according to the Sanskrit epics scholar David Slavitt.The word Karna, states the Indologist Kevin McGrath, signifies \"eared, or the ear-ringed one\". In section 3.290.5 of the Mahabharata, Karna is described as a baby born with the ear-rings and armoured breastplate, like his father Surya.\nThe second meaning of Karna as \"rudder and helm\" is also an apt metaphor given Karna's role in steering the war in Book 8 of the epic, where the good Karna confronts the good Arjuna, one of the climax scenes wherein the Mahabharata authors repeatedly deploy the allegories of ocean and boat to embed layers of meanings in the poem. For example, his first entry into the Kurukshetra battlefield is presented as the Makara movement (an arrangement of soldiers in the sea-monster pattern). As Duryodhana's army crumbles each day, the sea and vessel metaphor repeatedly appears in the epic, particularly when Karna is mentioned. As a newborn, Karna's life begins in a basket without a rudder on a river, in circumstances that he neither chose nor had a say. In Book 1, again in the context of Karna, Duryodhana remarks, \"the origins of heroes and rivers are indeed difficult to understand\".The name Karna is also symbolically connected to the central aspect of Karna's character as the one who is intensely preoccupied with what others hear and think about him, about his fame, a weakness that others exploit to manipulate him. This \"hearing\" and \"that which is heard\", states McGrath makes \"Karna\" an apt name and subtle reminder of Karna's driving motivation.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Plato shows off his master as a man of high moral standards, unstirred by baser urges and fully committed to the study and practice of proper self-government in both individuals and communities (the so-called \"royal science\"). The dialogue's ending contrasts Socrates' intellectual and emotional self-mastery with Alcibiades' debauchery and lack of moderation to explain the latter's reckless political career, disastrous military campaigns, and eventual demise. Alcibiades is corrupted by his physical beauty and its advantages; he ultimately fails to ascend to the Form of Beauty through philosophy.\nMartha Nussbaum considers the possibility that the Symposium is intended to criticize Socrates and his philosophy, and to reject certain aspects of his behavior, and that Plato intends to portray Socratic philosophy as something that has lost touch with the actual individual as it devoted itself to abstract principles.One critic, James Arieti, considers that the Symposium resembles a drama, with emotional and dramatic events occurring especially when Alcibiades crashes the banquet. Arieti suggests that it should be studied more as a drama, with a focus on character and actions, and less as an exploration of philosophical ideas. This suggests that the characters speak, as in a play, not as the author, but as themselves. This theory, Arieti has found, reveals how much each of the speakers of the Symposium resembles the god, Eros, that they each are describing. It may be Plato's point to suggest that when humankind talks about god, they are drawn towards creating that god in their own image.Andrew Dalby considers the opening pages of the Symposium the best depiction in any ancient Greek source of the way texts are transmitted by oral tradition without writing.  It shows how an oral text may have no simple origin, and how it can be passed along by repeated tellings, and by different narrators, and how it can be sometimes verified, and sometimes corrupted. The story of the symposium is being told by Apollodorus to his friend.  Apollodorus was not himself at the banquet, but heard the story from Aristodemus, a man who was there.  Also, Apollodorus was able to confirm parts of the story with Socrates himself, who was one of the speakers at the banquet. In addition, the story that Socrates narrates when it is his turn to speak was told to Socrates by Diotima.Walter Hamilton remarks that Plato takes care to portray Alcibiades and Socrates and their relationship in a way that makes it clear that Socrates had not been a bad influence on Alcibiades. Plato does this to free his teacher from the guilt of corrupting the minds of prominent youths, which had, in fact, earned Socrates the death sentence in 399 BC.", "hasanswer": false}]}

First performed on 14 February 1895 at the St James's Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious personae to escape burdensome social obligations. Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage and the resulting satire of Victorian conformity. Some contemporary reviews praised the play's humour as the culmination of Wilde's artistic career, while others were cautious about its lack of social messages. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest an enduringly popular play.\nThe successful opening night marked the climax of Wilde's career but also heralded his downfall. The Marquess of Queensberry, whose son Lord Alfred Douglas was Wilde's lover, planned to present the writer with a bouquet of rotten vegetables and disrupt the show. Wilde was tipped off, and Queensberry was refused admission. Their feud came to a climax in court when Wilde sued for libel. The proceedings provided enough evidence for his arrest, trial, and conviction on charges of 'gross indecency'. Wilde's homosexuality was revealed to the Victorian public, and he was sentenced to two years imprisonment with hard labour. Despite the play's early success, Wilde's notoriety caused it to be closed after 86 performances. After his release from prison, he published the play from exile in Paris, but he wrote no more comic or dramatic works.\nThe Importance of Being Earnest has been revived many times since its premiere. It has been adapted for the cinema on three occasions. In a 1952 film Edith Evans reprised her stage interpretation of Lady Bracknell; a 1992 version directed by Kurt Baker featured an all-black cast; and Oliver Parker's 2002 film incorporated some of Wilde's original material cut during the preparation of the first stage production.", "hasanswer": true}]}

Lensky takes Onegin to dine with the family of his fianc\u00e9e, the sociable but rather thoughtless Olga Larina. At this meeting, he also catches a glimpse of Olga's sister Tatyana. A quiet, precocious romantic, and the exact opposite of Olga, Tatyana becomes intensely drawn to Onegin. Soon after, she bares her soul to Onegin in a letter professing her love. Contrary to her expectations, Onegin does not write back. When they meet in person, he rejects her advances politely but dismissively and condescendingly. This famous speech is often referred to as Onegin's Sermon: he admits that the letter was touching, but says that he would quickly grow bored with marriage and can only offer Tatyana friendship; he coldly advises more emotional control in the future, lest another man take advantage of her innocence.\n\nLater, Lensky mischievously invites Onegin to Tatyana's name day celebration, promising a small gathering with just Tatyana, Olga, and their parents. When Onegin arrives, he finds instead a boisterous country ball, a rural parody of and contrast to the society balls of St. Petersburg of which he has grown tired. Onegin is irritated with the guests who gossip about him and Tatyana, and with Lensky for persuading him to come. He decides to avenge himself by dancing and flirting with Olga. Olga is insensitive to her fianc\u00e9 and apparently attracted to Onegin. Earnest and inexperienced, Lensky is wounded to the core and challenges Onegin to fight a duel; Onegin reluctantly accepts, feeling compelled by social convention. During the duel, Onegin unwillingly kills Lensky. Afterwards, he quits his country estate, traveling abroad to deaden his feelings of remorse.\nTatyana visits Onegin's mansion, where she looks through his books and his notes in the margins, and begins to question whether Onegin's character is merely a collage of different literary heroes, and if there is, in fact, no \"real Onegin\".

Their confrontations take them into the realms of detective investigation and science fiction, dealing with themes of time travel, historical events, and espionage.\nSince Jacobs' death, many new titles of the series have been published by other authors, mainly two separate teams of artists and writers, with the amount of these new editions significantly dwarfing Jacobs' contributions. A television series based upon the series was produced in 1997, entitled Blake and Mortimer.\nThe books by Jacobs himself are generally set in the period of their writing, but those authored by others after his death are set mostly in the 1950s and 1960s.", "hasanswer": true}]}

As a result, it has spawned many offspring. Works expanding on Wells's story include:\n\nLa Belle Valence by Th\u00e9o Varlet and Andr\u00e9 Blandin (1923) in which a squadron of World War I soldiers find the Time Machine and are transported back to the Spanish town of Valencia in the 14th century. Translated by Brian Stableford as Timeslip Troopers (2012).\nDie R\u00fcckkehr der Zeitmaschine (1946) by Egon Friedell was the first direct sequel. It dwells heavily on the technical details of the machine and the time-paradoxes it might cause when the time machine was used to visit the past. After visiting a futuristic 1995 where London is in the sky and the weather is created by companies, as well as the year 2123 where he meets two Egyptians who study history using intuition instead of actual science, the time traveller, who is given the name James MacMorton, travels to the past and ends up weeks before the time machine was built, causing it to disappear. He is forced to use the miniature version of his time machine, which already existed at that time, to send telegraphic messages through time to a friend (the author), instructing him to send him things that will allow him to build a new machine. After returning to the present, he tells his friend what happened. The 24,000-word German original was translated into English by Eddy C. Bertin in the 1940s and eventually published in paperback as The Return of the Time Machine (1972, DAW).\nThe Hertford Manuscript by Richard Cowper, first published in 1976. It features a \"manuscript\", which reports the Time Traveller's activities after the end of the original story. According to this manuscript, the Time Traveller disappeared, because his Time Machine had been damaged by the Morlocks without him knowing it. He only found out when it stopped operating during his next attempted time travel. He found himself on 27 August 1665, in London during the outbreak of the Great Plague of London. The rest of the novel is devoted to his efforts to repair the Time Machine and leave this time period before getting infected with the disease. He also has an encounter with Robert Hooke. He eventually dies of the disease on 20 September 1665. The story gives a list of subsequent owners of the manuscript until 1976. It also gives the name of the Time Traveller as Robert James Pensley, born to James and Martha Pensley in 1850 and disappearing without trace on 18 June 1894.\nThe Space Machine by Christopher Priest, first published in 1976. Because of the movement of planets, stars, and galaxies, for a time machine to stay in one spot on Earth as it travels through time, it must also follow the Earth's trajectory through space. In Priest's book, a travelling salesman damages a Time Machine similar to the original, and arrives on Mars, just before the start of the invasion described in The War of the Worlds. H.G. Wells appears as a minor character.\nMorlock Night by K. W. Jeter, first published in 1979. A steampunk fantasy novel in which the Morlocks, having studied the Traveller's machine, duplicate it and invade Victorian London. This culminates in Westminster Abbey being used as a butcher shop of human beings by the Morlocks in the 20th century, and a total disruption and collapse of the time stream. There the hero and Merlin must find \u2013 and destroy \u2013 the Time Machine, to restore the time stream and history.\nTime Machine II by George Pal and Joe Morhaim, published in 1981. The Time Traveller, named George, and the pregnant Weena try to return to his time, but instead land in the London Blitz, dying during a bombing raid. Their newborn son is rescued by an American ambulance driver and grows up in the United States under the name Christopher Jones. Sought out by the lookalike son of James Filby, Jones goes to England to collect his inheritance, leading ultimately to George's journals, and the Time Machine's original plans. He builds his own machine with 1970s upgrades and seeks his parents in the future.  Pal also worked on a detailed synopsis for a third sequel, which was partly filmed for a 1980s U.S. TV special on the making of Pal's film version of The Time Machine, using the original actors. This third sequel, the plot of which does not seem to fit with Pal's second, opens with the Time Traveller enjoying a happy life with Weena, in a future world in which the Morlocks have died out. He and his son return to save Filby in World War I.  This act changes the future, causing the nuclear war not to happen.  He and his son are thus cut off from Weena in the far future. The Time Traveller thus has to solve a dilemma \u2013 allow his friend to die, and cause the later death of millions, or give up Weena forever.\nThe Man Who Loved Morlocks (1981) and The Truth about Weena (1998) are two different sequels, the former a novel and the latter a short story, by David J. Lake. Each of them concerns the Time Traveller's return to the future. In the former, he discovers that he cannot enter any period in time he has already visited, forcing him to travel into the further future, where he finds love with a woman whose race evolved from Morlock stock. In the latter, he is accompanied by Wells and succeeds in rescuing Weena and bringing her back to the 1890s, where her political ideas cause a peaceful revolution.\nThe Time Ships, by Stephen Baxter, first published in 1995. This sequel was officially authorised by the Wells estate to mark the centenary of the original's publication. In its wide-ranging narrative, the Traveller's desire to return and rescue Weena is thwarted by the fact that he has changed history (by telling his tale to his friends, one of whom published the account). With a Morlock (in the new history, the Morlocks are intelligent and cultured), he travels through the multiverse as increasingly complicated timelines unravel around him, eventually meeting mankind's far future descendants, whose ambition is to travel back to the birth of the universe, and modify the way the multiverse will unfold. This sequel includes many nods to the prehistory of Wells's story in the names of characters and chapters.\nIn \"The Richmond Enigma\" by John DeChancie, Sherlock Holmes investigates the disappearance of the Time Traveller, a contemporary and, in this story, a distant relative. The intervention of Holmes and Watson succeeds in calling back the missing Time Traveller, who has resolved to prevent the time machine's existence, out of concern for the danger it could make possible. The story appeared in Sherlock Holmes in Orbit (1995)\nThe Steam Man of the Prairie and the Dark Rider Get Down: A Dime Novel by Joe R. Lansdale, first published in The Long Ones (1999). In this story, the Time Traveller accidentally damages the space-time continuum and is transformed into the vampire-like Dark Rider.\nThe 2003 short story \"On the Surface\" by Robert J. Sawyer begins with this quote from the Wells original: \"I have suspected since that the Morlocks had even partially taken it [the time machine] to pieces while trying in their dim way to grasp its purpose.\" In the Sawyer story, the Morlocks develop a fleet of time machines and use them to conquer the same far future Wells depicted at the end of the original, by which time, because the sun has grown red and dim and thus no longer blinds them, they can reclaim the surface of the world.\nThe Time Traveller and his machine appear in the story Allan and the Sundered Veil by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill, which acts as a prequel to The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume One. The Time Traveller shares an adventure with fellow literary icons Allan Quatermain, John Carter, and Randolph Carter.\nDavid Haden's novelette The Time Machine: A Sequel (2010) is a direct sequel, picking up where the original finished. The Time Traveller goes back to rescue Weena but finds the Eloi less simple than he first imagined, and time travel far more complicated.\nSimon Baxter's novel The British Empire: Psychic Battalions Against the Morlocks (2010) imagines a steampunk/cyberpunk future in which the British Empire has remained the dominant world force until the Morlocks arrive from the future.\nHal Colebatch's Time-Machine Troopers (2011) (Acashic Publishers) is twice the length of the original. In it, the Time Traveller returns to the future world about 18 years after the time he escaped from the Morlocks, taking with him Robert Baden-Powell, the real-world founder of the Boy Scout movement. They set out to teach the Eloi self-reliance and self-defence against the Morlocks, but the Morlocks capture them. H.G. Wells and Winston Churchill are also featured as characters.\nPaul Schullery's The Time Traveller's Tale: Chronicle of a Morlock Captivity (2012) continues the story in the voice and manner of the original Wells book. After many years' absence, the Time Traveller returns and describes his further adventures. His attempts to mobilize the Eloi in their own defense against the Morlocks failed when he was captured by the Morlocks. Much of the book is occupied with his deeply unsettling discoveries about the Morlock / Eloi symbiosis, his gradual assimilation into Morlock society, and his ultimately successful attempt to discover the true cause of humanity's catastrophic transformation into two such tragic races.\nThe Great Illustrated Classics in 1992 published an adaptation of Wells's novella that adds an extra destination to the Time Traveller's adventure: Stopping in 2200 AD on his way back home, he becomes caught up in a civil war between factions of a technocratic society that was established to avert ecological catastrophe.\nBeyond the Time Machine by Burt Libe (2002). The first of two Time Machine sequels written by US writer Burt Libe, it continues the story of the Time Traveller: where he finally settles down, including his rescue of Weena and his subsequent family with her. Highlighted are exploits of his daughters Narra and her younger sister Belinda; coping with their 33rd-Century existence; considering their unusual past and far-Future heritage. Doing some time travelling of their own, the daughters revisit 802,701 AD, discovering that the so-called dual-specie Eloi and Morlock inhabitants actually are far more complex and complicated than their father's initial appraisal.\nTangles in Time by Burt Libe (2005). The second of two Time Machine sequels written by American writer Burt Libe, it continues the story of younger daughter Belinda, now grown at age 22. Her father (the original Time Traveller) has just died from old age, and she and Weena (her mother) now must decide what to do with the rest of their lives. Weena makes a very unusual decision, leaving Belinda to search for her own place in time. Also, with further time travel, she locates her two long-lost brothers, previously thought to be dead; she also meets and rescues a young man from the far future, finding herself involved in a very confusing relationship.\nEpilogue: Time Machine Chronicles is a 2010 sequel by Jaime V.

The \"single most important source used by Geoffrey of Monmouth in his pseudohistorical Historia Regum Britanniae\" and through the enormous popularity of the latter work, this version of the early history of Britain, including the Trojan origin tradition, was incorporated into subsequent chronicles of the long-running history of the land, such as the Middle English Brut of England, also known as The Chronicles of England.\nThe work was the first source to portray King Arthur, who is described as a dux bellorum ('military leader') or miles ('warrior, soldier') and not as a king. It names the twelve battles that Arthur fought, but, unlike the Annales Cambriae, does not give any actual dates.\nThe reference in the Historia Brittonum to Arthur carrying the image of St. Mary on his shoulders in a battle has been interpreted by later commentators as a mistranslation of Arthur bearing the image of Mary on his shield; the words in Welsh are very similar.The 19th-century classicist Theodor Mommsen divided the work into seven parts: Preface (Prefatio Nennii Britonum); I. The Six Ages of the World (de sex aetatibus mundi) (\u00a71-6); II. History of the Britons (historia Brittonum) (\u00a77-49); III. Life of Patrick (vita Patricii) (\u00a750-55); IV.

Wonders of Britain (de mirabilibus Britanniae) (\u00a767\u201476).\nThe Historia Brittonum can be dated to about 829. The work was written no earlier than the \"fourth year of [the reign of] king Mermenus\" (who has been identified as Merfyn Frych ap Gwriad, king of Gwynedd). Historians have conservatively assigned 828 to the earliest date for the work, which is consistent with the statement in chapter 4 that \"from the Passion of Christ 796 years have passed. But from his Incarnation are 831 years\".The text makes use of two narrative techniques that are generally considered not reliable by modern academic standards: synthesizing and synchronizing history. Synthetic history combines legendary elements with fact, which makes the veracity of the text challenging to evaluate. Various specious causal connections and attempts to synchronize material from different sources and traditions also contribute to undermining the reliability of the chronicle.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Augustine refers to Apuleius and The Golden Ass particularly derisively in The City of God.\nThe writing of William Shakespeare was influenced by The Golden Ass e.g. A Midsummer Night's Dream from c. 1595 where the character Bottom's head is transformed to that of an ass.In 1517, Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli wrote his own version of the story, as a terza rima poem. It was uncompleted at the time of his death.In 1708, Charles Gildon published an adaptation of The Golden Ass, titled The New Metamorphosis. A year later in 1709, he published a re-adaptation, titled The Golden Spy, which is regarded as the first, fully-fledged it-narrative in English.In 1821, Charles Nodier published \"Smarra ou les Demons de la Nuit\" influenced by a reading of Apuleius.\nIn 1883, Carlo Collodi published The Adventures of Pinocchio which includes an episode in which the puppet protagonist is transformed into an ass. Another character who is transformed alongside him is named Lucignolo (Candlewick or Lampwick), a possible allusion to Lucius. The episode is frequently featured in its subsequent adaptations.\nIn 1915, Franz Kafka published the short story The Metamorphosis under a quite similar name, about a young man's unexpected transformation into an \"Ungeziefer\", a verminous bug.\nIn 1956, C.

Empress Dowager Wu, in response, sent the general Li Xiaoyi (\u674e\u5b5d\u9038), assisted by the generals Li Zhishi (\u674e\u77e5\u5341) and Ma Jingchen (\u99ac\u656c\u81e3) to suppress Li Jianye's rebellion, and Li Xiaoyi quickly did so. Meanwhile, believing the chancellor Pei Yan to be undermining her authority, she executed Pei under accusation of treason and demoted a large number of officials and generals who dared to speak in Pei's defense, later executing some of them.\nIn 686, Empress Dowager created a number of bronze boxes designed to encourage secret reports of crimes. She also began to retain a group of secret police officials to carry out torture and interrogation of people suspected of opposing her rule, including Suo Yuanli, Zhou Xing, and Lai Junchen. On one occasion, she offered to return imperial authorities to Emperor Ruizong, but Emperor Ruizong knew that she was not actually intending to do so, and therefore declined.  She thereafter resumed exercising imperial powers.\nEmperor Ruizong had completely stayed out of political matters during these years, but he made an exception in 687 when Empress Dowager Wu believed the chancellor Liu Yizhi, who had previously served on his staff when he was a prince, whom she had trusted and promoted, to have turned against her in favoring that she return imperial authorities to Emperor Ruizong. She had Liu accused of corruption and arrested, and Emperor Ruizong personally wrote a petition to request her to spare Liu\u2014which, however, as Liu observed, had the opposite effect, and she ordered Liu to commit suicide.\nIn 688, fearing that Empress Dowager Wu was using a ceremony to worship the god of the Luo River (\u6d1b\u6c34, flowing near Luoyang) as an excuse to summon them to Luoyang to slaughter them, the imperial princes considered rebellion, and one was launched by Emperor Ruizong's uncle Li Zhen the Prince of Yue and Li Zhen's son Li Chong the Prince of Langye, claiming that Emperor Ruizong was under arrest and needed to be rescued. However, both Li Zhen and Li Chong were quickly defeated; Li Chong was killed in battle, while Li Zhen committed suicide. Empress Dowager Wu used this opportunity to carry out a major purge of senior imperial Li clan members, including Emperor Ruizong's granduncles Li Yuanjia (\u674e\u5143\u5609) the Prince of Han and Li Lingkui (\u674e\u9748\u5914) the Prince of Lu.\nIn 690, Empress Dowager Wu received a number of petitions that she take the throne herself, and Emperor Ruizong also submitted such a petition.

Eclogue 10 has verbal echoes with all the earlier poems. Thomas K. Hubbard (1998) has noted, \"The first half of the book has often been seen as a positive construction of a pastoral vision, whilst the second half dramatizes progressive alienation from that vision, as each poem of the first half is taken up and responded to in reverse order.\"However, the arrangement of the eclogues into three groups of three does not prevent the collection also being seen as divided at the same time into two halves, with a second opening at the beginning of eclogue 6.The average length of each eclogue is 83 lines, but some are a little longer and some shorter.

Cabell's tomb survives in the town of Buckfastleigh.Cabell lived for hunting, and was what in those days was described as a \"monstrously evil man\". He gained this reputation, amongst other things, for immorality and having sold his soul to the Devil. There was also a rumour that he had murdered his wife, Elizabeth Fowell, a daughter of Sir Edmund Fowell, 1st Baronet (1593\u20131674), of Fowelscombe. On 5 July 1677, he died and was buried in the sepulchre. The night of his interment saw a phantom pack of hounds come baying across the moor to howl at his tomb. From that night on, he could be found leading the phantom pack across the moor, usually on the anniversary of his death. If the pack were not out hunting, they could be found ranging around his grave howling and shrieking. To try to lay the soul to rest, the villagers built a large building around the tomb, and to be doubly sure a huge slab was placed over the top.Moreover, Devon's folklore includes tales of a fearsome supernatural dog known as the Yeth hound that Conan Doyle may have heard. Weller (2002) believes that Baskerville Hall is based on one of three possible houses on or near Dartmoor: Fowelscombe in the parish of Ugborough, the seat of the Fowell Baronets; Hayford Hall, near Buckfastleigh (also owned by John King (d.1861) of Fowelscombe) and Brook Hall, in the parish of Buckfastleigh, about two miles east of Hayford, the actual home of Richard Cabell. It has also been claimed that Baskerville Hall is based on a property in Mid Wales, built in 1839 by one Thomas Mynors Baskerville. The house was formerly named Clyro Court and was renamed Baskerville Hall towards the end of the 19th century. Arthur Conan Doyle was apparently a family friend who often stayed there and may have been aware of a local legend of the hound of the Baskervilles.Still other tales claim that Conan Doyle was inspired by a holiday in North Norfolk, where the tale of Black Shuck is well known. The pre-Gothic Cromer Hall, where Conan Doyle stayed, also closely resembles Doyle's vivid descriptions of Baskerville Hall.James Lynam Molloy, a friend of Doyle's, and author of \"Love's Old Sweet Song\", married Florence Baskerville, daughter of Henry Baskerville of Crowsley Park, Oxfordshire.

Pullman said of Donohue's call for a boycott, \"Why don't we trust readers? [...] Oh, it causes me to shake my head with sorrow that such nitwits could be loose in the world\".In a November 2002 interview, Pullman was asked to respond to the Catholic Herald  calling his books \"the stuff of nightmares\" and \"worthy of the bonfire\". He replied: \"My response to that was to ask the publishers to print it in the next book, which they did! I think it's comical, it's just laughable\". The original remark in Catholic Herald (which was \"there are numerous candidates that seem to me to be far more worthy of the bonfire than Harry Potter\") was written in the context of parents in South Carolina pressing their Board of Education to ban the Harry Potter books.Pullman expressed surprise over what he considered to be a relatively low level of criticism for His Dark Materials on religious grounds, saying \"I've been surprised by how little criticism I've got. Harry Potter's been taking all the flak... Meanwhile, I've been flying under the radar, saying things that are far more subversive than anything poor old Harry has said. My books are about killing God\". Others support this interpretation, arguing that the series, while clearly anticlerical, is also anti-theological because the death of God is represented as a fundamentally unimportant question.Pullman found support from some other Christians, most notably from Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury (spiritual head of the Anglican Communion), who argued that Pullman's attacks focus on the constraints and dangers of dogmatism and the use of religion to oppress, not on Christianity itself. Williams also recommended the His Dark Materials series of books for inclusion and discussion in Religious Education classes, and stated that \"To see large school-parties in the audience of the Pullman plays at the National Theatre is vastly encouraging\".

It is regarded as one of the greatest Classic Chinese Novels, and has been described as arguably the most popular literary work in East Asia. Arthur Waley's 1942 abridged translation, Monkey, is known in English-speaking countries.\nThe novel is an extended account of the legendary pilgrimage of the Tang dynasty Buddhist monk Xuanzang, who traveled to the \"Western Regions\" (Central Asia and India) to obtain Buddhist s\u016btras (sacred texts) and returned after many trials and much suffering. The monk is referred to as Tang Sanzang in the novel. The novel retains the broad outline of Xuanzang's own account, Great Tang Records on the Western Regions, but adds elements from folk tales and the author's invention: Gautama Buddha gives this task to the monk and provides him with three protectors who agree to help him as an atonement for their sins. These disciples are the Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, and Sha Wujing, together with a dragon prince who acts as Tang Sanzang's steed, a white horse. The group of pilgrims journey towards enlightenment by the power and virtue of cooperation.\nJourney to the West has strong roots in Chinese folk religion, Chinese mythology, Chinese Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoist and Buddhist folklore, and the pantheon of Taoist immortals and Buddhist bodhisattvas are still reflective of certain Chinese religious attitudes today, while being the inspiration of many modern manhwa, manhua, manga and anime series.

The book was initially intended to be a serious travel guide, with accounts of local history along the route, but the humorous elements took over to the point where the serious and somewhat sentimental passages seem a distraction to the comic novel.

The dog, Montmorency, is entirely fictional but, \"as Jerome admits, developed out of that area of inner consciousness which, in all Englishmen, contains an element of the dog\".

Et in Arcadia ego, the Latin phrase which is the title of the major section (Book One) of Brideshead Revisited, is also a central theme to Tom Stoppard's play. Stoppard's phrase may have been inspired by the 1980s BBC comedy series Three of a Kind, starring Tracey Ullman, Lenny Henry and David Copperfield, which featured a recurring sketch entitled \"Brideshead Regurgitated\", with Henry in the role of Charles Ryder.\nIn the early 1980s, following the release of the television series, the Australian Broadcasting Commission (from 1983, Australian Broadcasting Corporation) produced a radio show called Brunswick Heads Revisited. Brunswick Heads is a coastal town in northern New South Wales. The series was a spoof, and made fun of the 'Englishness' of Brideshead and many amusing parallels could be drawn between the upper class characters from Brideshead and their opposite numbers from rural Australia.\nPaula Byrne's biography of Evelyn Waugh, titled Mad World: Evelyn Waugh and the Secrets of Brideshead, was published by HarperPress in the UK in August 2009 and HarperCollins New York in the US in April 2010. An excerpt was published in the Sunday Times 9 August 2009 under the headline \"Sex Scandal Behind 'Brideshead Revisited'\". The book concerns the 7th Earl of Beauchamp, who was the father of Waugh's friend Hugh Lygon. It states that the exiled Lord Marchmain is a version of Lord Beauchamp and Lady Marchmain of Lady Beauchamp, that the dissolute Lord Sebastian Flyte was modelled after Hugh Lygon and Lady Julia Flyte after Lady Mary Lygon. The book, which Byrne describes in the preface as a \"partial life\", identifies other real-life bases for events and characters in Waugh's novel, though Byrne argues carefully against simple one-to-one correspondences, suggesting instead that Waugh combined people, places and events into composite inventions, subtle transmutations of life into fiction.

{"id": "50_527", "question": "Who is the author of The Monk?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_20736", "text": "In the same month as the second edition was published, Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote a piece in The Critical Review, an important literary magazine of the day, in which he both praises and harshly criticises the novel. He acknowledges that it is \"the offspring of no common genius,\" that the \"underplot... is skilfully and closely connected with the main story, and is subservient to its development,\" that the story Lewis weaves in about the bleeding nun is \"truly terrific\" and that he cannot recall a \"bolder or more happy conception than that of the burning cross on the forehead of the wandering Jew.\" Coleridge gives his highest praise to the character of Matilda, who he believes is \"the author's master-piece. It is, indeed, exquisitely imagined, and as exquisitely supported. The whole work is distinguished by the variety and impressiveness of its incidents; and the author everywhere discovers an imagination rich, powerful, and fervid. Such are the excellencies\" (7). Coleridge continues by saying that \"the errors and defects are more numerous, and (we are sorry to add) of greater importance.\" Because \"the order of nature may be changed whenever the author's purposes demand it\" there are no surprises in the work. Moral truth cannot be gleaned because Ambrosio was destroyed by spiritual beings, and no earthly being can sufficiently oppose the \"power and cunning of supernatural beings.\" Scenes of grotesquery and horror abound, which are a proof of \"a low and vulgar taste.\" The character of Ambrosio is \"impossible... contrary to nature.\" Coleridge argues that the most \"grievous fault... for which no literary excellence can atone\" is that \"our author has contrived to make [tales of enchantments and witchcraft] ' \u2018pernicious' \u2018, by blending, with an irreverent negligence, all that is most awfully true in religion with all that is most ridiculously absurd in superstition,\" commenting with the immortal line that \"the Monk is a romance, which if a parent saw in the hands of a son or daughter, he might reasonably turn pale.\" Coleridge finishes the piece by explaining that he was \"induced to pay particular attention to this work, from the unusual success which it has experienced\" and that \"the author is a man of rank and fortune. Yes! the author of the Monk signs himself a LEGISLATOR! We stare and tremble.\"Thomas James Mathias followed Coleridge's lead in The Pursuits of Literature, a poem in the 18th-Century satiric tradition, but takes a step farther than Coleridge by claiming that a specific passage made the novel indictable under law. The passage, found in Chapter Seven Volume II, discusses an interpretation of the Bible as too lewd for youth to read.\nThese two major pieces led the way for a multitude of other attacks on the novel, from such sources as the Monthly Review, the Monthly Magazine, and the Scots Magazine; the last of these attacked the novel six years after its publication. It was a general trend amongst those who criticised, however, to offer praise of some aspect of the novel. \"It looked,\" writes Andr\u00e9 Parreaux, \"as if every reviewer or critic of the book, no matter how hostile he was, felt compelled to at least pay lip-service to Lewis's genius.\"The criticism of his novel, extending even into criticism of his person, never truly left Lewis, and an attack on his character was published by the Courier posthumously, calling itself a \"just estimate of his character.\" As recorded by MacDonald:  \u201cHe had devoted the first fruits of his mind to the propagation of evil, and the whole long harvest was burnt up ... There is a moral in the life of this man ... He was a reckless defiler of the public mind; a profligate, he cared not how many were to be undone when he drew back the curtain of his profligacy; he had infected his reason with the insolent belief that the power to corrupt made the right, and that conscience might be laughed, so long as he could evade law. The Monk was an eloquent evil; but the man who compounded it knew in his soul that he was compounding poison for the multitude, and in that knowledge he sent it into the world.\u201dThere were those who defended The Monk as well. Joseph Bell, publisher of the novel, spent half of his essay Impartial Strictures on the Poem Called \u201cThe Pursuits of Literature\u201d and Particularly a Vindication of the Romance of \u201cThe Monk\u201d defending Lewis; Thomas Dutton, in his Literary Census:  A Satirical Poem, retaliated against Mathias and praised Lewis; Henry Francis Robert Soame compared Lewis to Dante in his The Epistle in Rhyme to M. G. Lewis, Esq. M. P.\u201cAssurances that The Monk was not as dangerous as its enemies maintained failed to dampen its success with the reading public,\u201d writes Peck. \u201cThey had been told that the book was horrible, blasphemous, and lewd, and they rushed to put their morality to the test.\u201d Indeed, the novel's popularity continued to rise and by 1800 there were five London and two Dublin editions.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Despite its slow beginnings, later critics have praised it as an American classic that explores natural simplicity, harmony, and beauty. The American poet Robert Frost wrote of Thoreau, \"In one book ... he surpasses everything we have had in America\".It is often assumed that critics initially ignored Walden, and that those who reviewed the book were evenly split or slightly more negative than positive in their assessment of it. But, researchers have shown that Walden actually was \"more favorably and widely received by Thoreau's contemporaries than hitherto suspected\". Of the 66 initial reviews that have been found so far, 46 \"were strongly favorable\". Some reviews were rather superficial, merely recommending the book or predicting its success with the public; others were more lengthy, detailed, and nuanced with both positive and negative comments. Positive comments included praise for Thoreau's independence, practicality, wisdom, \"manly simplicity\", and fearlessness. Less than three weeks after the book's publication, Thoreau's mentor Ralph Waldo Emerson proclaimed, \"All American kind are delighted with Walden as far as they have dared to say.\"On the other hand, the terms \"quaint\" or \"eccentric\" appeared in over half of the book's initial reviews. Other terms critical of Thoreau included selfish, strange, impractical, privileged (or \"manor born\"), and misanthropic. One review compared and contrasted Thoreau's form of living to communism, probably not in the sense of Marxism, but instead of communal living or religious communism. While valuing freedom from possessions, Thoreau was not communal in the sense of practicing sharing or of embracing community. So, communism \"is better than our hermit's method of getting rid of encumbrance\".In contrast to Thoreau's \"manly simplicity\", nearly twenty years after Thoreau's death Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson judged Thoreau's endorsement of living alone in natural simplicity, apart from modern society, to be a mark of effeminacy, calling it \"womanish solicitude; for there is something unmanly, something almost dastardly\" about the lifestyle. Poet John Greenleaf Whittier criticized what he perceived as the message in Walden that man should lower himself to the level of a woodchuck and walk on four legs. He said: \"Thoreau's Walden is a capital reading, but very wicked and heathenish ... After all, for me, I prefer walking on two legs\". Author Edward Abbey criticized Thoreau's ideas and experiences at Walden in detail throughout his response to Walden called \"Down the River with Thoreau\", written in 1980.Today, despite these criticisms, Walden stands as one of America's most celebrated works of literature. John Updike wrote of Walden, \"A century and a half after its publication, Walden has become such a totem of the back-to-nature, preservationist, anti-business, civil-disobedience mindset, and Thoreau so vivid a protester, so perfect a crank and hermit saint, that the book risks being as revered and unread as the Bible.\" The American psychologist B. F. Skinner wrote that he carried a copy of Walden with him in his youth, and eventually wrote Walden Two in 1945, a fictional utopia about 1,000 members who live together in a Thoreau-inspired community.Kathryn Schulz has accused Thoreau of hypocrisy, misanthropy and being sanctimonious based on his writings in Walden, although this criticism has been perceived as highly selective.", "hasanswer": false}]}

One of these was Patanjali's Yogasutras. His translation included the text and a thitherto unknown Sanskrit commentary. Al Biruni's translation preserved many of the core themes of Yoga philosophy of Hinduism, but certain sutras and analytical commentaries were restated making it more consistent with Islamic monotheistic theology. Al Biruni's version of Yoga Sutras reached Persia and Arabian peninsula by about 1050 AD.\nThe Yoga Sutras of Patanjali was translated into Old Javanese by Indonesian Hindus, and the text was called Dharma Patanjala.

Foucault used the term \"fascism\" to refer \"not only historical fascism, the fascism of Hitler and Mussolini...but also the fascism in us all, in our heads and in our everyday behavior, the fascism that causes us to love power, to desire the very thing that dominates and exploits us.\" Foucault added that Anti-Oedipus is \"a book of ethics, the first book of ethics to be written in France in quite a long time\", and suggested that this explains its popular success. Foucault proposed that the book could be called Introduction to the Non-Fascist Life. Foucault argued that putting the principles espoused in Anti-Oedipus into practice involves freeing political action from \"unitary and totalizing paranoia\" and withdrawing allegiance \"from the old categories of the Negative (law, limit, castration, lack, lacuna), which western thought has so long held sacred as a form of power and an access to reality.\"The psychiatrist David Cooper described Anti-Oedipus as \"a magnificent vision of madness as a revolutionary force\", crediting its authors with using \"the psychoanalytic language and the discourse of Saussure (and his successors)\" to pit \"linguistics against itself in what is already proving to be an historic act of depassment.\" The critic Frederick Crews wrote that when Deleuze and Guattari \"indicted Lacanian psychoanalysis as a capitalist disorder\" and \"pilloried analysts as the most sinister priest-manipulators of a psychotic society\", their \"demonstration was widely regarded as unanswerable\" and \"devastated the already shrinking Lacanian camp in Paris.\" The philosopher Douglas Kellner described Anti-Oedipus as its era's publishing sensation, and, along with Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard's Libidinal Economy (1974), a key text in \"the micropolitics of desire.\" The psychoanalyst Joel Kovel wrote that Deleuze and Guattari provided a definitive challenge to the mystique of the family, but that they did so in the spirit of nihilism, commenting, \"Immersion in their world of 'schizoculture' and desiring machines is enough to make a person yearn for the secure madness of the nuclear family.\"Anthony Elliott described Anti-Oedipus as a \"celebrated\" work that \"scandalized French psychoanalysis and generated heated dispute among intellectuals\" and \"offered a timely critique of psychoanalysis and Lacanianism at the time of its publication in France\". However, he added that most commentators would now agree that \"schizoanalysis\" is fatally flawed, and that there are several major objections that can be made against Anti-Oedipus. In his view, even if \"subjectivity may be usefully decentred and deconstructed\", it is wrong to assume that \"desire is naturally rebellious and subversive.\" He believed that Deleuze and Guattari see the individual as \"no more than various organs, intensities and flows, rather than a complex, contradictory identity\" and make false emancipatory claims for schizophrenia. He also argued that Deleuze and Guattari's work produces difficulties for the interpretation of contemporary culture, because of their \"rejection of institutionality as such\", which obscures the difference between liberal democracy and fascism and leaves Deleuze and Guattari with \"little more than a romantic, idealized fantasy of the 'schizoid hero'\". He wrote that Anti-Oedipus follows a similar theoretical direction to Lyotard's Libidinal Economy, though he sees several significant differences between Deleuze and Guattari on the one hand and Lyotard on the other.Some of Guattari's diary entries, correspondence with Deleuze, and notes on the development of the book were published posthumously as The Anti-Oedipus Papers (2004). The philosopher Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen and the psychologist Sonu Shamdasani wrote that rather than having their confidence shaken by the \"provocations and magnificent rhetorical violence\" of Anti-Oedipus, the psychoanalytic profession felt that the debates raised by the book legitimated their discipline. Joshua Ramey wrote that while the passage into Deleuze and Guattari's \"body without organs\" is \"fraught with danger and even pain ... the point of Anti-Oedipus is not to make glamorous that violence or that suffering. Rather, the point is to show that there is a viable level of Dinoysian [sic] experience.\" The philosopher Alan D.

In a sumo tournament, all wrestlers in the top division compete in 15 matches and face demotion if they do not win at least eight of them. The sumo community is very close-knit, and the wrestlers at the top levels tend to know each other well. The authors looked at the final match, and considered the case of a wrestler with seven wins, seven losses, and one fight to go, fighting against an 8\u20136 wrestler. Statistically, the 7\u20137 wrestler should have a slightly below even chance, since the 8\u20136 wrestler is slightly better. However, the 7\u20137 wrestler actually wins around 80% of the time. Levitt uses this statistic and other data gleaned from sumo wrestling matches, along with the effect that allegations of corruption have on match results, to conclude that those who already have eight wins collude with those who are 7\u20137 and let them win, since they have already secured their position for the following tournament. Despite condemnation of the claims by the Japan Sumo Association following the book's publication in 2005, the 2011 Grand Tournament in Tokyo was canceled for the first time since 1946 because of allegations of match-fixing.The authors attempt to demonstrate the power of data mining, as a number of their results emerge from Levitt's analysis of various databases. The authors posit that various incentives encourage teachers to cheat by assisting their students with multiple-choice high-stakes tests. Such cheating in the Chicago school system is inferred from detailed analysis of students' answers to multiple-choice questions. Levitt asks, \"What would the pattern of answers look like if the teacher cheated?\", and hypothesizes that the more difficult questions found at the end of test sections will be answered correctly more frequently than the easy questions at the beginning of test sections.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Keynes thus denied that full employment was the natural result of competitive markets in equilibrium.\nIn this he challenged the conventional ('classical') economic wisdom of his day.

{"id": "50_549", "question": "Who is the author of \"Emma\"?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_20844", "text": "Prior to publishing, John Murray's reader, William Gifford, who was also the editor of the Quarterly Review, said of the novel that \"Of Emma I have nothing but good to say. I was sure of the writer before you mentioned her. The MS though plainly written has yet some, indeed many little omissions, and an expression may now and then be amended in passing through the press. I will readily undertake the revision.\" Early reviews of Emma were generally favourable, and were more numerous than those of any other of Austen's novels. One important review, requested by John Murray prior to publication and written by Sir Walter Scott, appeared anonymously in March 1816 in the Quarterly Review, although the date of the journal was October 1815. He writes:The author is already known to the public by the two novels announced in her title page, and both, the last especially, attracted, with justice, an attention from the public far superior to what is granted to the ephemeral productions which supply the regular demand of watering- places and circulating libraries. They belong to a class of fictions which has arisen almost in our own times, and which draws the characters and incidents introduced more immediately from the current of ordinary life than was permitted by the former rules of the novel...Emma has even less story than either of the preceding novels...The author's knowledge of the world, and the peculiar tact with which she presents characters that the reader cannot fail to recognize, reminds us something of the merits of the Flemish school of painting. The subjects are not often elegant, and certainly never grand: but they are finished up to nature, and with a precision which delights the reader.Two other unsigned reviews appeared in 1816, one in The Champion, also in March, and another in September of the same year in Gentleman's Magazine.  Other commenters include Thomas Moore, the Irish poet, singer and entertainer who was a contemporary of Austen's; he wrote to Samuel Rogers, an English poet, in 1816:\"Let me entreat you to read Emma \u2013 it is the very perfection of novel-writing \u2013 and I cannot praise it more highly than by saying it is often extremely like your own method of describing things \u2013 so much effect with so little effort!\"\nA contemporary Scottish novelist, Susan Edmonstone Ferrier, wrote to a friend, also in 1816:\"I have been reading Emma, which is excellent; there is no story whatever, and the heroine is not better than other people; but the characters are all true to life and the style so piquant, that it does not require the adventitious aids of mystery and adventure.\"\nThere was some criticism about the lack of story. John Murray remarked that it lacked \"incident and Romance\"; Maria Edgeworth, the author of Belinda, to whom Austen had sent a complimentary copy, wrote:there was no story in it, except that Miss Emma found that the man whom she designed for Harriet's lover was an admirer of her own \u2013 & he was affronted at being refused by Emma & Harriet wore the willow \u2013 and smooth, thin water-gruel is according to Emma's father's opinion a very good thing & it is very difficult to make a cook understand what you mean by smooth, thin water-gruel!!\nAusten also collected comments from friends and family on their opinions of Emma. Writing several years later, John Henry Newman observed in a letter about the novel:Everything Miss Austen writes is clever, but I desiderate something. There is a want of body to the story.  The action is frittered away in over-little things.  There are some beautiful things in it. Emma herself is the most interesting to me of all her heroines. I feel kind to her whenever I think of her...That other women, Fairfax, is a dolt- but I like Emma.\nLater reviewers or commenters on the novel include Charlotte Bront\u00eb, George Henry Lewes, Juliet Pollock, Anne Ritchie, Henry James, Reginald Farrer, Virginia Woolf, and E. M. Forster. Other reviewers include Thomas Babington Macaulay who considered Austen to be a \"Prose Shakespeare\", and Margaret Oliphant who stated in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine in March that she prefers Emma to Austen's other works and that it is \"the work of her mature mind\". Although Austen's Pride and Prejudice is the most popular of her novels, Robert McCrum suggests that Emma \"is her masterpiece, mixing the sparkle of her early books with a deep sensibility\". Additionally, academic John Mullan argued that Emma was a revolutionary novel which changed the shape of what is possible in fiction\" because it \"bent narration through the distorting lens of its protagonist\u2019s mind\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

The earliest film version was Fox's 1921 silent version. In 1927, the novel was adapted into the musical A Connecticut Yankee by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. A 1931 film, also called A Connecticut Yankee, starred Will Rogers. The story was adapted as an hour-long radio play on the October 5, 1947, broadcast of the Ford Theatre, starring Karl Swenson. A 1949 musical film featured Bing Crosby and Rhonda Fleming, with music by Jimmy Van Heusen and Victor Young. In 1960, Tennessee Ernie Ford starred in a television adaptation. In 1970, the book was adapted into a 74-minute animated TV special directed by Zoran Janjic with Orson Bean as the voice of the title character. In 1978 an episode of Once Upon a Classic, \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\", was an adaptation, which starred Paul Rudd and Tovah Feldshuh, with Richard Basehart as Arthur and Roscoe Lee Browne as Merlin. This episode was released as though a feature on VHS and laserdisc by MasterVision in 1987 with the cover title, Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee..., and later as a double feature DVD with The Amazing Mr. Blunden. The DVD version, released by budget label East West DVD at a suggested retail price of $1, lacks the series intro and Bill Bixby's introduction. Also in 1979 was the Disney film Unidentified Flying Oddball, also known as A Spaceman in King Arthur's Court. The TV series The Transformers had a second-season episode, \"A Decepticon Raider in King Arthur's Court\", that had a group of Autobots and Decepticons sent back to the Middle Ages. In 1988, the Soviet variation called New Adventures of a Yankee in King Arthur's Court appeared. More recently it was adapted into a 1989 television film by Paul Zindel which starred Keshia Knight Pulliam and Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois. In 1987, Disney even paid homage to the story in a first-season episode of DuckTales (\"Sir Gyro de Gearloose\"), in which Gyro builds a time machine and flees the modern age for the time of King Arthur, taking Huey, Dewey and Louie along for the adventure.\nIt has also inspired many variations and parodies, such as the 1979 Bugs Bunny special A Connecticut Rabbit in King Arthur's Court. A Knight for a Day is a 1946 Disney short film starring Goofy that is loosely inspired by the novel. In 1995, Walt Disney Studios adapted the book into the feature film A Kid in King Arthur's Court. Also in 1995, Philippe Ross played a transported high-schooler in A Young Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, with Michael York as Merlin. A 1992 cartoon series, King Arthur & the Knights of Justice, could also be seen as deriving inspiration from the novel. Terry Pratchett's 1995 short story \"Once and Future\" tells a similar story of a time-traveller, Mervin, stranded in a pre-Arthurian \"Avalon\", who refers to himself as being like \"the Connecticut Yankee\". In 1998 Disney made another adaption with Whoopi Goldberg in A Knight in Camelot.\nSeveral independent films produced during the 1990s drew inspiration from the novel, such as Army of Darkness (1992) and the fourth and fifth entries in the Trancers series. The 2001 film Black Knight similarly transports a modern-day American to Medieval England (but not in the time of King Arthur but in the year 1328), while adding a racial element to the time-traveller plot line.\nIn the Carl Sagan novel Contact, the protagonist, Eleanor Arroway, is reading A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, specifically the scene where Hank first approaches Camelot, when she finds out about her father's death. The quotation \"'Bridgeport?' Said I. 'Camelot,' Said he\" is also used later in the book, and the story is used as a metaphor for contact between civilizations at very different levels of technological and ethical advancement.Yankee has also greatly influenced the premier Soviet sci-fi writers, Strugatsky Brothers, and their two seminal books.  In humorous Monday Begins on Saturday Merlin's character is taken entirely from the Mark Twain's book, and he often references it.  Hard to Be a God is essentially a remake of Yankee, concentrating on the moral and ethical questions of \"civilizing the uncivilized.\"  Its ending is almost identical to Yankee:  both main protagonists crumble under the weight of dead bodies of those they tried to civilize.\nThe fifth season of TV series Once Upon a Time features Hank Morgan.  He is introduced in the episode \"Dreamcatcher\" as Sir Morgan, a widower with a teenaged daughter, Violet, living in a Camelot that exists in a magical reality.  Violet becomes a love interest for main character Henry Mills.  Morgan does not appear on screen again, but is mentioned in later episodes.  He and Violet, along with other Camelot residents, are transported to Storybrooke in the \"real\" world.  When most of Arthur's court returns to Camelot, Violet informs Henry that she and her father will stay in Storybrooke, as her father is originally from Connecticut in the same world.  A tie-in novel, Henry and Violet, confirms other details consistent with Twain's novel, such as Hank leaving Connecticut in the year 1889.\nIn the Chronicles of the Imaginarium Geographica series by James A. Owen, Hank appears in several books as a time-travelling \"Messenger\" recruited by Mark Twain. Hank is able to travel through time and space at will using an enchanted pocketwatch, which eventually suffers a malfunction that strands him in the time stream. (Sandy and Hello-Central are not mentioned in the series.)\nThe television series MacGyver includes a two-part adaptation (\"Good Knight MacGyver\", season 7, episodes 7 & 8, 1991) in which a modern-day engineer is transported to Arthur's court, where he uses his \"magic\" (science) to assist Merlin and save the king from a deadly plot. After over six seasons on the air, the second part is the only episode to ever reveal MacGyver's first name.", "hasanswer": false}]}

These emotions center on Roderick Usher, who, like many Poe characters, suffers from an unnamed disease. Like the narrator in \"The Tell-Tale Heart\", this disease inflames Roderick's hyperactive senses. The illness manifests physically but is based in Roderick's mental or even moral state. He is sick, it is suggested, because he expects to be sick based on his family's history of illness and is, therefore, essentially a hypochondriac. Similarly, he buries his sister alive because he expects to bury her alive, creating his own self-fulfilling prophecy.The House of Usher, itself doubly referring both to the actual structure and the family, plays a significant role in the story. It is the first \"character\" that the narrator introduces to the reader, presented with a humanized description: Its windows are described as \"eye-like\" twice in the first paragraph. The fissure that develops in its side is symbolic of the decay of the Usher family and the house \"dies\" along with the two Usher siblings. This connection was emphasized in Roderick's poem \"The Haunted Palace\", which seems to be a direct reference to the house that foreshadows doom.L. Sprague de Camp in his Lovecraft: A Biography wrote that \"[a]ccording to the late [Poe expert] Thomas O. Mabbott, H.P. Lovecraft, in 'Supernatural Horror', solved a problem in the interpretation of Poe\" by arguing that \"Roderick Usher, his sister Madeline, and the house all shared one common soul\".The plot of this tale has prompted many critics to analyze it as a description of the human psyche, comparing, for instance, the House to the unconscious, and its central crack to a split personality. An incestuous relationship between Roderick and Madeline never is explicitly stated, but seems implied by the attachment between the two siblings.Opium, which Poe mentions several times in both his prose and poems, is mentioned twice in the tale. The gloomy sensation occasioned by the dreary landscape around the Usher mansion is compared by the narrator to the sickness caused by the withdrawal symptoms of an opiate-addict. The narrator also describes Roderick Usher's appearance as that of an \"irreclaimable eater of opium.\"While there are no direct statements supporting their conclusions, scholars have demonstrated the language deployed by Roderick to describe his sister as full of hints of the possible incestuous relationship between the twins. They argue that this perversion is the actual cause of the fall of the house as well as an end to the lineage of Ushers.", "hasanswer": false}]}

After training, he worked in the Second Chief Directorate (counterintelligence), before he was transferred to the First Chief Directorate, where he monitored foreigners and consular officials in Leningrad. In September 1984, Putin was sent to Moscow for further training at the Yuri Andropov Red Banner Institute.Multiple reports have suggested Putin was sent by the KGB to New Zealand, corroborated through New Zealand eyewitness accounts and government records. This has never been confirmed by Russian security services. Former Wait\u0101kere City mayor Bob Harvey and former prime minister David Lange alleged that Putin served in Wellington and Auckland. He allegedly worked for some time undercover as a Bata shoe salesman in central Wellington.From 1985 to 1990, he served in Dresden, East Germany, using a cover identity as a translator. While posted in Dresden, Putin worked as one of the KGB's liaison officers to the Stasi secret police and was reportedly promoted to lieutenant colonel. According to the official Kremlin presidential site, the East German communist regime commended Putin with a bronze medal for \"faithful service to the National People's Army.\" Putin has publicly conveyed delight over his activities in Dresden, once recounting his confrontations with anti-communist protestors of 1989 who attempted the occupation of Stasi buildings in the city.\"Putin and his colleagues were reduced mainly to collecting press clippings, thus contributing to the mountains of useless information produced by the KGB,\" Russian-American Masha Gessen wrote in their 2012 biography of Putin. His work was also downplayed by former Stasi spy chief Markus Wolf and Putin's former KGB colleague Vladimir Usoltsev. Journalist Catherine Belton wrote in 2020 that this downplaying was actually cover for Putin's involvement in KGB coordination and support for the terrorist Red Army Faction, whose members frequently hid in East Germany with the support of the Stasi. Dresden was preferred as a \"marginal\" town with only a small presence of Western intelligence services. According to an anonymous source who claimed to be a former RAF member, at one of these meetings in Dresden the militants presented Putin with a list of weapons that were later delivered to the RAF in West Germany. Klaus Zuchold, who claimed to be recruited by Putin, said that Putin handled a neo-Nazi, Rainer Sonntag, and attempted to recruit an author of a study on poisons. Putin reportedly met Germans to be recruited for wireless communications affairs together with an interpreter. He was involved in wireless communications technologies in South-East Asia due to trips of German engineers, recruited by him, there and to the West. However, a 2023 investigation by Der Spiegel reported that the anonymous source had never been an RAF member and \"considered a notorious fabulist\" with \"several previous convictions, including for making false statements.\"\nAccording to Putin's official biography, during the fall of the Berlin Wall that began on 9 November 1989, he saved the files of the Soviet Cultural Center (House of Friendship) and of the KGB villa in Dresden for the official authorities of the would-be united Germany to prevent demonstrators, including KGB and Stasi agents, from obtaining and destroying them. He then supposedly burnt only the KGB files, in a few hours, but saved the archives of the Soviet Cultural Center for the German authorities. Nothing is told about the selection criteria during this burning; for example, concerning Stasi files or about files of other agencies of the German Democratic Republic or of the USSR. He explained that many documents were left to Germany only because the furnace burst but many documents of the KGB villa were sent to Moscow.After the collapse of the Communist East German government, Putin was to resign from active KGB service because of suspicions aroused regarding his loyalty during demonstrations in Dresden and earlier, though the KGB and the Soviet Army still operated in eastern Germany. He returned to Leningrad in early 1990 as a member of the \"active reserves,\" where he worked for about three months with the International Affairs section of Leningrad State University, reporting to Vice-Rector Yuriy Molchanov, while working on his doctoral dissertation.There, he looked for new KGB recruits, watched the student body, and renewed his friendship with his former professor, Anatoly Sobchak, soon to be the Mayor of Leningrad. Putin claims that he resigned with the rank of lieutenant colonel on 20 August 1991, on the second day of the 1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt against Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev. Putin said: \"As soon as the coup began, I immediately decided which side I was on,\" although he noted that the choice was hard because he had spent the best part of his life with \"the organs.\"", "hasanswer": false}]}

However, Freedman also noted that the impact of this involvement on US perceptions of the Eastern Front was less clear. The review by Joseph Robert White, titled \"A Noble But Sisyphean Effort\", concluded by quoting the book's closing sentence: \"The 'good German' seems destined for an eternal life\". White observed that the book \"should nonetheless provide food for thought in classroom discussions about the German army\", but noted that an assumption of specialized knowledge and the concomitant lack of a chapter about war crimes committed by the Wehrmacht undermined the authors' efforts to challenge the myth.Historian Lawrence N. Powell lamented in his review how \"The swiftness with which Cold War America embraced vanquished Nazi officers, along with their sanitization of Wehrmacht criminality on the Eastern Front, is a chilling reminder of how historical memory often follows the flag.\" He commended the two authors, saying that they had \"performed a signal service\" in bringing to light these myths about the second World War.The military historian Jonathan House, who wrote the 1995 book When Titans Clashed on the Soviet\u2013German War with David Glantz, reviewed the book for The Journal of Military History, describing it as a \"tour de force of cultural historiography\". He noted Smelser's and Davies's analysis of the post-war mythology that presented the Wehrmacht and even the Waffen-SS as \"above reproach, knights engaged in a crusade to defend Western civilization against the barbaric hordes of Bolshevism. ... Ronald Smelser and Edward Davies have performed a signal service by tracing the origin and spread of this mythology\". House recommended that military historians not only study the book, but \"use it to teach students the dangers of bias and propaganda in history\". He also noted that in exploring its subject, the book provided a \"one-sided view of the historiography\" by not taking into account the contemporary, balanced works on the Soviet\u2013German War, such as by Glantz and others.Edward B. Westermann, historian and author of Hitler's Police Battalions: Enforcing Racial War in the East, called it \"A superb and insightful study of the premeditated manipulation of history and memory in the fabrication of the myth of a 'clean Wehrmacht'.\" He further stated that it \"Expertly exposes the intersection and influence of popular imagination, politics, and popular culture in the rewriting of the German army's experience in World War Two.\"Benjamin Alpers, in The American Historical Review, the official publication of the American Historical Association, noted that the book \"present[s] a discomforting portrait of the American views of the Eastern Front.\" He commended the authors \"for exploring sources such as website and war games, that, while usually not studied by historians, are places where Americans encounter and enact World War II memory\". However, the review also concluded that the authors' analysis of their material \"is not entirely convincing\", and also observed that they underplayed key divergences in their analogy between neo-Confederate ideas of the American Civil War and the mythic views of the Eastern Front.Historian Norman J. W. Goda, who specialized in the history of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust, called the book \"a masterful and incisive combination of military and cultural history\". He added that the two authors \"vividly show how the pernicious idea of an honorable German war on the Eastern Front permeated the American consciousness with devastating consequences not only for the broad understanding of German atrocities in the East, but ultimately for the Cold War itself.\"Professor Christopher A. Hartwell provided a critical assessment of the book in a review published in German Studies Review. He described the book as \"interesting, but ultimately disappointing\" and argued that the authors committed several egregious errors, with the most prominent being the whitewash of Red Army crimes on the Eastern Front, while denigrating those [authors] who do mention them \"as contributing to the exoneration of the Wehrmacht\". He noted that the book tends to suffer from a lack of perspective \"on the effect the German generals had on the broader American perception of the war [on the Eastern Front].\" Furthermore, Hartwell stated that the effect and influence of those \"romancers\" on American culture was not \"impressively support[ed]\" in the thesis, and the case that \"romancers\" were able to \"effectively spread the myth of the innocent Wehrmacht\" was not made out. Due to the lack of perspective, the book tended to lump together \"those with an interest in military history and those who actually subscribe to neo-Nazi beliefs\", and Hartwell concluded: \"As it stands now, however, this tome has the feel of a dissertation that is trying too hard to find a niche that hasn't seen the light of day\".Kelly McFall of Newman University described the book as a \"fascinating immersion into a simple but important question: How did the German soldiers who fought on the eastern front during World War Two become hero figures to so many Americans?\" McFall found the discussion on the iconography of the 1970s and 1980s wargames to be \"path-breaking\" and noted that the authors convinced her of the \"existence of a community of 'buffs' who have made a fetish of the German army as super-efficient and super-heroic\". However, she added that it was unclear how influential this community is outside of its niche, and what impact the rise of computer gaming may have had on this group.David Wildermuth of Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania concurred with the author's argument regarding the potential danger of \"depoliticiz[ing] a conflict which at its core was a war of racial subjugation and conquest\". He found the authors' analysis of war-romancing trends to be \"deep and compelling\", but noted the book's limitations in assuming specialist knowledge, which made it less accessible to the public. For example, lay readers would have benefited from the context of the differences between Waffen-SS and Wehrmacht, along with an overview of the war crimes committed by the Waffen-SS, \"especially in light of the falsehoods appearing daily in Internet website chatrooms\". The reviewer also remarked on the occasional sniping which made palpable the authors' frustrations with \"romantic notions of a valiant German military\". Despite this minor criticism, Wildermuth commended the book for its \"fascinating analysis on how, far removed from its time and place, the echoes of this war still reverberate\".Martin H. Folly provided a critical assessment of the book in a review published in the journal History. While he complimented the authors for setting out the main myths concerning the Eastern Front, he argued that they did not provide convincing evidence to support their argument that most Americans accept such an account of the Soviet\u2013German War. Moreover, Folly stated that the book overlooked the influence of prominent and more accurate accounts of the war on the Eastern Front. His summary was that \"the book therefore delivers a rather weak conclusion, which dilutes the impact of the useful analysis earlier in the book on the creation of the myth by German ex-participants and its entry into American culture with the help of the US Army\".American historian Dennis Showalter, in his review of the book for the journal Central European History, described the book as \"incomplete\", noting that \"Eastern Front romanticism has cultural as well as intellectual matrices that are a good deal more complex than Smelser and Davis acknowledge\", such as the appeal of \"individual struggle against overwhelming odds\" in the German narratives of the war, vs the Soviet emphasis on the collective. He also described how the Soviet World War II historiography, overly dogmatic and propaganda-driven, remained untranslated in the West, allowing the German view of the conflict to dominate academic and popular perceptions. He acknowledged that the romanticized views described in the book existed but argued that they remain limited in their impact on the wider popular culture: \"Third Reich military memorabilia thrives\u2014but in a niche market. (...) Eastern Front enthusiasts\u2014who buy a disproportionate number of the books romanticizing the Eastern Front\u2014are a minority within a minority, and, as a rule, are at some pains to deny sympathy with the Third Reich\". The reviewer concludes that opening of the archives since the dissolution of the Soviet Union has enabled \"balanced analysis at academic levels\", leading to a new interest in the Red Army operations from the popular history writers and the World War II enthusiasts.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The recently widowed Duchess falls in love with Antonio, a lowly steward. Her brothers, Ferdinand and the Cardinal, forbid her from remarrying, seeking to defend their inheritance and desperate to avoid a degrading association with a social inferior. Suspicious of her, they hire Bosola to spy on her. She elopes with Antonio and bears him three children secretly. Bosola eventually discovers that the Duchess is pregnant but does not know who the father is.\nFerdinand, shown by now to be a depraved lunatic, threatens and disowns the Duchess. In an attempt to escape, she and Antonio concoct a story that Antonio has swindled her out of her fortune and must flee into exile. The Duchess takes Bosola into her confidence, unaware that he is Ferdinand's spy, and arranges for him to deliver her jewellery to Antonio at his hiding-place in Ancona. She will join them later, while pretending to make a pilgrimage to a nearby town. The Cardinal hears of the plan, instructs Bosola to banish the two lovers, and sends soldiers to capture them. Antonio escapes with their eldest son, but the Duchess, her maid, and her two younger children are returned to Malfi and die at the hands of Bosola's executioners, who are under Ferdinand's orders. This experience leads Bosola to turn against the brothers, and he decides to take up the cause of \u201crevenge for the Duchess of Malfi\u201d (5.2).\nThe Cardinal confesses his part in the killing of the Duchess to his mistress, Julia, then murders her with a poisoned Bible. Bosola overhears the Cardinal plotting to kill him, so he visits the darkened chapel to kill the Cardinal at his prayers. Instead, he mistakenly kills Antonio, who has just returned to Malfi to attempt a reconciliation with the Cardinal. Bosola then stabs the Cardinal, who dies. In the brawl that follows, Ferdinand and Bosola stab each other to death.\nAntonio's elder son by the Duchess appears in the final scene and takes his place as the heir to the Malfi fortune. The son's decision is in spite of his father's explicit wish that he \"fly the court of princes\", a corrupt and increasingly deadly environment.\nThe conclusion is controversial for some readers because they find reason to believe the inheriting son is not the rightful heir of the Duchess. The play briefly mentions a son who is the product of her first marriage and would therefore have a stronger claim to the duchy. Other scholars believe the mention of a prior son is just a careless error in the text.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Buddhist scholar monks Rewata Dhamma and Bhikkhu Bodhi describe the Abhidharma as \"an abstract and highly technical systemization of the doctrine\". According to Theravada tradition, the Abhidharma, or \"Higher Dharma\", is said to have been preached by the Buddha to devas while he was spending the rainy season in Tavatimsa Heaven. It is said that the Buddha returned to earth daily to give a summary to \u015a\u0101riputra, who classified and reordered the teachings and relayed it to his disciples, in what would become the Abhidharma Pitaka. Various sets of the Sarvastivada school of Buddhism, however, attribute each of the seven books of the Abhidharma to different authors, with \u015a\u0101riputra being attributed as the author of just the Sangitiparyaya in the Chinese Sarvastivada tradition and as the author of the Dharmaskandha in the Sanskrit and Tibetan Sarvastivada traditions. In the Vatsiputriya tradition, a subset of the Sarvastivada school, \u015a\u0101riputra is said to have transmitted the Abhidharma to Rahula, who later transmitted it to the school's founder, Vatsiputra. As the author of the Abhidharma in Buddhist tradition, \u015a\u0101riputra is considered to be the patron saint of the Abhidharmists.French religion writer Andr\u00e9 Migot, argues that the Abhidharma was formulated no earlier than the time of Emperor Asoka, and thus cannot really be attributed to the historic \u015a\u0101riputra, at least not the version known by modern scholars. English historian Edward J. Thomas dates the development of the Abhidharma as being sometime between the third century BCE and the first century CE. However, Migot states that a simpler version of the Abhidharma likely existed in early Buddhism, before it evolved and was written down in its current form. Migot points to the mention of the \"Matrka\" Pitaka in Cullavagga texts as the precursor to the Abhidharma Pitaka. Migot argues that the Matrka Pitaka, recited by Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa at the First Buddhist Council according to Ashokavadana texts, likely began as a condensed version of Buddhist doctrine that developed over time with metaphysical aspects to become the Abhidharma. Thomas also states that the Abhidharma had earlier roots and was developed based on existing material, likely a method of discussing the principles of the Buddha's teachings. According to Thomas, different Buddhist schools compiled their own Abhidharma works separately, but based it on common existing material.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was printed in-folio, meaning that the pages were 18 inches (46 cm) tall and nearly 20 inches (51 cm) wide. The paper was of the finest quality available, the cost of which ran to nearly \u00a31,600; more than Johnson had been paid to write the book. Johnson himself pronounced the book \"Vasta mole superbus\" (\"Proud in its great bulk\"). No bookseller could possibly hope to print this book without help; outside a few special editions of the Bible no book of this heft and size had ever been set to type.\nThe title page reads:\n\nThe words \"Samuel Johnson\" and \"English Language\" were printed in red; the rest was printed in black. The preface and headings were set in 4.6 mm \"English\" type, the text\u2014double columned\u2014was set in 3.5 mm pica. This first edition of the dictionary contained a 42,773-word list, to which only a few more were added in subsequent editions. One of Johnson's important innovations was to illustrate the meanings of his words by literary quotation, of which there are around 114,000. The authors most frequently cited by Johnson include Shakespeare, Milton and Dryden. For example:\n\nOPULENCEWealth; riches; affluence\"There in full opulence a banker dwelt,\nWho all the joys and pangs of riches felt;\nHis sideboard glitter'd with imagin'd plate,\nAnd his proud fancy held a vast estate.\"\n-- Jonathan SwiftFurthermore, Johnson, unlike Bailey, added notes on a word's usage, rather than being merely descriptive.\nUnlike most modern lexicographers, Johnson introduced humour or prejudice into quite a number of his definitions. Among the best-known are:\n\n\"Excise: a hateful tax levied upon commodities and adjudged not by the common judges of property but wretches hired by those to whom excise is paid\"\n\"Lexicographer: a writer of dictionaries; a harmless drudge that busies himself in tracing the original and detailing the signification of words\"\n\"Oats: a grain which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland supports the people\"A couple of less well-known examples are:\n\n\"Monsieur: a term of reproach for a Frenchman\"\n\"Patron: One who countenances, supports, or protects. Commonly a wretch who supports with insolence, and is paid with flattery.\" which some have understood to be a jab at his patron Philip Stanhope.He included whimsical little-known words, such as:\n\n\"Writative \u2013 A word of Pope's, not to be imitated: \"Increase of years makes men more talkative but less writative; to that degree I now write letters but of plain how d'ey's.\"\"On a more serious level, Johnson's work showed a heretofore unseen meticulousness. Unlike all the proto-dictionaries that had come before, painstaking care went into the completeness when it came not only to \"illustrations\" but also to definitions as well:\n\n\"Turn\" had 16 definitions with 15 illustrations\n\"Time\" had 20 definitions with 14 illustrations\n\"Put\" ran more than 5,000 words spread over 3 pages\n\"Take\" had 134 definitions, running 8,000 words, over 5 pagesThe original goal was to publish the dictionary in two folio volumes: A\u2013K and L\u2013Z. But that soon proved unwieldy, unprofitable, and unrealistic. Subsequent printings ran to four volumes; even these formed a stack 10 inches (25 cm) tall, and weighed in at nearly 21 pounds (9.5 kg). In addition to the sheer physical heft of Johnson's dictionary, came the equally hefty price: \u00a34/10/\u2013 (equivalent to approximately \u00a3744 in 2024). So discouraging was the price that by 1784, thirty years after the first edition was published, when the dictionary had by then run through five editions, only about 6,000 copies were in circulation\u2014an average sale of 200 books a year for thirty years.Johnson's etymologies would be considered poor by modern standards, and he gave little guide to pronunciation; one example being \"Cough: A convulsion of the lungs, vellicated by some sharp serosity. It is pronounced coff\". Much of his dictionary was prescriptivist. It was also linguistically conservative, advocating traditional spellings such as publick rather than the simpler spellings that would be favoured 73 years later by Noah Webster.\nThe dictionary is in alphabetical order according to the eighteenth-century English alphabet. In the eighteenth century, the letters I and J were considered different forms of the same letter; the same with letters U and V. As a result, in Johnson's dictionary the word jargon comes before the word idle, and vagabond comes before ultimate.In spite of its shortcomings, the dictionary was far and away the best of its day. Its scope and structure were carried forward in dictionaries that followed, including Noah Webster's Webster's Dictionary in 1828 and the Oxford English Dictionary later in the same century.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "50_573", "question": "Who was the author of \"New X-Men\"?", "ctxs": [{"id": "123_35644", "text": "By the early 1980s, Uncanny X-Men (under the authorship of Chris Claremont) had become one of the comic book industry's most successful titles, prompting Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter to launch The New Mutants, the first of several X-Men spin-offs. X-Men editor Louise Simonson recalled \"Neither Chris [Claremont] or I really wanted to do it. We wanted X-Men to be special and by itself, but Shooter told us that if we didn't come up with a new 'mutant' book, someone else would.\" The name was a modification of Stan Lee's original name for the X-Men, \"The Mutants\".The New Mutants were teenaged students of Professor Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters and wore matching uniforms, much like the original X-Men, who had since grown into adulthood. These students resembled the \"all-new, all-different X-Men\" of their era in terms of ethnic diversity.\nThe original team consisted of:\n\nCannonball (Samuel Guthrie), a 16-year-old boy from Kentucky, United States and eventual co-leader, with the ability to generate thermo-chemical energy and propel himself through the air.\nKarma (M\u1ea1nh Cao Xu\u00e2n), a 19-year-old girl from Vietnam and the team's original leader, who could mentally possess other people's bodies.\nMirage (Danielle Moonstar, originally codenamed Psyche), a girl who is a Cheyenne Native American and eventual co-leader after Karma's apparent death, who could create visual empathic three-dimensional illusions.\nSunspot (Roberto da Costa), a 14-year-old boy from Brazil who had superhuman strength fueled by sunlight and could store solar energy in his body to use his super strength.\nWolfsbane (Rahne Sinclair), a 13-year-old religious girl from Scotland, United Kingdom who could transform into a wolf and a werewolf-like creature.The team was intended to debut in their own series. As the first issue was nearing completion, Shooter ordered it to be reworked into a graphic novel so that Marvel Graphic Novel could make its deadline for the next issue. Thus, the New Mutants debuted in Marvel Graphic Novel #4 (December 1982), which continued a plotline from Uncanny X-Men.In addition to very serious depictions of teenage angst and growing pains, the series featured themes of mysticism. The stories also relied on wilder, more far-fetched premises than were typical of X-Men at the time, shaping into more of a science fiction and fantasy series than the superhero coming-of-age comic it had been touted as in its early days. Locales included demonic dimensions, alternate futures, and an ancient Roman civilization hidden within the Amazon rainforest. The New Mutants also encountered a secret society called the Hellfire Club, and began a rivalry with their young apprentices, the Hellions.\nAfter the apparent death of Karma, Cannonball and Dani Moonstar act as co-leaders. New recruits included:\n\nCypher (Douglas Ramsey), an otherwise ordinary young man who could learn to read or speak any language rapidly, whether it was human, alien, or machine, making him an unmatched computer expert.\nMagik (Illyana Rasputin), sister of the Russian X-Man Colossus and long-time resident of the X-Mansion, an accomplished mystic who could open \"teleportation discs\" allowing travel to Limbo and from there, any point on Earth.\nMagma (Amara Juliana Olivians Aquilla), a fiercely tempered native of a secret Roman society in the Amazon who can control lava.\nWarlock, an extraterrestrial of the techno-organic race known as the Technarchy. Considered a pariah due to the uncommon trait of empathy.A supplementary New Mutants Annual series began in 1984, though rather than producing an Annual, Marvel skipped a proper Annual in 1985 in favor of \"New Mutants Special Edition\". The first Annual (#1) featured the first appearance of Lila Cheney, a musician styled after Joan Jett who became a love interest to Cannonball and was Bob Mcloed's final work on the original series. The second Annual (#2, 1986) featured the first American appearance of Psylockes; it along with Annual #3 (1987) were drawn by Alan Davis. The 1988 (#4) and 1989 (#5) Annuals were part of the Evolutionary War and Atlantis Attacks \"crossover\" event, with Annual being the first issue of New Mutants drawn by Rob Liefeld. The 1990 Annual (#6) was part of the \"Days of Future Present\" mini-series. It also featured the first appearance (in pin-up form) of Shatterstar, as part of a planned line-up change preview that was ultimately discarded when Louise Simonson left the series. The final Annual (#7) was part of the 1991 \"Kings of Pain\" crossover; it holds the distinction of the last issue of the original series to be published as it takes place and was published between New Mutants #100 and X-Force #1.\nFurthermore, in 1990, Anne Nocenti and Brett Blevins produced an 80 page special called \"New Mutants Summer Special\". The special saw several New Mutants (Boom Boom, Wolfsbane, Sunspot, and Warlock) be dragged into a world of television, which served as a vehicle for Nocenti to discuss mass media theory.In 1986, Professor X was written out of the series. Before he left, he made the X-Men's one-time nemesis, Magneto, headmaster of his school. Magneto would be the team's longest-running headmaster, holding the position from New Mutants #35 through to #75. Fiercely overprotective of his students, particularly after the events of the \"Mutant Massacre\" and \"Fall of the Mutants\", he was increasingly used as an uptight foil for the adventurous New Mutants, setting rules that they would inevitably break in the interests of helping their friends.\nDuring Simonson's run, Magma is written out of the book, and Magik is de-aged back to childhood. Due to his unpopularity with New Mutants readers and artists, Cypher is killed off in The New Mutants #60 (February 1988). Simonson also folded the X-Terminators, a group of young wards from X-Factor, into the New Mutants.The X-Terminators added to the team were:\n\nBoom-Boom (Tabitha Smith), a teen runaway who could create \"plasma bombs.\"\nFirefist (Rusty Collins), a pyrokinetic wanted by the U.S. government.\nRictor (Julio Richter), a young Mexican who could create shock waves.\nSkids (Sally Blevins), a former Morlock who could project a frictionless force field around her body.In 1989, Simonson crafted a saga in which the team journeyed to Asgard, the home of the gods of Norse mythology. The storyline wrote Dani Moonstar out of the series, as she joined the Norse pantheon as one of the Valkyrior. Titled \"Instant Replay!\", the story in New Mutants #64 deals with the New Mutants' mourning for Cypher, and includes a scene in which Warlock attempts to resurrect Cypher by taking his corpse out of its coffin and showing it to Cypher's loved ones.\nA new mentor for the group, the mysterious mercenary Cable, was introduced. Over the next year, several longtime team members were written out or killed off. When Rob Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza took over as writers of the final three issues of the series, they included several harder-edged characters:\n\n\"Domino\" (Vanessa Geraldine Carlysle), Cable's pale-skinned, black-garbed mercenary lover. Actually Copycat, impersonating Domino.\nFeral (Maria Callasantos), who possessed a bestial temperament and appearance.\nShatterstar (Gaveedra Seven), a swashbuckling warrior from another dimension.\nWarpath (James Proudstar), the younger brother of slain X-Man Thunderbird and a former Hellion, an Apache who possessed super strength and speed.The New Mutants was cancelled in 1991 with issue #100, but the new platoon-like team formed by Cable continued in X-Force, and feature a variety of the former New Mutants cast.", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "50_580", "question": "Who is the author of the tragedy \"Medea\"?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_21019", "text": "The form of the play differs from many other Greek tragedies by its simplicity. Most scenes involve only Medea and someone else. The Chorus, here representing the women of Corinth, is usually involved alongside them. The simple encounters highlight Medea's skill and determination in manipulating powerful male figures. The play is also the only Greek tragedy in which a kin-killer makes it unpunished to the end of the play, and the only one about child-killing in which the deed is performed in cold blood as opposed to in a state of temporary madness. Medea's \"rebellion\" is that which shakes the very world everyone must inhabit. Her rebellion tells of her past history, the goddess-like figure denigrated and ultimately dethroned gives lead to why she would act the way she does. Euripides displays Medea as an archetype. As a result, he reinforces the modern stereotype as a woman to be the devourer of men and children, instead of Medea, the great mother wronged.Euripides' characterization of Medea exhibits the inner emotions of passion, love, and vengeance. \nThe character of Medea has variously been interpreted both as fulfilling her role of \"mother and wife\" and as acting as a \"proto-feminist\". \nFeminist readings have interpreted the play as either a \"sympathetic exploration\" of the \"disadvantages of being a woman in a patriarchal society\", or as an expression of misogynist attitudes. \nIn conflict with this sympathetic undertone (or reinforcing a more negative reading) is Medea's barbarian identity, which some argue could antagonize a 5th-century BC Greek audience.It can be argued that in the play Euripides portrays Medea out to be an enraged woman who kills her children to get revenge on her husband Jason because of his betrayal of their marriage. Medea is often cited as an example of the \"madwoman in the attic\" trope, in which women who defy societal norms are portrayed as mentally unstable. Although, Medea is not the only character in the play to use deception; other characters, such as Jason and Creon, also use lies and manipulation. A competing interpretation is that Medea kills her children out of kindness because she cares and worries for them and their well-being. Once Medea commits to her plan to kill Creon and Jason's new bride, she knows her children are in danger of being murdered. Medea is not paranoid. In another version of the myth, the people of Corinth kill her children to avenge the deaths of Creon and his daughter Glauke. At this time in myth and history, helping one's friends and hurting one's enemies was considered a virtue. Thus, by this ethic, the Corinthians will do right by avenging their king and princess. Conversely, a focus on Medea's rage leads to the interpretation that \"Medea becomes the personification of vengeance, with her humanity 'mortified' and 'sloughed off'\" (Cowherd, 129). Medea's heritage places her in a position more typically reserved for the male in her time. Hers is the power of the sun, appropriately symbolized by her great radiance, tremendous heat and boundless passion.  In this view Medea is inhuman and her suffering is self-inflicted just as Jason argues in his debate with her. And yet, if we see events through Medea's eyes, we view a wife intent on vengeance and a mother concerned about her children's safety and the life they can be expected to live. Thus, Medea as wife kills Creon and Glauke in the act of vengeance. Medea as a mother thinks that her children will be better off killed by her kind hand than left to suffer at the hands of an enemy, intent on vengeance. And so, Medea saves her children from this brutality and a worse fate by killing them herself, providing them with as peaceful an outcome as she can.\nEuripides\u2019 tragic character, Medea, is often described as having a \u201cheroic temper,\u201d (Lush, 2014). With this temper, the motive behind much of Medea\u2019s behavior is to avoid the laughter of her enemies, \u201ceven at the cost of decisions that contradict self-interest, personal safety, or strongly held moral beliefs,\u201d (Lush, 2014). Although some may say that her motive is jealousy over Jason\u2019s new bride, Glauce, such reasoning does not fully explain the severity of Medea\u2019s actions. Medea\u2019s temperament suggests that she was more embarrassed than she was angry. She was unwilling to let her enemies, in this case Jason and his new wife, be happy or look down upon her. Medea denied that \u201cher enemies [would] cause her pain and rejoice,\u201d and stated that her priority was to \u201cavoid her enemies\u2019 derision,\u201d (Lush, 2014). Although the murder of her children would cause her pain, Medea\u2019s temperament caused her to prioritize Jason\u2019s unhappiness over anything else. \nLush, B. (2014).

Instead of fleeing, the author befriends the man by sharing cigars and food. They stay in the same primitive inn that night. The guide tells the author that the man is the robber known as Don Jos\u00e9 Navarro and leaves to turn him in, but the author warns Don Jos\u00e9, who escapes.\n\nPart II. Later, in C\u00f3rdoba, the author meets Carmen, a beautiful Gitano (Romani) woman who is fascinated by his repeating watch. He goes to her home so she can tell his fortune, and she impresses him with her occult knowledge. They are interrupted by Don Jos\u00e9, and although Carmen makes throat-cutting gestures, Jos\u00e9 escorts the author out. The author finds his watch is missing.\nSome months later, again in C\u00f3rdoba, a friend of the author's tells him that Don Jos\u00e9 Navarro is to be garrotted the next day. The author visits the prisoner and hears the story of his life.\nPart III. The robber's real name is Jos\u00e9 Lizarrabengoa, and he is a Basque hidalgo from Navarre. He killed a man in a fight resulting from a game of paume (presumably some form of Basque pelota) and had to flee. In Seville he joined a unit of dragoons, soldiers with police functions.\n\nOne day he met Carmen, then working in the cigar factory he was guarding. As he alone in his unit ignored her, she teased him. A few hours later, he arrested her for cutting \"x\"s in a co-worker's face in a quarrel. She convinced him by speaking Basque that she was half Basque, and he let her go, for which he was imprisoned for a month and demoted.\nAfter his release, he encountered her again and she repaid him with a day of bliss, followed by another when he allowed her fellow smugglers to pass his post. He looked for her at the house of one of her Romani friends, but she entered with his lieutenant. In the ensuing fight, Jos\u00e9 killed the lieutenant. He fled to Carmen's outlaw band.\nWith the outlaws, he progressed from smuggling to robbery, and was sometimes with Carmen but suffered from jealousy as she used her attractions to further the band's enterprises; he also learned that she was married. After her husband joined the band, Jos\u00e9 provoked a knife fight with him and killed him. Carmen became Jos\u00e9's wife.\nHowever, she told him she loved him less than before, and she became attracted to a successful young picador named Lucas. Jos\u00e9, mad with jealousy, begged her to forsake other men and live with him; they could start an honest life in America. She said that she knew from omens that he was fated to kill her, but \"Carmen will always be free,\" and as she now hated herself for having loved him, she would never give in to him. He stabbed her to death and then turned himself in. Don Jos\u00e9 ends his tale by saying that the Romani are to blame for the way they raised Carmen.\nPart IV. This part consists of scholarly remarks on the Romani: their appearance, their customs, their conjectured history, and their language. According to Henri Martineau, editor of a collection of M\u00e9rim\u00e9e's fiction, the etymologies at the end are \"extremely suspect\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Failing that, he believed that state governments and the people would be in an advantageous position over a federal military when engaging in the natural right to self-defense. Federalist No. 28 gave a more sympathetic portrayal of state governments than most of the Federalist Papers, describing them as a check on the federal government.

{"id": "50_587", "question": "Who is the author of the play \"Macbeth\"?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_21050", "text": "A principal source comes from the Daemonologie of King James published in 1597 which included a news pamphlet titled Newes from Scotland that detailed the famous North Berwick witch trials of 1590. The publication of Daemonologie came just a few years before the tragedy of Macbeth with the themes and setting in a direct and comparative contrast with King James' personal obsessions with witchcraft, which developed following his conclusion that the stormy weather that threatened his passage from Denmark to Scotland was a targeted attack. Not only did the subsequent trials take place in Scotland, the women accused were recorded, under torture, of having conducted rituals with the same mannerisms as the three witches. One of the evidenced passages is referenced when the women under trial confessed to attempt the use of witchcraft to raise a tempest and sabotage the boat King James and his queen were on board during their return trip from Denmark. The three witches discuss the raising of winds at sea in the opening lines of Act 1 Scene 3.Macbeth has been compared to Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra. As characters, both Antony and Macbeth seek a new world, even at the cost of the old one. Both fight for a throne and have a 'nemesis' to face to achieve that throne. For Antony, the nemesis is Octavius; for Macbeth, it is Banquo. At one point Macbeth even compares himself to Antony, saying \"under Banquo / My Genius is rebuk'd, as it is said / Mark Antony's was by Caesar.\" Lastly, both plays contain powerful and manipulative female figures: Cleopatra and Lady Macbeth.Shakespeare borrowed the story from several tales in Holinshed's Chronicles, a popular history of the British Isles well known to Shakespeare and his contemporaries. In Chronicles, a man named Donwald finds several of his family put to death by his king, Duff, for dealing with witches. After being pressured by his wife, he and four of his servants kill the king in his own house. In Chronicles, Macbeth is portrayed as struggling to support the kingdom in the face of King Duncan's ineptitude. He and Banquo meet the three witches, who make exactly the same prophecies as in Shakespeare's version. Macbeth and Banquo then together plot the murder of Duncan, at Lady Macbeth's urging. Macbeth has a long, ten-year reign before eventually being overthrown by Macduff and Malcolm. The parallels between the two versions are clear. However, some scholars think that George Buchanan's Rerum Scoticarum Historia matches Shakespeare's version more closely. Buchanan's work was available in Latin in Shakespeare's day.No medieval account of the reign of Macbeth mentions the Weird Sisters, Banquo, or Lady Macbeth, and with the exception of the latter none actually existed. The characters of Banquo, the Weird Sisters, and Lady Macbeth were first mentioned in 1527 by a Scottish historian Hector Boece in his book Historia Gentis Scotorum (History of the Scottish People) who wanted to denigrate Macbeth in order to strengthen the claim of the House of Stewart to the Scottish throne. Boece portrayed Banquo as an ancestor of the Stewart kings of Scotland, adding in a \"prophecy\" that the descendants of Banquo would be the rightful kings of Scotland while the Weird Sisters served to give a picture of King Macbeth as gaining the throne via dark supernatural forces. Macbeth did have a wife, but it is not clear if she was as power-hungry and ambitious as Boece portrayed her, which served his purpose of having even Macbeth realise he lacked a proper claim to the throne, and only took it at the urging of his wife. Holinshed accepted Boece's version of Macbeth's reign at face value and included it in his Chronicles. Shakespeare saw the dramatic possibilities in the story as related by Holinshed, and used it as the basis for the play.No other version of the story has Macbeth kill the king in Macbeth's own castle. Scholars have seen this change of Shakespeare's as adding to the darkness of Macbeth's crime as the worst violation of hospitality. Versions of the story that were common at the time had Duncan being killed in an ambush at Inverness, not in a castle. Shakespeare conflated the story of Donwald and King Duff in what was a significant change to the story.Shakespeare made another important change. In Chronicles, Banquo is an accomplice in Macbeth's murder of King Duncan, and plays an important part in ensuring that Macbeth, not Malcolm, takes the throne in the coup that follows. In Shakespeare's day, Banquo was thought to be an ancestor of the Stuart King James I. (In the 19th century it was established that Banquo is an unhistorical character; the Stuarts are actually descended from a Breton family which migrated to Scotland slightly later than Macbeth's time.) The Banquo portrayed in earlier sources is significantly different from the Banquo created by Shakespeare. Critics have proposed several reasons for this change. First, to portray the king's ancestor as a murderer would have been risky. Other authors of the time who wrote about Banquo, such as Jean de Schelandre in his Stuartide, also changed history by portraying Banquo as a noble man, not a murderer, probably for the same reasons. Second, Shakespeare may have altered Banquo's character simply because there was no dramatic need for another accomplice to the murder; there was, however, a need to give a dramatic contrast to Macbeth\u2014a role which many scholars argue is filled by Banquo.Other scholars maintain that a strong argument can be made for associating the tragedy with the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. As presented by Harold Bloom in 2008: \"[S]cholars cite the existence of several topical references in Macbeth to the events of that year, namely the execution of the Father Henry Garnet for his alleged complicity in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, as referenced in the porter's scene.\" Those arrested for their role in the Gunpowder Plot refused to give direct answers to the questions posed to them by their interrogators, which reflected the influence of the Jesuit practice of equivocation. Shakespeare, by having Macbeth say that demons \"palter...in a double sense\" and \"keep the promise to our ear/And break it to our hope\", confirmed James's belief that equivocation was a \"wicked\" practice, which reflected in turn the \"wickedness\" of the Catholic Church. Garnet had in his possession A Treatise on Equivocation, and in the play the Weird Sisters often engage in equivocation, for instance telling Macbeth that he could never be overthrown until \"Great Birnan wood to high Dunsinane hill/Shall Come\". Macbeth interprets the prophecy as meaning never, but in fact, the Three Sisters refer only to branches of the trees of Great Birnam coming to Dunsinane hill. The inspiration for this prophecy may have originated with the Battle of Droizy; both that battle and Macbeth may have, in turn, inspired J. R. R. Tolkien's tree herders, the Ents in his novels The Lord of the Rings.", "hasanswer": false}]}

To be treated with psychoanalysis, whatever the presenting problem, the person requesting help must demonstrate a desire to start an analysis. The person wishing to start an analysis must have some capacity for speech and communication. As well, they need to be able to have or develop trust and insight within the psychoanalytic session. Potential patients must undergo a preliminary stage of treatment to assess their amenability to psychoanalysis at that time, and also to enable the analyst to form a working psychological model, which the analyst will use to direct the treatment. Psychoanalysts mainly work with neurosis and hysteria in particular; however, adapted forms of psychoanalysis are used in working with schizophrenia and other forms of psychosis or mental disorder. Finally, if a prospective patient is severely suicidal a longer preliminary stage may be employed, sometimes with sessions which have a twenty-minute break in the middle. There are numerous modifications in technique under the heading of psychoanalysis due to the individualistic nature of personality in both analyst and patient.\nThe most common problems treatable with psychoanalysis include: phobias, conversions, compulsions, obsessions, anxiety attacks, depressions, sexual dysfunctions, a wide variety of relationship problems (such as dating and marital strife), and a wide variety of character problems (for example, painful shyness, meanness, obnoxiousness, workaholism, hyperseductiveness, hyperemotionality, hyperfastidiousness). The fact that many of such patients also demonstrate deficits above makes diagnosis and treatment selection difficult.\nAnalytical organizations such as the IPA, APsaA and the European Federation for Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy have established procedures and models for the indication and practice of psychoanalytical therapy for trainees in analysis. The match between the analyst and the patient can be viewed as another contributing factor for the indication and contraindication for psychoanalytic treatment. The analyst decides whether the patient is suitable for psychoanalysis. This decision made by the analyst, besides made on the usual indications and pathology, is also based to a certain degree by the \"fit\" between analyst and patient. A person's suitability for analysis at any particular time is based on their desire to know something about where their illness has come from. Someone who is not suitable for analysis expresses no desire to know more about the root causes of their illness.\nAn evaluation may include one or more other analysts' independent opinions and will include discussion of the patient's financial situation and insurances.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The Catholic Church was in the midst of the Western Schism and, although it was still the only Christian authority in Western Europe, it was the subject of heavy controversy.

The Canterbury Tales is among the first English literary works to mention paper, a relatively new invention that allowed dissemination of the written word never before seen in England. Political clashes, such as the 1381 Peasants' Revolt and clashes ending in the deposing of King Richard II, further reveal the complex turmoil surrounding Chaucer in the time of the Tales' writing.

It described over 2040 species, over half of which were published for the first time.Brown's Prodromus was originally published as Volume One, and following the Praemonenda (Preface), page numbering commences on page 145. Sales of the Prodromus were so poor, however, that Brown withdrew it from sale. Due to the commercial failure of the first volume, pages 1 to 144 were never issued, and Brown never produced the additional volumes that he had planned.In 1813, a book of illustrations for the Prodromus was published separately by Ferdinand Bauer under the title Ferdinandi Bauer Illustrationes florae Novae Hollandiae sive icones generum quae in Prodromo florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen descripsit Robertus Brown, usually referred to as Illustrationes Florae Novae Hollandiae.

{"id": "50_597", "question": "Who was the author of the Encyclop\u00e9die?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_21101", "text": "The work consisted of 28 volumes, with 71,818 articles and 3,129 illustrations. The first seventeen volumes were published between 1751 and 1765; eleven volumes of plates were finished by 1772. Engraver Robert B\u00e9nard provided at least 1,800 plates for the work. The Encyclop\u00e9die sold 4,000 copies during its first twenty years of publication and earned a profit of 2 million livres for its investors. Because of its occasional radical contents, the Encyclop\u00e9die caused much controversy in conservative circles, and after the publication of the second volume, it was briefly suspended from publishing by royal edict of 1752. Joly de Fleury accused it of \"destroying royal authority, fomenting a spirit of Independence and revolt, and...laying the foundations of an edifice of error, for the corruption of morals and religion, and the promotion of unbelief.\"Following the publication of the seventh volume, on the initiative of the Parlement of Paris, the French government suspended the encyclopedia's privil\u00e8ge in 1759.  Despite these issues, work continued \"in secret,\" partially because the project had highly placed supporters, such as Malesherbes and Madame de Pompadour. The authorities deliberately ignored the continued work; they thought their official ban was sufficient to appease the church and other enemies of the project.\nDuring the \"secretive\" period, Diderot accomplished a work of subterfuge. The title pages of volumes 1 through 7, published between 1751 and 1757, claimed Paris as the place of publication. However, the title pages of the subsequent text volumes, 8 through 17, published together in 1765, show Neufchastel as the place of publication. Neuch\u00e2tel is safely across the French border in what is now part of Switzerland but which was then an independent principality, where official production of the Encyclop\u00e9die was secure from interference by agents of the French state. In particular, regime opponents of the Encyclop\u00e9die could not seize the production plates for the Encyclop\u00e9die in Paris because those printing plates ostensibly existed only in Switzerland. Meanwhile, the actual production of volumes 8 through 17 quietly continued in Paris.\nIn 1775, Charles Joseph Panckoucke obtained the rights to reissue the work. He issued five volumes of supplementary material and a two-volume index from 1776 to 1780. Some scholars include these seven \"extra\" volumes as part of the first full issue of the Encyclop\u00e9die, for a total of 35 volumes, although they were not written or edited by the original authors.\nFrom 1782 to 1832, Panckoucke and his successors published an expanded edition of the work in some 166 volumes as the Encyclop\u00e9die M\u00e9thodique. That work, enormous for its time, occupied a thousand workers in production and 2,250 contributors.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Eliot said of Ulysses: \"I hold this book to be the most important expression which the present age has found; it is a book to which we are all indebted, and from which none of us can escape.\" He went on to assert that Joyce was not at fault if people after him did not understand it: \"The next generation is responsible for its own soul; a man of genius is responsible to his peers, not to a studio full of uneducated and undisciplined coxcombs.\"Ezra Pound wrote, \"All men should 'Unite to give praise to Ulysses'; those who will not, may content themselves with a place in the lower intellectual orders.\" He claimed that in writing Ulysses, \"this super-novel\", Joyce surpassed Gustave Flaubert, Miguel de Cervantes, Henry James, and Marcel Proust, concluding that, besides Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, he \"can think of no other prose writer whose proportional status in pan-literature is not modified by the advent of Ulysses.\"The essayist John Eglinton wrote of Joyce's method: \"Mr Joyce has wished to devise a species of literary notation which will express the interuptedness of life. We cannot hold our minds to any one purpose or idea for more than a few moments at a time\". He interprets Joyce's purpose as \"produc[ing] a work of virgin art!\"William Carlos Williams found Joyce's style in Ulysses richer than in his previous works. He called it a \"priestly style and Joyce is himself a priest...Joyce discloses the X-Ray eyes of the confessional, we see\u2026the naked soul\u2026[Joyce] has compared up his reader with God.\"Ulysses has been called \"the most prominent landmark in modernist literature\", a work where life's complexities are depicted with \"unprecedented, and unequalled, linguistic and stylistic virtuosity\". That style has been called the finest example of stream-of-consciousness in modern fiction, with Joyce going deeper and farther than any other novelist in interior monologue and stream of consciousness. This technique has been praised for its faithful representation of the flow of thought, feeling, and mental reflection, as well as shifts of mood.According to Declan Kiberd, \"Before Joyce, no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of thinking.\" S. L. Goldberg has argued that interior monologue in Ulysses is rooted in Joyce's epiphany technique. For Goldberg, the epiphany is \"the real artistic (and dramatic) unit of Joyce's 'stream-of-consciousness' writing. What he renders dramatically are minds engaged in the apprehension of epiphanies\u2014the elements of meaning apprehended in life.\" Another critic has identified four distinct epiphany techniques in Joyce's work, noting their use in Ulysses, from the simplest device, such as the revelation of Gerty Macdowell\u2019s limp, to the more complex, such as the bowl symbolism in \"Telemachus\". Cited as an example of Joyce\u2019s major epiphany technique\u2014quidditas produced directly\u2014is the revelation of Molly Bloom as \"female essence\".Literary critic Edmund Wilson noted that Ulysses attempts to render \"as precisely and as directly as it is possible in words to do, what our participation in life is like\u2014or rather, what it seems to us like as from moment to moment we live.\" Stuart Gilbert said that the \"personages of Ulysses are not fictitious\" but that \"these people are as they must be; they act, we see, according to some lex eterna, an ineluctable condition of their very existence\". Through these characters Joyce \"achieves a coherent and integral interpretation of life\".Joyce uses \"metaphors, symbols, ambiguities, and overtones which gradually link themselves together so as to form a network of connections binding the whole\" work. This system of connections gives the novel a wide, more universal significance, as \"Leopold Bloom becomes a modern Ulysses, an Everyman in a Dublin which becomes a microcosm of the world.\" Eliot called this system the \"mythic method\": \"a way of controlling, of ordering, of giving a shape and a significance to the immense panorama of futility and anarchy which is contemporary history\". Novelist Vladimir Nabokov called Ulysses a \"divine work of art\" and the greatest masterpiece of 20th-century prose, and said that \"it towers above the rest of Joyce's writing\" with \"noble originality, unique lucidity of thought and style\". Psychology professor Charles Fernyhough called Ulysses \"the archetypal stream of consciousness novel\".The book had its critics, largely in response to its then-uncommon inclusion of sexual elements. Shane Leslie called Ulysses \"literary Bolshevism ... experimental, anti-conventional, anti-Christian, chaotic, totally unmoral\". Karl Radek called it \"a heap of dung, crawling with worms, photographed by a cinema camera through a microscope\". Sisley Huddleston, writing for the Observer, wrote: \"I confess that I cannot see how the work upon which Mr Joyce spent seven strenuous years, years of wrestling and of agony, can ever be given to the public.\" Virginia Woolf wrote, \"Ulysses was a memorable catastrophe\u2014immense in daring, terrific in disaster.\" James Douglas, in the Sunday Express, said it contained \"secret sewers of vice ... canalized in its flood of unimaginable thoughts, images, and pornographic words\" and \"revolting blasphemies\" that \"debases and perverts and degrades the noble gift of imagination and wit and lordship of language\". Writing in America Magazine in 1934, the Jesuit Francis X. Talbot vehemently decried Judge Woolsey's recent decision that Ulysses was not obscene, adding, \"Only a person who had been a Catholic, only one with an incurably diseased mind, could be so diabolically venomous toward God, toward the Blessed Sacrament, toward the Virgin Mary.\"In his review in The Outlook, Arnold Bennett expressed his lack of admiration for Joyce detailing one day in 700 pages. He wrote, \"Given sufficient time, paper, childish caprice, and obstinacy, one might easily write over seven thousand pages about twenty hours of life.\" Bennett also opposed Val\u00e9ry Larbaud's view that Joyce elaborately planned and organized the day he wrote about. Bennett wrote, \"[Joyce] apparently thinks there is something truly artistic and high minded in playing the lout to the innocent and defenseless reader. As a fact, there isn't\u2026After all, to comprehend Ulysses is not among the recognized learned professions, and nobody should give his entire existence to the job.\" Bennett acknowledged that Joyce's \"verbal method can be justified\" since he is \"trying to reproduce the thoughts of personage\", but called the details \"trivial and perfectly futile in the narrative\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

Michael Farr, author of Tintin: The Complete Companion, stated that in The Castafiore Emerald, Herg\u00e9 permits Haddock to remain at home in Marlinspike, an ideal that the \"increasingly travel weary\" character had long cherished, further stating that if Herg\u00e9 had decided to end the Tintin series, The Castafiore Emerald would have been \"a suitable final volume\". He compared the story to the detective novels by Agatha Christie, in that the narrative was \"littered from start to finish with clues, most of which are false\", misleading both Tintin and the reader. He felt that in setting the story entirely at Marlinspike, Herg\u00e9 \"deliberately broke the classic adventure mould he had created\", and in doing so \"succeeded in creating a masterpiece in the manner of a well constructed stage comedy or farce\". Farr viewed the volume as \"a tour de force\", noting that it was quite dissimilar to any other instalment in The Adventures of Tintin. As such, he felt that it would have been a suitable story on which to end the series. As a result of its \"experimental, exceptional nature\", Farr believed that The Castafiore Emerald \"never gained the public recognition it merits\", stating that while attracting \"a loyal following\" it had not become one of the most popular Adventures of Tintin, something that he thought was \"unjust\".Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier, co-authors of the book, The Pocket Essential Tintin, described Herg\u00e9's depiction of Castafiore in the story as \"a force of nature\", praising the way that he depicted her many outfit changes. They described Mr Bolt as being both a \"Godot-like character\" and as being akin to Basil Fawlty from the British sitcom Fawlty Towers, while adding that the broken step acts \"like a Greek God's curse\" in the story that affects everyone except Castafiore.\nThey interpreted The Castafiore Emerald as Herg\u00e9's Nouveau Roman, in which he realises that he cannot improve upon the standard set in Tintin in Tibet and thus decides to \"deconstruct his own myth and create the antithesis of a Tintin adventure\". Given that accidents and bad luck befall most of the characters in the story, Lofficier and Lofficier described the story as \"a comedy of errors, a wonderful tribute to Murphy's Law\". Ultimately, they awarded the story four stars out of five.\nEnglish screenwriter and author of Tintin: Herg\u00e9 and his Creation (1991), Harry Thompson stated that in The Castafiore Emerald, \"everything is topsy-turvy\", with obvious villains being shown to be harmless, and alleged crimes turning out to have not happened. He thought that Haddock was a clear parallel for Herg\u00e9 himself in the story, representing his own desires and frustrations. Ultimately, he considered the volume to be \"Herg\u00e9's masterpiece\" when it came to technical issues, representing \"the high tide of his creative abilities\".Herg\u00e9 biographer Beno\u00eet Peeters described the story as \"the most surprising of Tintin's adventures\", with Herg\u00e9 having been \"determined to push his reexamination of the comic strip even further\". He noted that in the story, Castafiore's \"dramatic femininity\" disrupted the \"idea of sociability\" that pervaded Marlinspike, with its \"proper respect of space, a form of harmony in independence\".  He added that \"this casually alluring tale is one of the most subtly handled of the adventures; a riot of clues, both real and false, give The Castafiore Emerald an unequaled density\", elsewhere referring to it as \"a catalogue of mishaps with nothing or no one spared\".\nHe described it as having brought to the foreground the \"anarchist and non-conformist tendencies of Herg\u00e9's work\" which had previously been shown in Quick & Flupke.\nHe also saw the book as being \"a sort of flashback\" for Herg\u00e9, allowing him to relive events from his own past; thus, Peeters thought that the constant renovations at Marlinspike represented the constant renovations at Herg\u00e9's country home of C\u00e9roux-Mousty, while Haddock's time in the wheelchair represented his former wife's Germaine time spent similarly disabled, and Castafiore was a parody of Germaine herself. Ultimately, he felt that the story \u2013 \"the last great adventure of Tintin\" \u2013 was \"also a swan song\", for Herg\u00e9 \"did not dare to continue down this path, where not all of his readers had followed him\", and which had represented \"a permanent loss of innocence\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

The \"single most important source used by Geoffrey of Monmouth in his pseudohistorical Historia Regum Britanniae\" and through the enormous popularity of the latter work, this version of the early history of Britain, including the Trojan origin tradition, was incorporated into subsequent chronicles of the long-running history of the land, such as the Middle English Brut of England, also known as The Chronicles of England.\nThe work was the first source to portray King Arthur, who is described as a dux bellorum ('military leader') or miles ('warrior, soldier') and not as a king. It names the twelve battles that Arthur fought, but, unlike the Annales Cambriae, does not give any actual dates.\nThe reference in the Historia Brittonum to Arthur carrying the image of St. Mary on his shoulders in a battle has been interpreted by later commentators as a mistranslation of Arthur bearing the image of Mary on his shield; the words in Welsh are very similar.The 19th-century classicist Theodor Mommsen divided the work into seven parts: Preface (Prefatio Nennii Britonum); I. The Six Ages of the World (de sex aetatibus mundi) (\u00a71-6); II. History of the Britons (historia Brittonum) (\u00a77-49); III. Life of Patrick (vita Patricii) (\u00a750-55); IV.

Wonders of Britain (de mirabilibus Britanniae) (\u00a767\u201476).\nThe Historia Brittonum can be dated to about 829. The work was written no earlier than the \"fourth year of [the reign of] king Mermenus\" (who has been identified as Merfyn Frych ap Gwriad, king of Gwynedd). Historians have conservatively assigned 828 to the earliest date for the work, which is consistent with the statement in chapter 4 that \"from the Passion of Christ 796 years have passed. But from his Incarnation are 831 years\".The text makes use of two narrative techniques that are generally considered not reliable by modern academic standards: synthesizing and synchronizing history. Synthetic history combines legendary elements with fact, which makes the veracity of the text challenging to evaluate. Various specious causal connections and attempts to synchronize material from different sources and traditions also contribute to undermining the reliability of the chronicle.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He took particular interest in the country's castles and folklore, explaining later that he was \"always interested in mythology.\" Alexander later described his experiences in Wales as \"part of the raw material for the Prydain books.\"The magical land Prydain's geography is loosely based on Wales. Ynys M\u00f4n, the Welsh name for the Isle of Anglesey, became the Isle of Mona. The word Prydain itself is the Welsh name of Britain.\nThe stories draw on themes, ideas, and culture inspired by Welsh folklore, particularly the stories collected in the Mabinogion. According to Alexander, nearly all of the proper names in Prydain are from Welsh myth or history, with the exceptions of Eilonwy and Taran. The author's note in the first novel, The Book of Three, points out the Prydain stories and characters are his own and not simply retellings of old folklore, adding that students of Welsh culture should be prepared to see familiar names such as Arawn and Gwydion attached to characters who act very differently from their mythological namesakes. In the author's note for The Castle of Lyr, Alexander said The Prydain Chronicles are meant to communicate \"the feeling, not the fact, of the land of Wales and its legends.\" In the author's note for The High King, Alexander said of the series, \"While it grew from Welsh legend, it has broadened into my attempt to make a land of fantasy relevant to the world of reality.\"Originally, Alexander planned to write only one or two Prydain novels, \"three at the very most.\" At one point, the plan was for a trilogy of books that would be entitled The Battle of the Trees, The Lion with the Steady Hand, and Little Gwion. By 1965, a four novel series was planned with new titles. The first novel, The Book of Three, was released by Holt and Company in 1964, followed by The Black Cauldron in 1965, and The Castle of Lyr in 1966. Originally, the fourth novel was meant to be titled The High King of Prydain. But as Alexander finished The Castle of Lyr, an editor remarked that it felt as if some material was missing between the third and fourth volumes. To act as a bridge between the two and show more of Taran's journey to maturity, Alexander started writing a new novel Taran Wanderer, finishing it one month after The Castle of Llyr was published in 1966. The new book Taran Wanderer was published in 1967. The next novel, entitled The High King, was published in 1968, concluding the now five-volume series. The High King included a map illustrated by Evaline Ness, who also did the cover art for the original novel editions.While writing the series, Lloyd Alexander also published short stories taking place in Prydain, occurring before the events of the novels. This included Coll and His White Pig (1965) and The Truthful Harp (1967), both being 32-page picture books illustrated by Evaline Ness.The Foundling and Other Tales of Prydain was published in 1973 as a collection of six new short stories of Prydain, illustrated by Margot Zemach, with a reproduction of a map from The High King illustrated by Evaline Ness. It was dedicated to \"Friends of Prydain, who promised to read more if I would write more.\" In the collection, Alexander remarked \"popular demand makes a splendid pretext\" for a return to the fictional world of Prydain but not for covering the same ground, hence his decision to make the stories prequels.\nThe Prydain Chronicles Omnibus (1991) comprises the five novels and the material of the original edition of The Foundling, but not the stories of the first two illustrated picture books.In 1999, Holt and Company published an expanded edition of The Foundling that included the original book's material while adding the short stories (but not the illustrations) of Coll and his White Pig and The Truthful Harp, along with a new \"Prydain Pronunciation Guide\" with entries for 49 proper names. The Pronunciation Guide was included in later editions of the main five novels, as was Ness's map.In 1999, Alexander explained to Scholastic students: \"The High King was the final logical development of the first four books in the Prydain Chronicles. It was not an easy book to write, but at least I was building on a foundation that I had already made. I never considered a different ending...\" He added that after writing The Chronicles of Prydain for seven years, \"the characters were as close to me as my own family...

The book is the sailor Ishmael's narrative of the maniacal quest of Ahab, captain of the whaling ship Pequod, for vengeance against Moby Dick, the giant white sperm whale that bit off his leg on the ship's previous voyage. A contribution to the literature of the American Renaissance, Moby-Dick was published to mixed reviews, was a commercial failure, and was out of print at the time of the author's death in 1891. Its reputation as a Great American Novel was established only in the 20th century, after the 1919 centennial of its author's birth. William Faulkner said he wished he had written the book himself, and D. H. Lawrence called it \"one of the strangest and most wonderful books in the world\" and \"the greatest book of the sea ever written\". Its opening sentence, \"Call me Ishmael\", is among world literature's most famous.Melville began writing Moby-Dick in February 1850 and finished 18 months later, a year after he had anticipated. Melville drew on his experience as a common sailor from 1841 to 1844, including on whalers, and on wide reading in whaling literature. The white whale is modeled on a notoriously hard-to-catch albino whale Mocha Dick, and the book's ending is based on the sinking of the whaleship Essex in 1820. The detailed and realistic descriptions of whale hunting and of extracting whale oil, as well as life aboard ship among a culturally diverse crew, are mixed with exploration of class and social status, good and evil, and the existence of God. The book's literary influences include Shakespeare, Carlyle and the Bible. In addition to narrative prose, Melville uses styles and literary devices ranging from songs, poetry, and catalogs to Shakespearean stage directions, soliloquies, and asides. In August 1850, with the manuscript perhaps half finished, he met Nathaniel Hawthorne and was deeply impressed by his Mosses from an Old Manse, which he compared to Shakespeare in its cosmic ambitions. This encounter may have inspired him to revise and deepen Moby-Dick, which is dedicated to Hawthorne, \"in token of my admiration for his genius\".\nThe book was first published (in three volumes) as The Whale in London in October 1851, and under its definitive title, Moby-Dick; or, The Whale,  in a single-volume edition in New York in November. The London publisher, Richard Bentley, censored or changed sensitive passages; Melville made revisions as well, including a last-minute change of the title for the New York edition. The whale, however, appears in the text of both editions as \"Moby Dick\", without the hyphen. Reviewers in Britain were largely favorable, though some objected that the tale seemed to be told by a narrator who perished with the ship, as the British edition lacked the epilogue recounting Ishmael's survival.

Facsimiles of the originals can be found in the online Biodiversity Heritage Library (Vol.1) and Vol 2).\nThe author was the French botanist Jacques Labillardi\u00e8re, who visited the region in 1792 with the d'Entrecasteaux expedition. Published between 1804 and 1806, it is one of the earliest works to describe the plants of the continent; according to Denis and Maisie Carr, \"[i]n practical terms, this was the first general flora of Australia.\"The work describes the botanical collections made by himself and his companion on the d'Entrecasteaux expedition, Charles Riche, and the unattributed and later collections of Nicolas Baudin's expedition. Labillardi\u00e8re's collections were seized by the English, but were returned to him in France at the intervention of Joseph Banks. He made his collections at Observatory Island and other locations at the Archipelago of the Recherche. Extensive collection were also made at Recherche Bay, during his two visits to Tasmania.\nThe preface describes the journey \"from Cape of Good Hope to Australia\", an example of the continent being named as 'Australia' before its popularisation by Flinders' use in A Voyage to Terra Australis. The work includes 256 black-and-white botanical illustrations, including contributions by Pierre-Joseph Redout\u00e9. Copper plates drawn by Pierre Antoine Poiteau and engraved by Auguste Pl\u00e9e were produced for other illustrations.Labillardi\u00e8re had named and described more Australian flora than any other botanist of the day; the work was the most comprehensive until Robert Brown published his Prodromus. This work featured the first descriptions of Cephalotus follicularis, a carnivorous plant, and species Adenanthos obovatus and Gahnia trifida from the southern coast. The collections made at southwest Australia also produced new genera Adenanthos (Proteaceae) and Calytrix (Myrtaceae), species Astartea fascicularis, Hakea clavata and Taxandria marginata, and the first description of the now widely introduced Acacia saligna.  Tasmanian species include Eucryphia lucida (leatherwood) and Phyllocladus aspleniifolius (celery-top pine). The first confirmed collection of Australian bryophytes are described and illustrated by the author; the current name for these species are the mosses Cyathophorum bulbosum and Hypnodendron comosum and a liverwort Hymenophyton flabellatum.Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen has been praised for the accuracy of its descriptions and for the elegant scientific names coined therein. It has been criticised for its imprecision and occasional errors in collection locality and habitat; for example it attributes the collection of Eucalyptus ovata to southwest Australia, but it occurs only in Tasmania and southeast Australia. Labillardi\u00e8re has also been criticised for publishing species based upon specimens collected by other botanists, without providing attribution or acknowledgement for the specimens.The standard abbreviation for the work, Nov. Holl. Pl., is used in botanical literature, and is also known by the title Specimens of the Plants of New Holland. It is the second publication by Labillardi\u00e8re to describe Australian flora; the first was Relation du Voyage \u00e0 la Recherche de la P\u00e9rouse in 1799, a popular account of the voyage in search of the La P\u00e9rouse expedition.

Being a Ghost Story of Christmas, commonly known as A Christmas Carol, is a novella by Charles Dickens, first published in London by Chapman & Hall in 1843 and illustrated by John Leech. It recounts the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, an elderly miser who is visited by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley and the spirits of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come. In the process, Scrooge is transformed into a kinder, gentler man.\nDickens wrote A Christmas Carol during a period when the British were exploring and re-evaluating past Christmas traditions, including carols, and newer customs such as cards and Christmas trees. He was influenced by the experiences of his own youth and by the Christmas stories of other authors, including Washington Irving and Douglas Jerrold. Dickens had written three Christmas stories prior to the novella, and was inspired following a visit to the Field Lane Ragged School, one of several establishments for London's street children. The treatment of the poor and the ability of a selfish man to redeem himself by transforming into a more sympathetic character  are the key themes of the story. There is discussion among academics as to whether this is a fully secular story, or if it is a Christian allegory.\nPublished on 19 December, the first edition sold out by Christmas Eve; by the end of 1844 thirteen editions had been released. Most critics reviewed the novella favourably. The story was illicitly copied in January 1844; Dickens took legal action against the publishers, who went bankrupt, further reducing Dickens's small profits from the publication. He subsequently wrote four other Christmas stories. In 1849 he began public readings of the story, which proved so successful he undertook 127 further performances until 1870, the year of his death. A Christmas Carol has never been out of print and has been translated into several languages; the story has been adapted many times for film, stage, opera and other media.\nA Christmas Carol captured the zeitgeist of the early Victorian revival of the Christmas holiday.

Since Fleming's death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelisations: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd, and Anthony Horowitz. The latest novel is With a Mind to Kill by Anthony Horowitz, published in May 2022. Additionally Charlie Higson wrote a series on a young James Bond, and Kate Westbrook wrote three novels based on the diaries of a recurring series character, Moneypenny.\nThe character\u2014also known by the code number 007 (pronounced \"double-oh-seven\")\u2014has also been adapted for television, radio, comic strip, video games and film. The films are one of the longest continually running film series and have grossed over US$7.04 billion in total at the box office, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film series to date, which started in 1962 with Dr. No, starring Sean Connery as Bond. As of 2021, there have been twenty-five films in the Eon Productions series. The most recent Bond film, No Time to Die (2021), stars Daniel Craig in his fifth portrayal of Bond; he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series. There have also been two independent Bond film productions: Casino Royale (a 1967 spoof starring David Niven) and Never Say Never Again (a 1983 remake of an earlier Eon-produced film, 1965's Thunderball, both starring Connery). In 2015, the series was estimated to be worth $19.9 billion in total (based on box-office grosses, DVD sales and merchandise tie-ins), making James Bond one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. Casino Royale has also been adapted for television, as a one-hour show in 1954 as part of the CBS series Climax!.\nThe Bond films are renowned for a number of features, including their soundtracks, with the theme songs having received Academy Award nominations on several occasions, and three wins. Other important elements which run through most of the films include Bond's cars, his guns, and the gadgets with which he is supplied by Q Branch. The films are also noted for Bond's relationships with various women, who are popularly referred to as \"Bond girls\".", "hasanswer": true}]}
{"id": "50_608", "question": "Who is the author of Harmonium?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_21162", "text": "Poet and editor Harriet Monroe, who founded Poetry magazine in 1912, wrote in 1924,\n\n[T]here was never a more flavorously original poetic personality than the author of this book. If one seeks sheer beauty of sound, phrase, rhythm, packed with prismatically colored ideas by a mind at once wise and whimsical, one should open one's eyes and ears, sharpen one's wits, widen one's sympathies to include rare and exquisite aspects of life, and then run for this volume of iridescent poems.\n\nThe poet Marianne Moore, Stevens' lifelong ally and friend, wrote shortly after the book's publication of Stevens' \"achieved remoteness\" of imagination, likening the poems to a painting that Tu Muh commented upon:\n\nPowerful is the painting... and high is it hung on the spotless wall in the lofty hall of your mansion.\"\n\n\"Sea Surface Full of Clouds\" illustrates this quality. Although Joan Richardson's reading makes the case that the poem's \"true subject\" is an extended holiday that Stevens and his wife, Elsie, took in the fall of 1923, and specifically that the true subject is the poet's sexuality, rather it is the powerful \"poetry of the subject\" that displays Stevens' genius and draws readers to the poem, as Tu Muh was drawn to the painting.\nMoore casts Stevens as an explorer of the exotic who takes refuge in a \"riot of gorgeousness\". She adds that although \"Mr. Stevens is never inadvertently crude, one is conscious...of a deliberate bearishness\u2014a shadow of acrimonious, unprovoked contumely.\" Stevens seems to admit as much in \"The Weeping Burgher\". \"The Death of a Soldier\" may have been one of the poems she had in mind, because of its almost brutal naturalism.\nEdmund Wilson, writing in The New Republic in 1924, spoke without pretence for most readers of Stevens: \"Even when you do not know what he is saying, you know that he is saying it well\". This 'Wilson effect' is no doubt linked to Stevens' Adagia aphorism, \"Poetry must resist the intelligence almost successfully\". \"Colloquy with a Polish Aunt\" is a good candidate for a Wilson award.Matthew Josephson ranked Stevens among the best of contemporary poets, writing in 1923 that Stevens exhibits both a poetry of sensuousness and a metaphysical poetry. He favors the latter, as in \"Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird\" and \"Anecdote of the Jar\", predicting that they will be \"spell-binding for hundreds of years\". By contrast Charles Altieri has recently expressed a preference for the poetry of sensuousness. Stevens matters as a poet, according to Altieri, because of his commitment to the primacy of the senses. \"Disillusionment of Ten O'Clock\", which peppers the reader with visual images, would serve as a simple example, \"Sea Surface Full of Clouds\" as more complex.\nThe Imagist poet and critic John Gould Fletcher wrote in 1923 that because of his honesty Stevens stands \"head and shoulders\" above the internationally famous aesthetes like Eliot, the Sitwells, and Val\u00e9ry. He defended Stevens' \"obscurity\" as deriving from \"a wealth of meaning and allusion\". He discerned a poet \"definitely out of tune with life and with his surroundings, and...seeking an escape into a sphere of finer harmony between instinct and intelligence\". \"The Wind Shifts\" is one poem that supports Fletcher's reading. He warned that Stevens faced \"a clear choice of evils: he must either expand his range to take in more of human experience, or give up writing altogether. Harmonium is a sublimation which does not permit a sequel.\" Stevens seems to have grasped both horns of the dilemma, writing little for several years after Harmonium and then returning with Ideas of Order and subsequent collections that emphasize what Fletcher would classify as metaphysical poetry. Buttel prefers to view the later work as \"a kind of exfoliation\" of his earlier style, the later poems \"adumbrated\" in Harmonium. Stevens' first idea for the title of The Collected Poems was The Whole of Harmonium.)\nLouis Untermeyer, suspicious of international influences on American poetry, criticized Stevens in 1924 as a \"conscious aesthete\" at war with reality, achieving little beyond \"an amusing precosity\". He can only \"smile indulgently\" at the \"childish\" love of alliteration and assonance in \"Chieftain Iffucan of Azcan in caftan\" or \"Gloomy grammarians in golden gowns\", and he is irritated by the confusing titles: \"The Emperor of Ice Cream\", \"The Paltry Nude Starts on a Spring Voyage\", \"Frogs Eat Butterflies. Snakes Eat Frogs. Hogs Eat Snakes. Men Eat Hogs\". On the evidence of the exquisite miniature \"Tea\", Alfred Kreymberg had been led to expect a \"slender, ethereal being, shy and sensitive\", according to Milton Bates, who continues, \"the poet he actually met at a social gathering for Rogue contributors stood over six feet tall and weighed over two hundred pounds\".To the caricature of \"aesthete\" Gorham Munson added \"dandy\" in \"The Dandyism of Wallace Stevens\", objecting to what he took to be Stevens' indifference to political and social issues of the era. Munson was impressed by the influence of French: \"The whole tendency of his vocabulary is, in fact, toward the lightness and coolness and transparency of French.\" In view of suspicions about international influences at that time, this may have been unfortunate praise. However, Stevens would have accepted it, having written in Adagia, \"French and English constitute a single language\".The epithet \"dandy\" became \"hedonist\" in Yvor Winters's 1943 essay \"Wallace Stevens, or the Hedonist's Progress\", which objected that Stevens did not give primacy to the intellect or to orthodox Christian beliefs.  Winters characterized Stevens as \"a cool master\", in an essay with that title, in which he describes Stevens as \"this greatest of living and of American poets\".Possibly the most disgruntled reader of Stevens' early poems was the Irish-American poet Shaemas O'Scheel, the author of an Irish war poem, \"They Went Forth to Battle, But They Always Fell\". Reviewing Stevens' poems that appeared in the \"War Number\" (November 1914) of the journal Poetry, O\u2019Sheel, writing in a competing journal, condemned the entire \"War Number\" but cited Stevens' \"Phases\" in particular as \"an excellent example\" of poetry that is \"untruthful, and nauseating to read\".Favoring Harmonium's \"sensualism\", as exampled in \"Metaphors of a Magnifico\", marks a divide among critics, for there are many who, like Helen Vendler, champion the later poetry. \"I think, with others, that Stevens' powers increased with age\", she writes.Josephson chooses these lines from \"Banal Sojourn\" to illustrate Stevens' poetry of sensuousness:\n\nJosephson's objection to this side of Stevens is that he in his next book \"would have to be more and more intimate and scandalous,\nad absurdum\", and that already this side \"has influenced many of his younger contemporaries, and in them, at least, leads to pretense, and murkiness\".There are those who maintain that both the aesthete and sensualist readings overlook the American burgher in Stevens, the successful insurance executive possessed of \"something of the mountainous gruffness that we recognize in ourselves as American\u2014the stamina, the powerful grain showing in a kind of indifference\". This character trait may be reflected in the element of anti-poetry in Stevens' work, as in his choice of the word 'stupid' in \"Hibiscus on the Sleeping Shores\", or the \"tink and tank and tunk-a-tunk-tunk\" of \"A High-Toned Old Christian Woman\".\n\"There are in Stevens many moments rich in beauty\", Robert Rehder writes, \"but he does not want them to be too sweet and resists 'the bawds of euphony'\". Stevens' fondness for American locale helps him temper many such moments.\nA poem like \"The Jack-Rabbit\" illustrates his affection for rural and frontier America and the native folk tradition, leaving no doubt that his poetry is rooted in America. Poems like \"Ploughing on Sunday\", \"The Doctor of Geneva\" and \"Bantam in Pine-Woods\" are an implicit tribute to Walt Whitman and other American poets, including himself, making evident his pride in the poetic revolution taking place on the North American continent. Indian names are another aspect of Stevens' Americana, as in the title of \"Stars at Tallapoosa\". Movement away from European influences and toward the responsibility of writing distinctly American poetry may be traced to \"Anecdote of the Jar\" (1919).\n\nBates suggests that Stevens the American burgher was self-conscious about the poses of aesthete and dandy, writing, It is as though Stevens, having assumed the pose of aesthete, had suddenly caught sight of himself in a mirror; thereafter, his dismay and amusement became an integral part of the pose. The same might be said of his dandiacal poems, for the dandy is by definition someone who lives always as though reflected in a mirror; the dandy's vaunted wit sprang in the first place from an awareness of his own absurd pretensions. Further compounding the aesthetic dandy's self-consciousness, in Stevens' case, was his burgherly sense of his own foppish creations. Allen Tate suggests a different interpretation in maintaining that Stevens' dandyism was \"the perfect surface beneath which plays an intense Puritanism\". The burgher does not look on with ironic dismay but rather uses the poses to achieve reticence about self-disclosure. The poses allow modulation in revelation of the poet and his world. Tony Sharpe expresses a similar thought when he refers to Stevens as \"that exponent of American loneliness\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

The \"Great Mongol\" or Demotte Shahnameh, produced during the reign of the Ilkhanid Sultan Abu Sa'id, is one of the most illustrative and important copies of the Shahnameh.The Timurids continued the tradition of manuscript production.

Shah Ismail I used the epic for propaganda purposes: as a gesture of Persian patriotism, as a celebration of renewed Persian rule, and as a reassertion of Persian royal authority. The Safavids commissioned elaborate copies of the Shahnameh to support their legitimacy. Among the high points of Shahnameh illustrations was the series of 250 miniatures commissioned by Shah Ismail for his son's Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp.

(Much of the writing was done at Loughry Manor in Cookstown, County Tyrone, whilst Swift stayed there.) Some sources suggest as early as 1713 when Swift, Gay, Pope, Arbuthnot and others formed the Scriblerus Club with the aim of satirising popular literary genres. According to these accounts, Swift was charged with writing the memoirs of the club's imaginary author, Martinus Scriblerus, and also with satirising the \"travellers' tales\" literary subgenre. It is known from Swift's correspondence that the composition proper began in 1720 with the mirror-themed Parts I and II written first, Part IV next in 1723 and Part III written in 1724; but amendments were made even while Swift was writing Drapier's Letters. By August 1725 the book was complete; and as Gulliver's Travels was a transparently anti-Whig satire, it is likely that Swift had the manuscript copied so that his handwriting could not be used as evidence if a prosecution should arise, as had happened in the case of some of his Irish pamphlets (the Drapier's Letters). In March 1726 Swift travelled to London to have his work published; the manuscript was secretly delivered to the publisher Benjamin Motte, who used five printing houses to speed production and avoid piracy. Motte, recognising a best-seller but fearing prosecution, cut or altered the worst offending passages (such as the descriptions of the court contests in Lilliput and the rebellion of Lindalino), added some material in defence of Queen Anne to Part II, and published it. The first edition was released in two volumes on 28 October 1726, priced at 8s. 6d.Motte published Gulliver's Travels anonymously, and as was often the way with fashionable works, several follow-ups (Memoirs of the Court of Lilliput), parodies (Two Lilliputian Odes, The first on the Famous Engine With Which Captain Gulliver extinguish'd the Palace Fire...) and \"keys\" (Gulliver Decipher'd and Lemuel Gulliver's Travels into Several Remote Regions of the World Compendiously Methodiz'd, the second by Edmund Curll who had similarly written a \"key\" to Swift's Tale of a Tub in 1705) were swiftly produced. These were mostly printed anonymously (or occasionally pseudonymously) and were quickly forgotten. Swift had nothing to do with them and disavowed them in Faulkner's edition of 1735.

{"id": "50_626", "question": "Who is the author of The Tempest?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_21266", "text": "The Tempest first appeared in print in 1623 in the collection of 36 of Shakespeare's plays entitled, Mr. William Shakespeare's Comedies, Histories, & Tragedies; Published according to the True and Original Copies, which is known as the First Folio. The plays, including The Tempest, were gathered and edited by John Heminges and Henry Condell.A handwritten manuscript of The Tempest was prepared by Ralph Crane, a scrivener employed by the King's Men. (A scrivener is one who has a talent and is practiced at using a quill pen and ink to create legible manuscripts.) Crane probably copied from Shakespeare's rough draft, and based his style on Ben Jonson's Folio of 1616. Crane is thought to have neatened texts, edited the divisions of acts and scenes, and sometimes added his own improvements. He was fond of joining words with hyphens, and using elisions with apostrophes, for example by changing \"with the king\" to read: \"w'th' King\". The elaborate stage directions in The Tempest may have been due to Crane; they provide evidence regarding how the play was staged by the King's Company.The entire First Folio project was delivered to the blind printer, William Jaggard, and printing began in 1622. The Tempest is the first play in the publication. It was proofread and printed with special care; it is the most well-printed and the cleanest text of the thirty-six plays. To do the work of setting the type in the printing press, three compositors were used for The Tempest. In the 1960s, a landmark bibliographic study of the First Folio was accomplished by Charlton Hinman. Based on distinctive quirks in the printed words on the page, the study was able to individuate the compositors, and reveal that three compositors worked on The Tempest, who are known as Compositor B, C, and F. Compositor B worked on The Tempest's first page as well as six other pages. He was an experienced journeyman in Jaggard's printshop, who occasionally could be careless. He also was fond of dashes and colons, where modern editions use commas. In his role, he may have had a responsibility for the entire First Folio. The other two, Compositors C and F, worked full-time and were experienced printers.At the time, spelling and punctuation was not standardized and will vary from page to page, because each compositor had their individual preferences and styles. There is evidence that the press run was stopped at least four times, which allowed proofreading and corrections. However, a page with an error would not be discarded, so pages late in any given press run would be the most accurate, and each of the final printed folios may vary in this regard. This is the common practice at the time. There is also an instance of a letter (a metal sort or a type) being damaged (possibly) during the course of a run and changing the meaning of a word: After the masque Ferdinand says,\n\nThe word \"wise\" at the end of line 123 was printed with the traditional long \"s\" that resembles an \"f\". But in 1978 it was suggested that during the press run, a small piece of the crossbar on the type had broken off, and the word should be \"wife\". Modern editors have not come to an agreement\u2014Oxford says \"wife\", Arden says \"wise\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is widely considered the pre-eminent work in Italian literature and one of the greatest works of Western literature. The poem's imaginative vision of the afterlife is representative of the medieval worldview as it existed in the Western Church by the 14th century. It helped establish the Tuscan language, in which it is written, as the standardized Italian language. It is divided into three parts: Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso.\nThe poem discusses \"the state of the soul after death and presents an image of divine justice meted out as due punishment or reward\", and describes Dante's travels through Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven. Allegorically, the poem represents the soul's journey towards God, beginning with the recognition and rejection of sin (Inferno), followed by the penitent Christian life (Purgatorio), which is then followed by the soul's ascent to God (Paradiso). Dante draws on medieval Catholic theology and philosophy, especially Thomistic philosophy derived from the Summa Theologica of Thomas Aquinas. Consequently, the Divine Comedy has been called \"the Summa in verse\".In the poem, the pilgrim Dante is accompanied by three guides: Virgil, who represents human reason, and who guides him for all of Inferno and most of Purgatorio; Beatrice, who represents divine revelation in addition to theology, grace, and faith; and guides him from the end of Purgatorio onwards; and Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, who represents contemplative mysticism and devotion to Mary the Mother, guiding him in the final cantos of Paradiso.The work was originally simply titled Comed\u00eca (pronounced [kome\u02c8di\u02d0a], Tuscan for \"Comedy\") \u2013 so also in the first printed edition, published in 1472 \u2013 later adjusted to the modern Italian Commedia. The adjective Divina was added by Giovanni Boccaccio, owing to its subject matter and lofty style, and the first edition to name the poem Divina Comedia in the title was that of the Venetian humanist Lodovico Dolce, published in 1555 by Gabriele Giolito de' Ferrari.\nErich Auerbach said Dante was the first writer to depict human beings as the products of a specific time, place and circumstance, as opposed to mythic archetypes or a collection of vices and virtues, concluding that this, along with the fully imagined world of the Divine Comedy, suggests that the Divine Comedy inaugurated realism and self-portraiture in modern fiction.", "hasanswer": true}]}

This small publication contained some spurious content falsely ascribed to Shakespeare; it also contained four sonnets that can be said to be by Shakespeare: Two of the four appear to be early versions of sonnets that were later published in the 1609 quarto (numbers 138 and 144); the other two were sonnets lifted from Shakespeare's play Love's Labour's Lost. Sonnets 138 and 144 are anything but the sweet sonnets hinted at by Francis Meres' comment. They are instead harshly frank, ironic and recriminative regarding the relationship of the speaker and the Dark Lady. The two sonnets that were taken from Love's Labour's Lost, were, in the context of the play, written by comic characters who were intended to be seen as amateur sonneteers.

Thomas Heywood protests this piracy in his Apology for Actors (1612), writing that Shakespeare was \"much offended\" with Jaggard for making \"so bold with his name.\" Jaggard withdraws the attribution to Shakespeare from unsold copies of the 1612 edition.\n1640 \u2013 The publisher John Benson publishes an anthology of poems; some are by Shakespeare, and about 30 are not, but all are ascribed to Shakespeare. It is titled \"Poems: Written by Wil. Shakespeare Gent\". Benson is even more wildly piratical than Jaggard. Benson draws on The Passionate Pilgrim and other sources, including Shakespeare's Sonnets (1609), which he rewrites and rearranges. Benson imperfectly rewrites the sonnets to make them appear to be addressing a woman\u2014the pronoun \"he\" is often replaced by \"she\". This edition is unfortunately influential and resulted in confusing and confounding various critical understanding and response for more than a century. Deliberate misgendering is also a feature of 17th-century commonplace books which include Sonnet 2, the most popular sonnet to appear in such collections.

He first majored in chemical engineering, then switched to English, but contrary to common belief he did not graduate. On a bet, Weinbaum took an exam for a friend, and was later discovered; he left the university in 1923.\nWeinbaum is best known for his groundbreaking science fiction short story \"A Martian Odyssey\", which presents a sympathetic but decidedly non-human alien, Tweel. This was his first science fiction story: in 1933 he had sold a romantic novel, The Lady Dances, to King Features Syndicate, which serialized the story in its newspapers in early 1934. Isaac Asimov described \"A Martian Odyssey\" as \"a perfect Campbellian science fiction story, before John W. Campbell. Indeed, Tweel may be the first creature in science fiction to fulfil Campbell's dictum, 'write me a creature who thinks as well as a man, or better than a man, but not like a man'.\" Asimov went on to describe it as one of only three stories that changed the way all subsequent stories in the science fiction genre have been written. It was the oldest short story and one of the top vote-getters selected by the Science Fiction Writers of America for inclusion in The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 1929\u20131964.\nMost of the work that was published in Weinbaum's lifetime appeared in either Astounding or Wonder Stories. However, several of his pieces first appeared in the early science fiction fanzine Fantasy Magazine (successor to Science Fiction Digest) in the 1930s, including an \"Auto-Biographical Sketch\" in the June 1935 issue.  Despite common belief, Weinbaum was not one of the contributors to the multi-authored Cosmos serial in Science Fiction Digest/Fantasy Magazine. He did contribute to the multi-author story \"The Challenge From Beyond\", published in the September 1935 Fantasy Magazine. \nAt the time of his death, Weinbaum was writing a novel, Three Who Danced. In this novel, the Prince of Wales is unexpectedly present at a dance in an obscure American community, where he dances with three of the local girls, choosing each for a different reason. Each girl's life is changed, happily or tragically, as a result of the unexpected attention she has received. \nIn 1993, Weinbaum's widow, Margaret Hawtof Kay, donated his papers to the Temple University Library in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Included were several unpublished manuscripts, among them Three Who Danced, as well as other unpublished stories. These are mostly romance stories, but there are also a few other non-fiction and fiction writings, none of them science fiction.\nA film version of Weinbaum's short story \"The Adaptive Ultimate\" was released in 1957 under the title She Devil, starring Mari Blanchard, Jack Kelly, and Albert Dekker. The story was also dramatized for television as an episode of Studio One titled \"Kyra Zelas\" (the name of the title character), broadcast on September 12, 1949.

Even after the decline of the Roman Empire, it \"remained central to a Latin education\". In Latin-Christian culture, the Aeneid was one of the canonical texts, subjected to commentary as a philological and educational study, with the most complete commentary having been written by the 4th-century grammarian Maurus Servius Honoratus. It was widely held to be the pinnacle of Latin literature, much in the same way that the Iliad was seen to be supreme in Greek literature.\nThe strong influence of the Aeneid has been identified in the development of European vernacular literatures\u2014some English works that show its influence being Beowulf, Layamon's Brut (through the source text Historia Regum Britanniae), The Faerie Queene, and Milton's Paradise Lost. The Italian poet Dante Alighieri was himself profoundly influenced by the Aeneid, so much so that his magnum opus The Divine Comedy, itself widely considered central to the western canon, includes a number of quotations from and allusions to the Aeneid and features the author Virgil as a major character\u2014the guide of Dante through the realms of the Inferno and Purgatorio. Another continental work displaying the influence of the Aeneid is the 16th-century Portuguese epic Os Lus\u00edadas, written by Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es and dealing with Vasco da Gama's voyage to India.\nThe importance of Latin education itself was paramount in Western culture: \"from 1600 to 1900, the Latin school was at the centre of European education, wherever it was found\"; within that Latin school, Virgil was taught at the advanced level and, in 19th-century England, special editions of Virgil were awarded to students who distinguished themselves. In the United States, Virgil and specifically the Aeneid were taught in the fourth year of a Latin sequence, at least until the 1960s; the current (2011) Advanced Placement curriculum in Latin continues to assign a central position to the poem: \"The AP Latin: Virgil Exam is designed to test the student's ability to read, translate, understand, analyze, and interpret the lines of the Aeneid that appear on the course syllabus in Latin.\"Many phrases from this poem entered the Latin language, much as passages from Shakespeare and Alexander Pope have entered the English language. One example is from Aeneas' reaction to a painting of the sack of Troy: Sunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt\u2014\"These are the tears of things, and our mortality cuts to the heart\" (Aeneid I, 462).

{"id": "50_635", "question": "Who is the author of Hamlet?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_21305", "text": "The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, often shortened to Hamlet (), is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare sometime between 1599 and 1601. It is Shakespeare's longest play, with 29,551 words. Set in Denmark, the play depicts Prince Hamlet and his attempts to exact revenge against his uncle, Claudius, who has murdered Hamlet's father in order to seize his throne and marry Hamlet's mother. Hamlet is considered among the \"most powerful and influential tragedies in the English language\", with a story capable of \"seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others\". It is widely considered one of the greatest plays of all time. Three different early versions of the play are extant: the First Quarto (Q1, 1603); the Second Quarto (Q2, 1604); and the First Folio (F1, 1623). Each version includes lines and passages missing from the others.Many works have been pointed to as possible sources for Shakespeare's play, from ancient Greek tragedies to Elizabethan dramas. The editors of the Arden Shakespeare question the idea of \"source hunting\", pointing out that it presupposes that authors always require ideas from other works for their own, and suggests that no author can have an original idea or be an originator. When Shakespeare wrote, there were many stories about sons avenging the murder of their fathers, and many about clever avenging sons pretending to be foolish in order to outsmart their foes. This would include the story of the ancient Roman, Lucius Junius Brutus, which Shakespeare apparently knew, as well as the story of Amleth, which was preserved in Latin by 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum, and printed in Paris in 1514. The Amleth story was subsequently adapted and then published in French in 1570 by the 16th-century scholar Fran\u00e7ois de Belleforest. It has a number of plot elements and major characters in common with Shakespeare's Hamlet, and lacks others that are found in Shakespeare. Belleforest's story was first published in English in 1608, after Hamlet had been written, though it's possible that Shakespeare had encountered it in the French-language version.", "hasanswer": true}]}
{"id": "50_636", "question": "Who is the author of The Lord of the Rings?", "ctxs": [{"id": "50_21310", "text": "The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel by the English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. Set in Middle-earth, the story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 children's book The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling books ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.The title refers to the story's main antagonist, Sauron, the Dark Lord who in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power given to Men, Dwarves, and Elves, in his campaign to conquer all of Middle-earth. From homely beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land reminiscent of the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the quest to destroy the One Ring, seen mainly through the eyes of the hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin. Aiding Frodo are the Wizard Gandalf, the Men Aragorn and Boromir, the Elf Legolas, and the Dwarf Gimli, who unite in order to rally the Free Peoples of Middle-earth against Sauron's armies and give Frodo a chance to destroy the One Ring in the fire of Mount Doom.\nAlthough often mistakenly called a trilogy, the work was intended by Tolkien to be one volume in a two-volume set along with The Silmarillion. For economic reasons, The Lord of the Rings was first published over the course of a year from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955 in three volumes rather than one under the titles The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King; The Silmarillion appeared only after the author's death. The work is divided internally into six books, two per volume, with several appendices of background material. These three volumes were later published as a boxed set, and even finally as a single volume, following the author's original intent.\nTolkien's work, after an initially mixed reception by the literary establishment, has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes, literary devices, and origins. Influences on this earlier work, and on the story of The Lord of the Rings, include philology, mythology, Christianity, earlier fantasy works, and his own experiences in the First World War.\nThe Lord of the Rings is considered one of the greatest fantasy books ever written, and it has helped to create and shape the modern fantasy genre. Since release, it has been reprinted many times and translated into at least 38 languages. Its enduring popularity has led to numerous references in popular culture, the founding of many societies by fans of Tolkien's works, and the publication of many books about Tolkien and his works. It has inspired many derivative works, including paintings, music, films, television, video games, and board games. \nAward-winning adaptations of The Lord of the Rings have been made for radio, theatre, and film. It was named Britain's best-loved novel of all time in a 2003 poll by the BBC called The Big Read.", "hasanswer": true}]}

This identification is largely based on the following paragraph from a portion of Codex Upsaliensis, an early 14th-century manuscript containing the Edda:\n\nScholars have noted that this attribution, along with that of other primary manuscripts, is not clear whether or not Snorri is more than the compiler of the work and the author of H\u00e1ttatal or if he is the author of the entire Edda. Faulkes summarizes the matter of scholarly discourse around the authorship of the Prose Edda as follows:\n\nSnorri's authorship of the Prose Edda was upheld by the renaissance scholar Arngr\u00edmur J\u00f3nsson (1568\u20131648), and since his time it has generally been accepted without question. But the surviving manuscripts, which were all written more than half a century after Snorri's death, differ from each other considerably and it is not likely that any of them preserves the work quite as he wrote it. A number of passages in Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l especially have been thought to be interpolations, and this section of the work has clearly been subject to various kinds of revision in most manuscripts. It has also been argued that the prologue and the first paragraph and part of the last paragraph of Gylfaginning are not by Snorri, at least in their surviving forms.Whatever the case, the mention of Snorri in the manuscripts has been influential in a common acceptance of Snorri as the author or at least one of the authors of the Edda.", "hasanswer": false}]}

It is the first of three parts of a project he worked on for almost thirty years: his Kitab al-\u02bfIbar, a massive work of universal history filling seventeen volumes of 500 pages each in its modern edition. A draft of the Muqaddimah was completed in 1377. Manuscripts of the Muqaddimah copied in the lifetime of Ibn Khaldun are extant, and a number of them have autographed marginal notes or additions.In the Muqaddimah, Ibn Khaldun expounds on a \"new science\" around which he had maintained secrecy up until his retirement to Qal\u02bfat ibn Salama, a new science for the study of what he calls \"\u02bfumr\u0101n\" (\u0639\u064f\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0646). This new science, \u02bfilm al-\u02bfumr\u0101n (\u0639\u0650\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u064f\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0646), is based on Greco-Arab philosophy and seeks to study the evolution of humankind and society throughout history using a method that is essentially historical, empirical, rational, and demonstrative.The Muqaddimah shaped by Ibn Khaldun's characteristic moderation with regard to politics and religion\u2014was met without much enthusiasm or clear hostility in the first few centuries after it was written. It was alluded to in the works of two Moroccan writers, Mu\u1e25ammad Ibn al-Sakk\u0101k (d. 1413) and Ya\u02bfq\u016bb b. M\u016bs\u0101 al-Sayt\u0101n\u012b, but Mu\u1e25ammad b. \u02bfAl\u012b Ibn al-Azraq (d. 1496) is apparently the only contemporary writer of the Maghreb who clearly approved of his work, quoting from it abundantly in his Bad\u0101\u02bei\u02bf al-silk f\u012b \u1e6dab\u0101\u02bei\u02bf al-mulk (\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0628\u062f\u0627\u0626\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0643 \u0641\u064a \u0637\u0628\u0627\u0626\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u0643).It was cited more often in works from Egypt, celebrated by disciples including Al-Maqrizi (1364\u20131442) and Ibn \u02bfAmm\u0101r, and met with hostility by others such as Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani and his master Nur al-Din al-Haythami.In the following centuries, Khaldun appeared prominently, described as an authority on political history, in numerous biographical dictionaries\u2014especially in Ahmed Muhammad al-Maqqari's Naf\u1e25 al-\u1e6d\u012bb min ghu\u1e63n al-Andalus al-ra\u1e6d\u012bb\u200a\u2014but the Muqaddimah remained largely absent.Ottoman historians including K\u00e2tip \u00c7elebi (d. 1657) and Mustafa Naima (d. 1716) valued the social and political theories in the Muqaddimah, but did not apply them in the analysis of their own society. The first five out of six chapters were translated into Ottoman Turkish by Mehmed Pirizade (d. 1749), and the sixth chapter was translated by Ahmed Cevdet (d. 1895); the complete translation was published 1860/61.The Muqaddimah was first printed in 1857 at the Bulaq Press in Cairo in a standalone volume made by Na\u1e63r al-H\u016br\u012bn\u012b, with crucial support from Rifa'a at-Tahtawi, and as the first volume in a seven-volume set of Kitab al-\u02bfIbar a decade later.Abdesselam Cheddadi concludes that \"the strictly scientific contribution of Ibn Khald\u016bn to the field of history and the social sciences was not fully recognised in the Muslim world until the late nineteenth century.\"The Muqaddimah was first discovered in France through the partial Turkish translation of Mehmed Pirizade (d. 1749). In 1858, the year following the first publication in Cairo, \u00c9tienne-Marc Quatrem\u00e8re printed an edition of the Arabic text of the Muqaddimah in three volumes in Paris under the title Les Prol\u00e9gom\u00e8nes d\u2019Ebn Khaldoun.

{"id": "50_651", "question": "Who is the author of The Phantom?", "ctxs": [{"id": "86_50902", "text": "Andrew Lloyd Webber first began plans for a sequel to his 1986 hit musical, The Phantom of the Opera, in 1990. Following a conversation with Maria Bj\u00f6rnson, the designer of The Phantom of the Opera, Lloyd Webber decided that, were a sequel to come about, it would be set in New York City at the turn of the 20th century. One of his ideas was to have the Phantom live above ground in Manhattan's first penthouse, but he rejected this when he saw a TV documentary about the Coney Island fairground. Lloyd Webber began collaborating with author Frederick Forsyth on the project, but it soon fell apart as Lloyd Webber felt the ideas they were developing would be difficult to adapt for a stage musical. Forsyth went on to publish some of the ideas he had worked on with Lloyd Webber in 1999 as a novel entitled The Phantom of Manhattan.Lloyd Webber returned to the project in 2006, collaborating with a number of writers and directors. However, he still did not feel the ideas he had were adaptable into a piece of musical theatre. Finally, in early 2007, Lloyd Webber approached Ben Elton (who had served as the librettist for Lloyd Webber's The Beautiful Game) to help shape a synopsis for a sequel, based on Lloyd Webber's initial ideas. Elton's treatment of the story focused more on the original characters of The Phantom of the Opera and omitted new characters that Lloyd Webber and Forsyth had developed. Lloyd Webber was pleased with Elton's treatment and began work on the sequel. In March 2007, he announced he would be moving forward with the project. When Lloyd Webber approached the lyricist Glenn Slater to join the project, Slater's initial thought was that \"it just sounded like a terrible idea\".The sequel was delayed because Lloyd Webber's six-month-old kitten Otto, a rare-breed Turkish Van, climbed onto Lloyd Webber's Clavinova digital piano and managed to delete the entire score. Lloyd Webber was unable to recover any of it from the instrument, but was eventually able to reconstruct the score. In 2008, Lloyd Webber first announced that the sequel would likely be called Phantom: Once Upon Another Time, and the first act was performed at his annual Sydmonton Festival. The Phantom was played by Ramin Karimloo and Raoul was played by Alistair Robbins. However, in September 2008, during the BBC's Birthday in the Park concert celebrating his 60th birthday, Lloyd Webber announced that the title would be Love Never Dies. In other workshop readings, Raoul and Christine were played by Aaron Lazar and Elena Shaddow.On 3 July 2009, Lloyd Webber announced that Karimloo (who had played the Phantom in the West End) and Sierra Boggess (who had originated the role of Christine in Phantom \u2013 The Las Vegas Spectacular) had been cast as the Phantom and Christine and that the role of Meg Giry would be played by Summer Strallen, Madame Giry by Liz Robertson, and Raoul by Joseph Millson.  I'd Do Anything finalist Niamh Perry was given the role of Fleck.\nLloyd Webber originally intended for Love Never Dies to open simultaneously in London, New York, and Shanghai in the autumn of 2009. By March 2009, he had decided to open the show at London's Adelphi Theatre, followed by Toronto's Royal Alexandra Theatre (before transferring to Broadway's Neil Simon Theatre in 2010) and Shanghai. The three casts would rehearse simultaneously in London for three months beginning August 2009. Opening dates were soon announced as 26 October 2009 in London, November in Toronto and February 2010 in Shanghai, with a later transfer to Melbourne, Australia. Plans were then announced for a separate Broadway production to run concurrently with the Toronto show if Toronto proved successful. In May, the debut of the London production was delayed until March 2010 due to Lloyd Webber re-orchestrating the score and re-recording the album. Technical issues with special effects and an automaton version of Christine, and the casting of multiple simultaneous productions also contributed to the postponement. By October 2009, Shanghai plans had been dropped in favour of an Australian production.On 8 October 2009, Lloyd Webber held a press conference at Her Majesty's Theatre, where the original Phantom has been running since 1986, confirming the casting of Boggess as Christine and Karimloo as the Phantom. Karimloo sang \"Til I Hear You Sing\" and the instrumental \"The Coney Island Waltz\" was performed by an orchestra for the journalists, industry insiders, and fans who had assembled for the presentation. Lloyd Webber announced that Love Never Dies would begin previews in London on 20 February 2010 and anticipated that the Broadway production would open on 11 November 2010 (this was later postponed and then indefinitely and to date has never come to fruition). Rehearsals began in January 2010.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The largest single work to have survived from the Roman Empire to the modern day, the Natural History compiles information gleaned from other ancient authors. Despite the work's title, its subject area is not limited to what is today understood by natural history; Pliny himself defines his scope as \"the natural world, or life\". It is encyclopedic in scope, but its structure is not like that of a modern encyclopedia. It is the only work by Pliny to have survived, and the last that he published. He published the first 10 books in AD 77, but had not made a final revision of the remainder at the time of his death during the AD 79 eruption of Vesuvius. The rest was published posthumously by Pliny's nephew, Pliny the Younger.\nThe work is divided into 37 books, organised into 10 volumes. These cover topics including astronomy, mathematics, geography, ethnography, anthropology, human physiology, zoology, botany, agriculture, horticulture, pharmacology, mining, mineralogy, sculpture, art, and precious stones.\nPliny's Natural History became a model for later encyclopedias and scholarly works as a result of its breadth of subject matter, its referencing of original authors, and its index.", "hasanswer": true}]}
