Historically, many Slavic nations and states adopted flags and other national symbols that used some combination of those three colors. Slavic countries that use or have used the colors include Russia, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia, whereas Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland and Ukraine use different color schemes.\nYugoslavia, both the Kingdom (Kingdom of Yugoslavia, 1918\u20131943) and the Republic (SFR Yugoslavia, 1943\u20131992) was a union of several Slavic nations, and therefore not only sported the pan-Slavic colors but adopted the pan-Slavic flag as its own (later adding a red star). After the initial breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, two of the remaining Yugoslav republics\u2014Montenegro and Serbia\u2014reconstituted as Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1992 and as State Union of Serbia and Montenegro in 2003, and continued to use the pan-Slavic flag until its own dissolution when Montenegro proclaimed independence in 2006. Serbia continues to use a flag with all three Pan-Slavic colors, along with fellow republics Croatia and Slovenia.\nMost flags with pan-Slavic colors have been introduced and recognized by Slavic nations following the first Slavic Congress of 1848, although Serbia adopted its red-blue-white tricolor in 1835 and the ethnic flag of Sorbs (blue-red-white) had already been designed in 1842. Czech Moravians proclaimed their flag (white-red-blue) at the very congress. In 1848, Croatian viceroy Josip Jela\u010di\u0107 first designed the flag of Croatia with its modern tricolor (red-white-blue) for the then-concepted Triune Kingdom (and officially adopted by the Kingdom of Croatia), a group of Slovenian intellectuals in Vienna, Austria created the flag of Slovenia (white-blue-red), and the first Slovak flag (in reverse layout \u2013 red-blue-white) was introduced and flown by Slovak revolutionaries.

Horses were known to be present on the Iberian Peninsula as far back as 20,000 BC, and by 800 BC the region was renowned for its war horses. The fame of the horses from Lusitania goes back to the Roman Age, which attributed its speed to the influence of the West wind, who was considered capable of fertilizing the mares. When the Muslims invaded Iberia in 711 AD, they brought Arabian horses with them that were crossed with the native horses, developing a horse that became useful for war, dressage and bull fighting. The Portuguese horse was named the Lusitano, after the word Lusitania, the ancient Roman name for the region that modern Portugal occupies. There are four main breed lineages within the breed today, and characteristics differ slightly between each line.\nLusitanos can be any solid color, although they are generally gray, bay or chestnut. Horses of the Alter Real strain are always brown. Members of the breed are of Baroque type, with convex facial profiles, heavy muscling, intelligent and willing natures, with agile and elevated movement. Originally bred for war, dressage and bullfighting, Lusitanos are still used today in the latter two. They have competed in several Olympics and World Equestrian Games as part of the Portuguese and Spanish dressage teams. They have also made a showing in driving competitions, with a Belgian team of Lusitanos winning multiple international titles.", "hasanswer": true}]}

The modern breed's precise line of descent is unclear, but numerous outside influences have been recorded throughout the history of Finland. Linguistic analysis suggest that horse was in use in Finland in the bronze age, but the earliest archaeological evidence of horses existing in what today is Finland dates to the Finnish Middle Iron Age (400\u2013800 CE). The Finnhorse and its progenitors later became an indispensable asset for military forces from the region of Finland during the times of Swedish and Russian rule, and since independence as well. In addition to functionality as military and working horses, the Finnhorse has also been bred for speed in harness racing, and it can be argued that this sport was the main factor in the survival of the breed after its numbers crashed during the later half of the 20th century, from approximately 400,000 animals in the 1950s to 14,000 in the 1980s.

It can also have almond-shaped or \"hooded\" eyes.  The mane and tail are usually sparse. The long back is lightly muscled, and is coupled to a flat croup and long, upright neck. The Akhal-Teke possess sloping shoulders and thin skin.\nThe breed is tough and resilient, having adapted to the harshness of Turkmenistan lands, where horses must live without much food or water. This has also made the horses good for sport. The breed is known for its endurance, as shown in 1935 when a group of Turkmen riders rode the 4,000 kilometres (2,500 mi) from Ashgabat to Moscow in 84 days, including a three-day crossing of 378 km (235 mi) of desert without water. The Akhal-Teke is also known for its form and grace as a show jumper.\nThe quality of the Akhal-Teke horses are determined by the studbook manager. Depending on type, conformation, pedigree, quality of offspring and achievement in sport, the horses are designated as either Elite or Class I or Class II. There are usually 2 annual grading events in Moscow, Russia called the \"International Sport Meeting and World Championship \u201cHeavenly Argamak\u201d and \"Golden Akhal-Teke Cup Shael\" where breeders present their best horses to a group of judges.

{"id": "462_9", "question": "What color is Figment?", "ctxs": [{"id": "462_63071", "text": "Figment was created by Tony Baxter, who came up with the name \"Figment\" after watching an episode of Magnum, P.I., in which a goat has eaten Higgins' (John Hillerman) flowers and Higgins says, \"Don't tell me [the goat is] a figment of my imagination. Figments don't eat rare tropical flowers\".The Journey Into Imagination pavilion opened with the rest of EPCOT Center on October 1, 1982, but the Journey Into Imagination dark ride did not open until March 5, 1983. In the original attraction, Dreamfinder, a jolly wizard-like scientist, teaches Figment how to use his imagination. Figment\u2019s original character design was created by Grayson Shafer in 1976. Maddie Shafer inspired him in his designs. Figment is meant to be the literal embodiment of the phrase \"figment of the imagination\". He is composed of various elements Dreamfinder found in his travels including two tiny wings, large yellow eyes, the horns of a steer (or dilemma, according to a 1983 appearance on the Today Show), a crocodile's snout, and the childish delight found at a birthday party. Figment is described in detail in the Dreamfinder's song \"One Little Spark\" (by the Sherman Brothers). Dreamfinder introduces him: \"Two tiny wings, eyes big and yellow, horns of a steer, but a lovable fellow. From head to tail, he's royal purple pigment, and there, voila, you've got a Figment\".\nThough taking on many disguises within the attractions, including being a superhero, a cowboy, a knight, a skunk, a dancer, a mountain climber, and a pirate, Figment seems to have some special aspirations to be an astronaut, from being seen in a spacesuit in the original and current attractions to dialogue in the original stating \"I wish I could be an astronaut. I bet I can use imagination to discover all kinds of new things!\" Because of this, Figment is frequently portrayed in merchandising in a spacesuit, in addition to some of his other roles.\nIn 1999, Disney radically refurbished the Journey Into Imagination attraction as part of its Millennium Celebration at Epcot, removing Dreamfinder and Figment except for fleeting glimpses of the dragon. That version, titled Journey Into Your Imagination, was a completely new experience in which Dr. Nigel Channing (Eric Idle of Monty Python fame) led a tour of the fictional Imagination Institute. The Channing character originated in the adjacent Honey, I Shrunk the Audience 3-D movie attraction.\nIn the current version, Figment's creativity has a bit of a larger effect on the world around him, be it transforming a large smell emitting machine into a slot machine, turning his house upside down, actually rearranging an otherwise static eye chart, and transforming the Institute into something almost reminiscent of the original in the finale. He can also pull a pair of glasses out of thin air to put onto Dr. Channing in the introduction and quickly change into a skunk costume in the Smell Lab.\nAfter numerous complaints about the revamped attraction, including a Disney stockholder who questioned CEO Michael Eisner about Figment's absence during the company's annual shareholders meeting, a modest 2002 refurbishment modified the 1999 version to add the dragon as a playful foil for Dr. Channing throughout the Imagination Institute tour. The new version pointedly was branded Journey Into Imagination with Figment.\nIn the original attraction, Figment was voiced by Billy Barty; in the version in-between, Corey Burton portrayed Figment, and in the current version, Muppeteer Dave Goelz provides the voice, because Barty had died before the second version had shut down.\nOutside the attractions at Epcot, Figment appeared in several Disney-produced educational short films in the late '80s, two of which featured Peter Pan and Alice from Alice in Wonderland (each played by a live-action actor), and has a brief cameo as a painting in the Pixar films Inside Out and Toy Story 4. Additionally, Disney and Marvel published Disney Kingdoms: Figment, a five issue miniseries focused on the origins of Figment and Dreamfinder, starting in June 2014, which was followed up with a sequel Disney Kingdoms: Figment 2 in October 2015. In 2017 Figment also made an appearance in the Guardians of the Galaxy Mission: Breakout! dark ride attraction in Disney California Adventure as a collector's item in the Collector's archive.\nA film centered around the character is currently in development at Disney, with Seth Rogen producing under his Point Grey Pictures banner, Dan Hernandez and Benji Samit writing the screenplay.Figment was announced as an unlockable racer in the Disney Speedstorm arcade racing game and was introduced when the game launched in early access on April 18, 2023.

The incident was witnessed by P\u0103tra\u015fcu during the early 1960s, and took place in his native town of Caransebe\u015f, shortly before a celebration of August 23 (Communist Romania's national holiday, commemorating the 1944 coup). The militiamen involved had detained two youths with no prior criminal record, accusing them of having been drunk and disorderly, and had decided to make them reenact the scene in order to educate the public about the perils of alcohol. In a 1999 interview, P\u0103tra\u0219cu acknowledges that, as a university student and part-time activist at a local culture house, he was a member of the original crew.Like in the film, the militiamen's decision seems to have outweighed the punishment proscribed for such offences: they made the youths film the same scene over and over, and, in the process, exposed them to public humiliation. P\u0103tra\u0219cu, who credits German writer Erich Maria Remarque and his All Quiet on the Western Front with having inspired his narrative, states: \"At the actual, filmed reenactment I for one had a terrible shock. They were children, they were just children. The police made them do what they had previously done. But that was a beach, a pool, there were girlies wearing bathing suits, some of them were connected with those girlies, and the [militiamen] were making them do what they had done when they were drunk, which was absurd, which made me shiver.\" In both story and film, Vuic\u0103 dies after his friend, pressured by the authorities into making the reenactment look more authentic, hits him over the head with a stone.There was a significant gap between the story's publishing and the start of production. Filmmaker Mircea S\u0103ucan recalls repeatedly urging P\u0103tra\u015fcu to turn his text into a screenplay. Before Pintilie took up the project, Horia P\u0103tra\u0219cu says, he was approached by two other directors. The first was Radu Gabrea, who abandoned it once he decided to resettle in West Germany; the second was Liviu Ciulei, who disagreed with the writer over the plot's tragic outcome, and eventually ended talks. Also according to P\u0103tra\u015fcu, Pintilie was enthusiastic about making the film, and anxiously approached the author just as he was taking his final exams. George Mih\u0103i\u0163\u0103, Vladimir G\u0103itan and Ileana Popovici were debuting actors in their early twenties. As Mih\u0103i\u0163\u0103 recalls, he and G\u0103itan were cast after a brief interview with Pintilie. Poet and actor Emil Botta was fifty-seven at the time, while George Constantin was thirty-five and Ernest Maftei forty-eight. Despite the marked age difference, Mih\u0103i\u021b\u0103 remembers, the communication on the set was smooth and the atmosphere playful.The film was shot on location in the Southern Carpathian resort of Sinaia, but preserves some elements from the intended setting, including the restaurant's name of Pesc\u0103ru\u0219 (\"Seagull\"), which had been borrowed from its Caransebe\u0219 model.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Outside Tomas' house, FBI agent Carmen Rivera (Lisa Vidal), is waiting. She followed Cici to Los Angeles as part of an investigation. Fala, Cici's business partner, had Cici do her boyfriend, Ricky, a favor by taking a car that he sold online to the buyer in Los Angeles. Ricky is involved in the Whittaker counterfeit ring that Agent Rivera is investigating.

They load all their bags in Ricky's car and, after a short chase, they decide to stay at a Marriott hotel instead of a Motel 6. Unfortunately, Patricia's credit cards have been canceled by her mother. However, Lorena is their saving grace. The Miss Latina American Beauty Pageant is being held in that very same hotel and Miss Puerto Rico's flight was delayed. Lorena bears a resemblance to the real beauty contestant and takes her place. Cici passes herself and Patricia off as her staff. When moving their bags to Miss Puerto Rico's room, a bag falls off the cart onto the luggage room floor. In the hotel room, all three girls have dinner, empty three bottles of champagne and share their life stories with each other. They each then have a dream in which they end up with Tom\u00e1s but feel bad about leaving the other two behind.\nThe next morning, Lorena has to meet the judges and Cici has to deliver Ricky's car to a man named Rodrigo (D.L.

Since she looks \"so much better without all that money\", she simply takes the other one out. Victor and Rodrigo spot them and the girls run on stage where Sheila E. is performing and dance to singer Christina Vidal's song, Dejar\u00e9, regardless of their mixed dance backgrounds. Victor and Rodrigo get closer to the stage, causing the girls to run off mid-performance. They all run to the puppet, where Carmen and other FBI agents surround them and apprehend Victor and Rodrigo. Tom\u00e1s is reunited with all three of his girlfriends. He apologizes to them for his deception and is unable to choose between them.

Nemo, a nine-year-old boy, has been thrust into a position where he must make an impossible decision\u2014to choose between his mother and father. In the seconds preceding the rest of his life, he wonders where each choice will take him. The forces of the universe working to bring about total chaos are counteracted by this boy's overactive imagination. The dilemma that causes the film's main problem (not knowing the future), once solved, makes it all the more difficult: \"I don't know the future, therefore I cannot make a decision. Now that I know the future I still cannot make one.\" The eloquent interplay between philosophical lifestyle and what forges reality is epitomized by the way the film constantly jumps between scenes of the young boy, the adolescent, and the mature man. The film takes a four-dimensionalist view of the nature and existence of life in the universe, with each decision branching off to create an entirely separate alternate universe. Mr. Nobody raises many ontological arguments about the subjective nature of time and investigates how actions have universal consequences, and how every single choice, irrespective of its simplicity or complexity, can make, alter, or change a lifetime.The film also makes substantial use of chaos theory, string theory, and the butterfly effect to accentuate the lack of control that humans, as individuals, possess.

The film portrays a life where we are all subject to chance, the dimensions by which we construct our reality (height, length, width, and time), and the imagination of our former selves, and, once the boy Nemo knows the outcome of a given choice, he instinctively opts for another.The different colors used in the film have symbolic meanings. Each of the three main storylines has its own unique hue that highlights its originality and unlikeness to the others. The color differentiation can be traced as far back as Nemo's childhood, where his possible future wives, Jean, Elise, and Anna, sit on a bench, wearing yellow, blue, and red dresses, respectively. In his life with Jean, Nemo seeks material well-being and independence, and yellow\u2014the color of life and wealth\u2014emphasizes this.

Finally, the true love and passionate relationship between Nemo and Anna is symbolized by the red color of Anna's dress.

This is a parody of similar theistic claims about God: that God, as creator of the universe, is not subject to its laws and thus not physically detecting him tells us nothing about his existence or lack thereof. The Invisible Pink Unicorn is an illustration which attempts to demonstrate the absurdity of citing attributes and a lack of evidence as proof of a deity's existence. Her two defining attributes, invisibility and color (pink), are inconsistent and contradictory; this is part of the satire. The paradox of something being invisible yet having visible characteristics (color) is reflected in some East Asian cultures, wherein an invisible red string is said to connect people who have a shared or linked destiny.\nThere are humorous mock debates amongst her \"followers\" concerning her other attributes, such as whether she is completely invisible or invisible to most, but visible only to those who have faith in her (bearing similarities to \"The Emperor's New Clothes\"). Some arguments are quite elaborate and tortuous, satirizing the disputatiousness and intricacy of the theological debates that occur in many religions.The Invisible Pink Unicorn is also used to de-deify religious texts. The goal is to have the reader experience the text without heavily loaded concepts that many readers will associate with omnipotence, or will read with an unquestioned faith. It is argued that when someone re-reads the same text with all direct references to God replaced with the Invisible Pink Unicorn, the reader may see the text in a new and more critical way: \n\nIn the beginning the Invisible Pink Unicorn created the heavens and the earth...and the Spirit of the Invisible Pink Unicorn was hovering over the waters.

Widows do not wear sindoor or bindis, signifying that their husband is no longer alive.\nThe sindoor is first applied to the woman by her husband on the day of her wedding; this is called the Sindoor Danam ceremony. After this, she applies it herself every day.\nA similar colouring ritual is known as pasupu kumkuma, named after another name for sindoor, kumkuma.\n\nThe wiping off of the sindoor is very significant for a widow. There are many rituals associated with this practice. The most common is when a mother-in-law or older sister-in-law wipes off the sindoor when a woman becomes a widow. The widow will break her bangles and remove her bindi as well, and many will also remove their nose ring and toe rings. The parting of hair is symbolic of a river of red blood full of life. When the sindoor is removed then the river becomes barren, dry and empty. This custom is prevalent in rural areas and is followed by all castes and social ranks.The red sindoor is significant for the married woman as she is full of colour.

In the seconds preceding the rest of his life, he wonders where each choice will take him. The forces of the universe working to bring about total chaos are counteracted by this boy's overactive imagination. The dilemma that causes the film's main problem (not knowing the future), once solved, makes it all the more difficult: \"I don't know the future, therefore I cannot make a decision. Now that I know the future I still cannot make one.\" The eloquent interplay between philosophical lifestyle and what forges reality is epitomized by the way the film constantly jumps between scenes of the young boy, the adolescent, and the mature man. The film takes a four-dimensionalist view of the nature and existence of life in the universe, with each decision branching off to create an entirely separate alternate universe. Mr. Nobody raises many ontological arguments about the subjective nature of time and investigates how actions have universal consequences, and how every single choice, irrespective of its simplicity or complexity, can make, alter, or change a lifetime.The film also makes substantial use of chaos theory, string theory, and the butterfly effect to accentuate the lack of control that humans, as individuals, possess.

The Heck horse was created by the German zoologist brothers Heinz Heck and Lutz Heck, director of the Berlin Zoo, at the Tierpark Hellabrunn (Munich Zoo) in Germany in their attempt to breed back the tarpan. The Hecks believed they could recreate the extinct tarpan subspecies by back breeding living descendants. They believed they could combine and rearrange the genetic material from these living descendants into a recreation of the extinct horse. Other breeders had the same idea, and used different genetic stock to attempt to recreate the tarpan or a reasonable look-alike. One result was a line of horses bred from American Mustangs by breeder Harry Hegardt.The Heck brothers bred together several European small horse and pony breeds hypothesized to be descended from the tarpan. They eventually integrated mares of the Konik, Icelandic horse, and Gotland breeds. These mares were bred to stallions of a wild horse type known as Przewalski's horse. The Hecks believed the wild Przewalski blood would help to draw out the wild characteristics they felt lay dormant in the domesticated pony breed mares. The initial crosses were made between Gotland and Icelandic mares (who visually closely resembled the tarpan, especially in the shape of the head) and Przewalski's horse stallions (who provided the desired dun coloration and upright mane), and the offspring were then bred to each other. The first foal born from the program who had the desired coloration was a colt born on May 22, 1933, at the Tierpark Hellabrunn. The breeding program continued, using only those horses showing the desired skull shape, bone structure and coloration. Relatively quickly, the breed's conformation and coloration became set, with parents reliably passing their characteristics to their offspring.During World War II, horses of the desired type were taken from German-occupied countries to use in the Hecks' breeding program. Tadeusz Vetulani, a Polish biologist, had been working with Konik horses, at that point believed to be descended from tarpans, with the goal (like the Hecks) of recreating the tarpan. Some of the horses from his program had been reintroduced to the forests of Bia\u0142owie\u017ca, Poland. During the war, the Hecks removed the animals from the forest and used them in their own breeding programs. Vetulani considered this a \"baffling campaign of destruction\", and the Hecks' actions effectively ended his breeding program. Some of the resulting Heck horses were sent back to Bia\u0142owie\u017ca, to become part of a hunting preserve for Nazi government officials. The land, and the horses, were returned to Polish management after the war ended. As of 2007, a small herd of the horses remained, living with little interference from humans, in Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest, Europe's last remaining area of primeval lowland forest. The Hecks had conducted a similar breeding program in hopes of recreating the aurochs, resulting in what would become Heck cattle.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She expresses her fear and distress toward ongoing racial mixing and uses biblical citations as divine justification for white supremacy.\nThe slave-holder, in many instances, was as much to be pitied as the slaves, but the Northerners could not see this. He (the slave-holder), too, was a victim of the system, often having inherited slaves along with his plantation. Where the slaves were well treated they were happy and contented, and their owners found consolation in this, using it as an argument in support of the institution. But some radicals could never see this side of the question. They dwelt continually on the cruelties of a few hard taskmasters and ignored the good people who had the welfare of their dependents at heart. It was hard for the Southerners to be reconciled to this spirit so widely manifested in the North. No matter what the better class of slave-owners might do, they had to bear the stigma and cruelty with the worst of tyrants. ...\nA strong attachment as a rule existed between the negro servants and their masters which could not be easily broken. When it came time to taking away a colored \"Mammy\" who had brought up the children of her white master, even nursing them at her own breast in an extremity, here was more involved than a Northerner could readily comprehend. This aspect of slavery was never taken into serious consideration by hot-headed Abolitionists who tried to foment war and bring about disunion. ...\nWhite supremacy is an issue of great importance. If some of the colored people are not curbed in their ambition to mix their blood with that of the white race, it will not be long until there will be no such thing as definite racial lines. The Negroes are going north and settling indiscriminately among the whites. Property values are being depreciated by this influx of colored immigration. But little sympathy was shown the South when a race of colored slaves was liberated among them. The North had no conception of what it meant for the white people of the South to preserve the color and racial lines, considering the fact that in some places the population was about equally divided, and there was no cooperation from the North to be had in the struggle. ...\n\nThe Book of Genesis, in its account of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, sons of Noah, teaches the supremacy of the white race.

Noah awoke from his wine and said, \"Cursed be Canaan [Ham]; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.\" \"Blessed be the Lord of God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.\" \"God shall enlarge Japheth [the white race], and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant\" (Gen. 9:25-27). This edict was imposed by a wise and just God, and should not work a hardship on the black race. It cannot be otherwise than it should be for their good.

In the morning, she becomes her ordinary self by washing off the glitter and the grime from the night before. She asks her lovers to leave.

She describes her stuff as the way she sits with her legs open sometimes, her chewed up fingernails, her rhythm, her voice, her talk, her \"delicate leg and whimsical kiss\".  The person who stole her stuff is a man. She made too much room for this man who has run off with her stuff, especially because he does not even know that he has it.

Some examples include: he is sorry because he does not know how she got your number, sorry because he was high, sorry because he is only human, and sorry because he thought she could handle it. The lady in blue then declares that she does not need any more apologies. She goes on to say that men should keep their apologies for themselves, because she does not need them to soothe her soul and she cannot use them.

And she will not apologize for any of it.\n\n\"positive\" \u2013 Ladies in Red, Yellow, Purple, BrownLady in yellow, purple, brown, red participate in reciting the next poem about contracting HIV/AIDS; they share the lines and all speak to one woman's experience.

The hands are strong, cool, moving, and make them whole and pure. The lady in blue says she feels the gods coming into her, laying her open to herself. She goes on to say that she knows about laying her body open for a man, but still she was missing something. Finally, all the ladies repeat the lines she says, \"i found god in myself / & i loved her / I loved her fiercely\".

Two strangers, model ship collector Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine and antique-scout Barnaby, independently try and fail to persuade Tintin to sell the model to them. Tintin also meets detectives Thomson and Thompson on a secret mission looking out for a pickpocket; however, both their wallets are repeatedly stolen throughout the story. At Tintin's flat, Snowy accidentally knocks the model over and breaks its mainmast. Having shown the ship to Haddock, Tintin discovers that the ship is named the Unicorn, after a ship commanded by Haddock's own ancestor. \nWhile Tintin is out, the ship is stolen from his apartment; in the following investigation, he discovers that Sakharine owns an identical model, also named the Unicorn. At home, Tintin discovers a miniature scroll, and realises that it must have been hidden inside the mast of the model. Written on the parchment is a riddle: \"Three brothers joined. Three Unicorns in company sailing in the noonday sunne will speak. For 'tis from the light that light will dawn, and then shines forth the Eagle's cross\". Captain Haddock vividly recounts the tale of the Unicorn, a 17th-century warship captained by his ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock, but seized by a pirate band led by Red Rackham. In a retold flashback, it is shown how Francis' ship is attacked by Red Rackham and his crew. At first the pirates raise the black Jolly Roger, indicating that quarter (safe conduct) is offered in exchange for peaceful surrender, but when Francis refuses to strike his flag and bombards the pirates with cannon fire, the pirates instead \"hoists fresh colors\" and raise the \"red pennant\" (a bloody flag, French: pavillon sans quartier), signaling no quarter (no mercy, no prisoners), after which they board Francis' ship and massacre his crew. The only one of his crew to survive the boarding, Sir Francis killed Red Rackham in single combat and scuttled the Unicorn; he later built three models, which he left to his sons.\nTintin deduces that each of the models contains a scroll, which united lead to the location of Red Rackham's treasure. Tintin and Haddock try to get the three scrolls but they are out of luck: Tintin's wallet (with the first scroll) is stolen, while Sakharine is found drugged, and the scroll inside his own Unicorn missing. Meanwhile, Barnaby requests a meeting with Tintin, but is gunned down on Tintin's doorstep before he can speak, and points to sparrows as a cryptic clue to the identity of his assailant before falling unconscious. A few days later, Tintin is kidnapped by the perpetrators of the shooting: the Bird brothers, two unscrupulous antique dealers who own the third model of the Unicorn. They are behind the theft of Tintin's model and have also stolen Sakharine's parchment, knowing that only by possessing all three parchments can the location of Red Rackham's treasure be found. \nTintin escapes from the cellars of the Bird brothers' country estate, Marlinspike Hall, while the Captain arrives with Thomson and Thompson to arrest them. It is revealed that the Bird Brothers have only one of the parchments, as two were lost when their wallet was stolen. It is also revealed that Barnaby survived and has made a full recovery, much to Max Bird's enragement. The Bird brothers are arrested. Tintin and Thomson and Thompson track down the pickpocket, Aristides Silk, a kleptomaniac who has a penchant for collecting wallets, and obtain the Bird Brothers' wallet, containing the missing two parchments.

{"id": "462_50", "question": "What is the color of Three Ages?", "ctxs": [{"id": "57_33803", "text": "Mr. Nobody can be seen as a tale about choice. Nemo, a nine-year-old boy, has been thrust into a position where he must make an impossible decision\u2014to choose between his mother and father. In the seconds preceding the rest of his life, he wonders where each choice will take him. The forces of the universe working to bring about total chaos are counteracted by this boy's overactive imagination. The dilemma that causes the film's main problem (not knowing the future), once solved, makes it all the more difficult: \"I don't know the future, therefore I cannot make a decision. Now that I know the future I still cannot make one.\" The eloquent interplay between philosophical lifestyle and what forges reality is epitomized by the way the film constantly jumps between scenes of the young boy, the adolescent, and the mature man. The film takes a four-dimensionalist view of the nature and existence of life in the universe, with each decision branching off to create an entirely separate alternate universe. Mr. Nobody raises many ontological arguments about the subjective nature of time and investigates how actions have universal consequences, and how every single choice, irrespective of its simplicity or complexity, can make, alter, or change a lifetime.The film also makes substantial use of chaos theory, string theory, and the butterfly effect to accentuate the lack of control that humans, as individuals, possess. There are numerous scenes, at each stage of his life, where Nemo is subject to the whims of chance, often plunging into water, a place where humans lack control, as a visual symbol of the powerlessness attributed to the human condition. The theories are used to compound reality in the film, a reality in which time always moves in one direction\u2014the smoke never goes back into the cigarette. Then, at the end, when it seems the universe is on the precipice of ultimate chaos, making use of the Big Crunch theory, time halts and begins to reverse. This brings the freedom from choice Nemo had been seeking, for, as Nemo says in the film, \"as long as you don't choose, everything remains possible.\" The tale of Nemo Nobody reflects a life of choices, whether or not we made the correct choices, and what would happen if we could go back and change them. In the end, Mr. Nobody, at age 118, states that it doesn't matter what we choose, because each choice, once made, has just as much significance as any alternate choice would have. The film portrays a life where we are all subject to chance, the dimensions by which we construct our reality (height, length, width, and time), and the imagination of our former selves, and, once the boy Nemo knows the outcome of a given choice, he instinctively opts for another.The different colors used in the film have symbolic meanings. Each of the three main storylines has its own unique hue that highlights its originality and unlikeness to the others. The color differentiation can be traced as far back as Nemo's childhood, where his possible future wives, Jean, Elise, and Anna, sit on a bench, wearing yellow, blue, and red dresses, respectively. In his life with Jean, Nemo seeks material well-being and independence, and yellow\u2014the color of life and wealth\u2014emphasizes this. Choosing Elise, Nemo experiences the consequences of depression and despair, which are themes associated with the color blue. Finally, the true love and passionate relationship between Nemo and Anna is symbolized by the red color of Anna's dress. It is also noteworthy that the unborn Nemo is shown living in a white world, as white contains all colors of the visible spectrum, which supports the allegorical message of the film that all things are possible until a choice is made. At the end of his life, Nemo is a decrepit old man and lives in a white surrounding (room, clothes, doctor), indicating that the fate of the protagonist leads him back to his origins\u2014the point at which everything is possible.The idea of a child learning about their whole life in the womb only to have an angel take the memory away is a reference to the Jewish concept of Lailah, the Angel of Conception, and it also bears a resemblance to the Myth of Er as found in the Republic.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She expresses her fear and distress toward ongoing racial mixing and uses biblical citations as divine justification for white supremacy.\nThe slave-holder, in many instances, was as much to be pitied as the slaves, but the Northerners could not see this. He (the slave-holder), too, was a victim of the system, often having inherited slaves along with his plantation. Where the slaves were well treated they were happy and contented, and their owners found consolation in this, using it as an argument in support of the institution. But some radicals could never see this side of the question. They dwelt continually on the cruelties of a few hard taskmasters and ignored the good people who had the welfare of their dependents at heart. It was hard for the Southerners to be reconciled to this spirit so widely manifested in the North. No matter what the better class of slave-owners might do, they had to bear the stigma and cruelty with the worst of tyrants. ...\nA strong attachment as a rule existed between the negro servants and their masters which could not be easily broken. When it came time to taking away a colored \"Mammy\" who had brought up the children of her white master, even nursing them at her own breast in an extremity, here was more involved than a Northerner could readily comprehend. This aspect of slavery was never taken into serious consideration by hot-headed Abolitionists who tried to foment war and bring about disunion. ...\nWhite supremacy is an issue of great importance. If some of the colored people are not curbed in their ambition to mix their blood with that of the white race, it will not be long until there will be no such thing as definite racial lines. The Negroes are going north and settling indiscriminately among the whites. Property values are being depreciated by this influx of colored immigration. But little sympathy was shown the South when a race of colored slaves was liberated among them. The North had no conception of what it meant for the white people of the South to preserve the color and racial lines, considering the fact that in some places the population was about equally divided, and there was no cooperation from the North to be had in the struggle. ...\n\nThe Book of Genesis, in its account of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, sons of Noah, teaches the supremacy of the white race.  Ham saw the nakedness of his father, but made no effort to cover him, and a curse was pronounced upon him and his posterity. Noah awoke from his wine and said, \"Cursed be Canaan [Ham]; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.\" \"Blessed be the Lord of God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.\" \"God shall enlarge Japheth [the white race], and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant\" (Gen. 9:25-27). This edict was imposed by a wise and just God, and should not work a hardship on the black race. It cannot be otherwise than it should be for their good. Until the curse is lifted from the human race, the very best position that the sons of Ham could be placed in is that of servants (not slaves), thus establishing white supremacy as foretold more than four thousand years ago. ...", "hasanswer": false}]}

Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. Bronze usually refers to copper-tin alloys, but can refer to any alloy of copper such as aluminium bronze. Copper is one of the most important constituents of silver and karat gold solders used in the jewelry industry, modifying the color, hardness and melting point of the resulting alloys. Some lead-free solders consist of tin alloyed with a small proportion of copper and other metals.The alloy of copper and nickel, called cupronickel, is used in low-denomination coins, often for the outer cladding. The US five-cent coin (currently called a nickel) consists of 75% copper and 25% nickel in homogeneous composition. Prior to the introduction of cupronickel, which was widely adopted by countries in the latter half of the 20th century, alloys of copper and silver were also used, with the United States using an alloy of 90% silver and 10% copper until 1965, when circulating silver was removed from all coins with the exception of the half dollar\u2014these were debased to an alloy of 40% silver and 60% copper between 1965 and 1970.

Historically, many Slavic nations and states adopted flags and other national symbols that used some combination of those three colors. Slavic countries that use or have used the colors include Russia, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia, whereas Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland and Ukraine use different color schemes.\nYugoslavia, both the Kingdom (Kingdom of Yugoslavia, 1918\u20131943) and the Republic (SFR Yugoslavia, 1943\u20131992) was a union of several Slavic nations, and therefore not only sported the pan-Slavic colors but adopted the pan-Slavic flag as its own (later adding a red star).

In the same year made his first characters Blu and Franklin, and decided that Blu would be the protagonist. Both were based on his own childhood, Franklin based on Maur\u00edcio himself and Blu on his pet dog Cu\u00edca. The main inspirations of Monica and Friends were through American comics like Peanuts and Little Lulu, which have inspired some recurring themes like the boys' club. In the following year of 1960, the characters gained ground through the children's magazine Zaz Traz by publisher Editora Outubro, later getting their own comic titled Bidu by Editora Continental. However, the magazines were canceled that same year.After that the characters returned to newspaper strips, the character Jimmy Five which had won great popularity in the previous magazines has become protagonist of their own strips of newspaper next to Blu and Franklin in 1961. Seeing potential in the character, Mauricio went on to create several supporting characters to appear in the Jimmy Five strips, like Smudge and Specs. But after so long Maur\u00edcio received a complaint for the lack of feminine characters in his comics. So to avoid further controversy, in 1963 Monica was created, initially as a supporting character in the Jimmy Five strips (at first as the Specs' little sister) based on Mauricio's real daughter M\u00f4nica Sousa. Over time, the success and the charisma of the character made her be the protagonist of the series alongside Jimmy Five which became her sidekick. Also in 1963, Mauricio began to create new projects of comic strips with other characters without links with Monica and Jimmy Five, like Zezinho and Hiroshi (now called Chuck Billy 'n' Folks), The Cavern Clan, Bug-a-Booo, The Tribe and Rapos\u00e3o (now called Lionel's Kingdom).\n\nThe characters only returned to be published in a monthly comic book from 1970, by publisher Abril, initially under the title of \"M\u00f4nica e Sua Turma\" (Monica and Her Gang), later being changed to \"M\u00f4nica\" and \"Turma da M\u00f4nica\" (Monica's Gang), the latter title used only for merchandising. With so many of the characters ever created by Mauricio in strips of newspaper also began to appear in the comics of Monica's Gang. At that time the area of comics was more competitive in Brazil, many Brazilian artists were trying to hold his own in the stalls along the publications of American comics like Donald Duck, Jos\u00e9 Carioca, Little Lulu, and many others. Even with these new comics, Monica's Gang remained with their good sales on newsstands and with this soon came to the Jimmy Five's solo comic book three years later. Sales were great and with that a contract with the footballer Pel\u00e9 was made for the launch of a character based on him, the Pelezinho, which was a phenomenon among children at the time, marking time in the history of Brazilian comics. Pelezinho was one of the few black characters made by Maur\u00edcio, and his design wasn't the most flattering to the black community, with a pale colored circle around the character's mouth to represent his lips, a concept made infamous by the black face depiction of African people. In late 2013, however, Pelezinho's design was updated to reflect more modern sensibilities.The staff of cartoonists has grown, leading to the foundation of the Est\u00fadios Maur\u00edcio de Sousa, that produce comics with the characters created by Mauricio de Sousa, and other marketing projects and cartoons of the characters. The first attempts to make a Monica and Friends cartoon occurred in the late 60s during a deal with Cica food company that produced some commercials for television, these being commercial who originated the character Thunder, who is currently a main character of the Lionel's Kingdom stories. The first film was only released in 1982, As Aventuras da Turma da M\u00f4nica which was produced in partnership with Black & White & Color and distributed by Embrafilme.\nOver the years, other characters  gained  their own comic books, like Smudge (1982), Chuck Billy (1982) and Maggy (1989). Other media have strengthened over the years and Monica-branded merchandise were launched, with products like books, toys, discs, CD-ROM and video games. A Monica-themed amusement park was created in 1993 in S\u00e3o Paulo, titled \"Parque da M\u00f4nica\" (Monica Park).

It is considered a classic work of political cinema and has been described as \"one of the most important references in the documentary genre\".Mis\u00e8re au Borinage was shot in black and white and is a silent film with intertitles in French and Dutch. It opens with a title card, bearing the slogan: \"Crisis in the Capitalist World. Factories are closed down, abandoned.

The film then shifts to the Borinage, an industrial region in Belgium's Hainaut Province, during and after the general strike of 1932. The majority of the film focuses on the plight of Borinage coal miners who have been evicted from their houses and made unemployed following their participation in the strike.

Haiti is 27,750 km2 (10,714 sq mi), the third largest country in the Caribbean, and has an estimated population of 11.4 million, making it the most populous Caribbean country. The capital is Port-au-Prince.\nThe island was originally inhabited by the Ta\u00edno people. The first Europeans arrived in December 1492 during the first voyage of Christopher Columbus. Columbus founded the first European settlement in the Americas, La Navidad, on what is now the northeastern coast of Haiti. The island was claimed by Spain, forming part of the Spanish Empire until the early 17th century. Competing claims and settlements led to the west of the island being ceded to France in 1697, which was subsequently named Saint-Domingue. French colonists established sugarcane plantations, worked by enslaved persons brought from Africa, which made the colony one of the world's richest.\nIn the midst of the French Revolution, enslaved persons, maroons, and free people of color launched the Haitian Revolution (1791\u20131804), led by a former slave and general of the French Army, Toussaint Louverture. Napoleon's forces were defeated by Louverture's successor, Jean-Jacques Dessalines (later Emperor Jacques I), who declared Haiti's sovereignty on 1 January 1804, leading to a massacre of the French. The country became the first independent nation of the Caribbean, the second republic in the Americas, the first country in the Americas to officially abolish slavery, and only country established by a slave revolt. President Jean-Pierre Boyer decided to invade and occupy Santo Domingo in February 1822, which eventually led to the long Haitian\u2013Dominican war. Defeated, Haiti recognized Dominican independence in 1867, following their declaration in 1844. Haiti's first century of independence was characterized by political instability, ostracism by the international community, payment of a crippling debt to France and the vast cost of the war and the occupation of Santo Domingo. Political volatility and foreign economic influence prompted the US to occupy the country between 1915 and 1934. The last contingent of US Marines departed on August 15, 1934, after a formal transfer of authority to the Garde and Ha\u00efti regained its independance. Fran\u00e7ois 'Papa Doc' Duvalier took power in 1957, ushering in a long period of autocratic rule continued by his son, Jean-Claude 'Baby Doc' Duvalier, that lasted until 1986; the period was characterized by state-sanctioned violence against the opposition and civilians, corruption, and economic stagnation. The country endured a 2004 coup d'\u00e9tat, which prompted U.N. intervention, as well as a catastrophic earthquake in 2010 that killed over 250,000 people and a cholera outbreak. Many countries canceled Haiti's debt, including France and the United States. With its deteriorating economic situation, Haiti has experienced a socioeconomic and political crisis marked by riots and protests, widespread hunger, and increased gang activity.

{"id": "462_86", "question": "What is the color of Panic in Year Zero!?", "ctxs": [{"id": "136_37240", "text": "Album opener \"Body Shots\" serves as an introduction to the style of the album. The song is barely one minute in length, compared to the duration of the majority of the songs on the album which are around four minutes long. The song contains singing by Donnelly that is largely scream-based, with guitar riffing taking influence from thrash metal. The track showcases guitarist Steve Bonnell's math rock-driven and largely melodic riffs that dominate the opening song. \"Body Shots\" has been described as a trailer for the rest of the album; the overall tone and energy of the song has been cited as a teaser for the rest of the album.The next song, \"Panic in the Year Zero\",  boasts a chorus that invokes the Iron Maiden song \"Run to the Hills\". The song has been called epic in nature, with guitar playing influenced by the playing of Omar Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez. Donnelly's vocal performance has been compared to that of Bruce Dickinson on the song. The song waltzes over topics like the apocalypse and features Donnelly singing \"say your prayers\" in a multitude of ways. Steven Bishop of Hybrid Magazine views that \"Year Zero\" showcases some of the lighter themes of the album, summarizing:\n\n\"Believe me, there is nothing like a female singer who can step up and belt out the lines, yet has enough Sauv\u00e9 Fair to finesse the lighter side of the material, and \"Panic In The Year Zero\" is a perfect example of that. If the vocals are the constancy, the guitar is the meat and potatoes, delivering resounding lines that drive the material and vary the intensity nicely; one moment giving meaningful power chords, the next moving with an asynchronous line. The bass uses space appropriately, developing astute lines that emphasize relationships to the drums here and the guitar there, always keeping it interesting.\"\n\n\"Serial Killers Know How to Party\" is tongue-in-cheek and somewhat comical in nature, heavily influences by horror films. Donnelly shouts \"your screams could raise the dead\" over a fast-paced guitar riff. \"Centaur: Half-Man Half-Motorcycle\" is reinforced with a double-bass panel, a technique that allows the drumming to sound more clear. Both \"Centaur: Half-Man Half-Motorcycle\" and \"Battlestar Anorexia\" channel some of the thematic similarities as the act Betty Blowtorch. On \"They Live\", Donelly boasts the line \"come with me, you pretty thing, and we'll celebrate with amputations.\" The song is named from the John Carpenter film, They Live. \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\" features a foreboding atmosphere, fueled by a progressive math-rock style of production, with some disco influences as well.\"Funeral Parlor Tricks\" features widely different styles of production during its running time. \"Nothing Cleanses Quite Like a Fire\" and album closer \"The Girl Who Was Born Without a Face\" relay themes of pulp violence.", "hasanswer": false}]}

But the difficulty to fabricate the colors on the uniform during those times forced a board meeting a year after the club's foundation. Pel\u00facio Paul suggested switching the official colors to white and black. According to Paul, the color white represents peace and black represents nobility. It received wide approval from the club members and the president of Santos, Raymundo Marques, based the club on the new colors.\nSince the club's foundation, Santos have had eight main crests, though all underwent minor variations. In 1912, Santos adopted a black and white striped shield, with one of the early leather footballs in the middle and a diagonal band with the letters \"SFBC\". In order to pay homage to Conc\u00f3rdia Club (who let Santos use their headquarters to plan its foundation), the club used a crest that incorporated three golden lemon letters, the letters S, F and C, in the center of an azure blue circle. At the end of 1912, the crest was remade with a white band around the circle. The white band was surrounded by a golden lemon border. The letters were colored white with golden lemon serving as its outside borders. Due to the difficulty of creating these colors consistently, the crest was rebranded to a white badge with black borders and the letters 'SFC' colored black.Later in 1913, the crest was redesigned as a badge inside a globe showing longitude and latitude lines as well as the equator. The badge had a black, diagonal band with \"S.F.C.\" in white text. The top half above the band was white with a leather ball at the top left corner. The bottom half was a black and white striped background. Above the badge was a crown. During 1915, the club temporarily changed its name to Uni\u00e3o Futebol Clube and were forced to create a temporary crest for that year. The crest was an escutcheon with a white band that read 'Uni\u00e3o F.C.' and a black background. In 1925, the globe and crown were removed from the crest and it took its future form, only going through a remodelling in 2005.On December 27, 2022, the club added a crown to the crest in honor of Pel\u00e9 (that would die two days after), the honor is positioned above the crest, between the two stars referring to the Intercontinental Cup titles in 1962 and 1963. The honor was proposed in the new statute, which was approved in November.

Art Modell admitted to ESPN's Roy Firestone that the Ravens' colors, introduced in early 1996, were inspired by the Northwestern Wildcats 1995 dream season. Helmets are black with purple \"talon\" stripes rising from the facemask to the crown. Players normally wear purple jerseys at home and white jerseys on the road. In 1996 the team wore black pants with a single large white stripe for all games.In 1997 the Ravens opted for a more classic NFL look with white pants sporting stripes in purple and black, along with the jerseys sporting a different font for the uniform numbers. The white pants were worn with both home and road jerseys. The road uniform (white pants with white jerseys) was worn by the Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV, at the end of the 2000 NFL season. This all-white combination was originally worn with black socks, but starting in 2021, the Ravens began wearing white hosiery with the all-white uniform.\nIn the 2002 season the Ravens began the practice of wearing white jerseys for the home opener that has a 1:00 kickoff. In recent seasons, the practice has come when the home game is played in week one. Since John Harbaugh became the head coach in 2008, the Ravens have also worn their white jerseys at home for preseason games.\nIn November 2004 the team introduced an alternate uniform design featuring black jerseys and solid black pants with black socks. The all-black uniform was first worn for a home game against the Cleveland Browns, entitled \"Pitch Black\" night, that resulted in a Ravens win. The uniform has since been worn for select prime-time national game broadcasts and other games of significance.\nThe Ravens began wearing black pants again with the white jersey in 2008. On December 7, 2008, during a Sunday Night Football game against the Washington Redskins, the Ravens introduced a new combination of black jersey with white pants. It was believed to be due to the fact that John Harbaugh doesn't like the \"blackout\" look. However, on December 19, 2010, the Ravens wore their black jerseys and black pants in a 30\u201324 victory over the New Orleans Saints.Since 2010, the Ravens have worn their black jerseys at least twice each season. From 2011 to 2013 and again in 2015, they wore the all blacks once and the black on white once. In 2014 and 2016, they wore all black both times they wore alternate uniforms. In 2017, they wore all black twice and black on white once (although the league is supposed to limit teams to wearing alternate jerseys a maximum of two times a season).\nOn December 5, 2010, the Ravens reverted to the black pants with the purple jerseys versus the Pittsburgh Steelers during NBC's Sunday Night Football telecast. The Ravens lost to the Steelers 13\u201310. They wore the same look again for their game against the Cleveland Browns on December 24, 2011, and they won, 20\u201314. They wore this combination a third time against the Houston Texans on January 15, 2012, in the AFC Divisional playoff. They won 20\u201313. They would again wear this combination on January 6, 2013, during the AFC Wild Card playoff and what turned out to be Ray Lewis' final home game, where they defeated the Indianapolis Colts 24\u20139.\nFrom their inaugural season until 2006, the Ravens wore white cleats with their uniforms; they switched to black cleats in 2007. From the mid-2010s onward, the NFL relaxed its rules regarding primary cleat colors, and Ravens players began wearing customized cleats in either purple, black, gold or white.\nOn December 20, 2015, the team unexpectedly debuted gold pants for the first time, wearing them with their regular purple jerseys against the Kansas City Chiefs. Although gold is an official accent color of the Ravens, the pants got an overwhelmingly negative response on social media by both Ravens fans and fans of other NFL teams, with some comparisons being made to the rival Pittsburgh Steelers' pants, and mustard.During the 2015 season, the NFL announced a jersey promotion called Color Rush in which teams would wear uniforms typically of one color head-to-toe during select prime-time games. The promotion was used three times that season; all the games that featured them were on Thursday Night and had both teams wear them in each. The following season, the league released uniforms for all 32 teams and announced they would be worn during all Thursday Night games that year, as well as on Christmas. The Ravens had one Thursday Night game in 2016; they wore their all-purple Color Rush uniforms and won 28\u20137 over the division rival Cleveland Browns. They had one other Thursday Night game the following season, in which they again wore the jerseys and won 40\u20130 over the Miami Dolphins. In their Christmas 2016 game against the Steelers, the Ravens wore their regular all-white uniforms while their rivals wore their Color Rush uniforms.\nOn September 13, 2018, the Ravens debuted a new combination in a road game against the Cincinnati Bengals, wearing white jerseys with purple pants. The purple pants are similar to the ones used for Color Rush except that it has side stripes of black and white; the Color Rush purple pants have gold and white stripes. Then on October 21 against the New Orleans Saints, the Ravens paired their new purple pants with their regular purple uniforms. Black socks were originally worn with this combination, but on January 2, 2022, the Ravens wore purple socks with the regular all-purple combination against the Los Angeles Rams, essentially replicating their Color Rush uniforms but with minimal gold elements.\nFor the regular season finale against the Browns on December 30, the Ravens wore their black uniforms with purple pants. The Ravens wore this combination again October 11, 2021, against the Indianapolis Colts on Monday Night Football in a 31\u201325 overtime win.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Scott of The New York Times wrote that the film was \"sly, daring, genuinely original and at times perversely brilliant\", while also stating that it was  \"a singularly unpleasant movie\" that had \"scramble[d his] signals ... effectively, overriding deeply ingrained habits of response and judgment.\" Eric Kohn of Indiewire praised the film, writing that it was \"a sheer delight of sarcasm and uneasy wit.\"Writing in The Village Voice, Nick Pinkerton described The Color Wheel as \"a movie that's consistently unafraid to get confrontational and plain weird, with Colin's is-it-or-isn't-it-ironic racism, abrupt smothering close-ups, and scenes pushed past the boundaries of plausible motivation until they nosedive into absurdity.

The film cost only $141,659, yet brought in almost $4 million in its first two years and saved the studio from financial disaster. RKO wanted to move quickly on a sequel to build on the success of Cat People, but producer Val Lewton wished to make the fantasy-comedy story \"The Amorous Ghost\" instead. As Lewton and studio wrangled, Lewton commenced production on The Seventh Victim, a horror-murder mystery film, and on May 12, 1943, RKO announced it was delaying production on the sequel The Curse of the Cat People due to the unavailability of key performers. RKO production chief Charles Koerner did not want Lewton to be idle once filming on The Seventh Victim ended nor did he favor the idea of Lewton working on comedy, so Koerner suggested that Lewton direct a horror film set at sea, utilizing the studio's existing ship set, built for Pacific Liner (1939). According to Robert Wise, a longtime collaborator with Lewton, it was this set that gave Lewton the idea for the film. \"He would find what we call a 'standing set,' and then tailor his script to the set, whatever it was. That's how he made The Ghost Ship. He walked onto a set and saw a tanker, then cooked up the idea for this ship with a murderous captain.\" One scholar has suggested that Lewton accepted the assignment in part because, as an amateur sailor himself, the ship captain's behavior mirrored Lewton's own views on how to manage a ship, but also because Lewton saw the plot as a way of criticizing his micro-managing superiors at RKO. The budget, as with all of Lewton's films, was set at $150,000.\nAt the time screenwriting began, Lewton claimed that the idea for the film was an original one attributable to himself. Leo Mittler did the treatment and Donald Henderson Clarke wrote the script, although Lewton significantly revised the screenplay and wrote many lines of dialogue himself.Mark Robson was assigned to direct in June 1943. Robson was the RKO director \"most in tune with [Lewton's] idea of psychological terror\". Robson had just finished editing Orson Welles' Journey Into Fear, and there are distinct stylistic similarities between the two films. Robson and Lewton chose to use single-source lighting throughout the film in order to make the sets and performances more interesting, and sets were designed to utilize this type of lighting. The two men also agreed to continue Lewton's emphasis on unseen and implied terror. Cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca, art directors Albert S. D'Agostino and Walter E. Keller, and composer Roy Webb all regularly worked with Lewton, and did so on The Ghost Ship as well. Richard Dix was cast because he was already on contract with RKO to do several \"quickie\" pictures at a set fee per film, and doing The Ghost Ship would help fulfill his contract without much effort. Russell Wade had provided a disembodied voice in The Leopard Man, and this was his first starring role in a Lewton production. His performance here led him to be cast in Lewton's later The Body Snatcher (1945). Edith Barrett, Ben Bard, Dewey Robinson, and Charles Lung all had worked with Lewton before. Future film noir star Lawrence Tierney, whom Lewton had seen modeling clothing in a Sears, Roebuck catalog, made his motion picture debut in the movie. Sir Lancelot, a well-known calypso singer, who later influenced the career of Harry Belafonte, had already appeared in singing roles in three prior films (including I Walked with a Zombie). Atmosphere is created in the film by the contrast between murder and the joviality of the calypso songs sung on board.\nProduction began on 3 August 1943. Many details about the performances, lighting, camera angles, action, and effects were worked out ahead of time in order to not only keep the film under budget but also help achieve suspense on such a low budget. Dr. Jared Criswell, former pastor of the Fifth Avenue Spiritualist Church of New York City, served as a technical consultant on the film regarding psychic phenomena. The picture's final fight scene between the Finn, Pollo, and the mad Captain was shot on a dimly lit set to heighten the suspense and keep the audience from guessing who the victor might be, similar to the way Jacques Tourneur and Lewton had shot a similar scene in Cat People.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Arnold. It was made on a very low budget, with no retakes except in cases where the actual film stock became damaged; it was shot over a period of three weeks, often filming well into the night. Actress Hazel Court later said: \"I remember great fun on the set. It was like a repertory company acting that film\".The robot, named Chani, was constructed by Jack Whitehead and was operated by a human being.The alien Klaatu, posing as  \"Mr. Carpenter\" in The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), was intended by screenwriter Edmund H.

{"id": "462_100", "question": "What is the color of Father of a Soldier?", "ctxs": [{"id": "4647_17005", "text": "Throughout the play, Sartre characteristically colors the text of the plot with his philosophic concepts, especially the notions of responsibility and freedom and the contrast between bad faith and authenticity. Some of these comments serve a functional or descriptive role in the plot while simultaneously carrying a philosophic aside. Others are closer to the typical philosophic dialogue, elaborating the characters as they address an issue.\n\nIn Act One, Father and Werner discuss the power to command others. Werner: When I look a man in the eyes I become incapable of giving him orders... I feel that he is my equal.  Father: To obey and to command is the same thing. In both cases you transmit orders you have received.  Werner: You receive orders?  Father: Up to quite recently, I did.  Werner: From whom? Father: I don't know. Myself, perhaps. (Smiling.. I'll give you the formula. If you want to command, think of yourself as someone else...  Werner: I'm lucky, in fact. [Gelber] will give the orders.  Father: Gelber? You're mad! He is your employee. You pay him to let you know what orders to give. Here Sartre shows Father's power to stem from a self-deception Werner does not possess: Father claims his ability to command comes from his receiving of orders, despite the fact they are his own. Yet he opposes Werner's proposition, despite its being practically and essentially the same thing: he employs Gelber to employ himself. Similar examples occur in Being and Nothingness, where Sartre shows two groups to be in bad faith for different reasons. The choice of the name Gelber here is a possible pun: Gelb is German for the color \"yellow\", which in English can also mean \"cowardly\".\nAlso in Act One, Sartre's ideas of freedom and \"existence precedes essence\" are illustrated in Johanna's outburst to Father von Gerlach: \"... I declare that I will not make any confessions for the simple reason that I have none to make. I am alone, with out strength and completely aware of my powerlessness.\"\nIn the second act, Leni asks Franz why he has not conceded to the crabs every right but the right to condemn him. He claims his exemption as a witness for the defense. Leni objects: \"Challenge their competence, I beg you; it's your only weakness. Tell them \"You are not my judges,: and you'll have no one to fear - either in this world or the next.\" Leni later addresses the crabs directly: \"...you will condemn us outright, but I couldn't care less.\" \"...I forbid [Franz] to plead my cause. I have only one judge - myself - and I acquit myself. Oh, witness for the defense, testify before yourself. You will be invulnerable if you dare to state: \"I have done what I wanted, and I want what I have done.\"\n\nLater, Franz describes Johanna's beauty as a nothingness to his crabs: \"What calm! She is quiet. It's all there, comrades: \"Be beautiful and keep quiet!\" A vision. Is it inscribed on your window? Oh, no! What could be inscribed on it? Nothing has changed; nothing has happened. The trick brought nothing into the room, that's all. Emptiness, a diamond that cuts no glass, an absence, beauty. You'll see nothing but the blaze there, poor Crustaceans. You took our eyes to examine what exists, while we, living in man's epoch, have seen with those same eyes what does not exist.\" Franz's words imply that the crabs cannot see a nothingness, a term Sartre uses to describe value- and structure-/role- judgments which are not inherent to an object's being, but rather given to them by consciousness.\nAnother conversation depicts Sartre's \"Man is a useless passion\":  \"Franz (ironic admiration): [A] Star! And you didn't succeed? What did you want?\" Johanna: \"What does one want? Everything.\" F (slowly): \"Everything, yes. Nothing else. All or nothing.\" (Laughing) \"Turned out badly, eh?\"  J: \"Always does.\"\nSartre considers the possibility that the German soldiers themselves were guilty of enabling Nazi war crimes: \"[Klages, a German lieutenant] was the champion of mental reservation. He condemned the Nazis in spirit to hide the fact that he was serving them in the flesh... He said to God: \"I don't like what I'm doing.\" But he did it.\" This motif of universal responsibility is repeated by Franz and other characters in different forms throughout the play, notably by the dying woman in the flashback of Act Four.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Art Modell admitted to ESPN's Roy Firestone that the Ravens' colors, introduced in early 1996, were inspired by the Northwestern Wildcats 1995 dream season. Helmets are black with purple \"talon\" stripes rising from the facemask to the crown. Players normally wear purple jerseys at home and white jerseys on the road. In 1996 the team wore black pants with a single large white stripe for all games.In 1997 the Ravens opted for a more classic NFL look with white pants sporting stripes in purple and black, along with the jerseys sporting a different font for the uniform numbers. The white pants were worn with both home and road jerseys. The road uniform (white pants with white jerseys) was worn by the Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV, at the end of the 2000 NFL season. This all-white combination was originally worn with black socks, but starting in 2021, the Ravens began wearing white hosiery with the all-white uniform.\nIn the 2002 season the Ravens began the practice of wearing white jerseys for the home opener that has a 1:00 kickoff. In recent seasons, the practice has come when the home game is played in week one. Since John Harbaugh became the head coach in 2008, the Ravens have also worn their white jerseys at home for preseason games.\nIn November 2004 the team introduced an alternate uniform design featuring black jerseys and solid black pants with black socks. The all-black uniform was first worn for a home game against the Cleveland Browns, entitled \"Pitch Black\" night, that resulted in a Ravens win. The uniform has since been worn for select prime-time national game broadcasts and other games of significance.\nThe Ravens began wearing black pants again with the white jersey in 2008. On December 7, 2008, during a Sunday Night Football game against the Washington Redskins, the Ravens introduced a new combination of black jersey with white pants. It was believed to be due to the fact that John Harbaugh doesn't like the \"blackout\" look. However, on December 19, 2010, the Ravens wore their black jerseys and black pants in a 30\u201324 victory over the New Orleans Saints.Since 2010, the Ravens have worn their black jerseys at least twice each season. From 2011 to 2013 and again in 2015, they wore the all blacks once and the black on white once. In 2014 and 2016, they wore all black both times they wore alternate uniforms. In 2017, they wore all black twice and black on white once (although the league is supposed to limit teams to wearing alternate jerseys a maximum of two times a season).\nOn December 5, 2010, the Ravens reverted to the black pants with the purple jerseys versus the Pittsburgh Steelers during NBC's Sunday Night Football telecast. The Ravens lost to the Steelers 13\u201310. They wore the same look again for their game against the Cleveland Browns on December 24, 2011, and they won, 20\u201314. They wore this combination a third time against the Houston Texans on January 15, 2012, in the AFC Divisional playoff. They won 20\u201313. They would again wear this combination on January 6, 2013, during the AFC Wild Card playoff and what turned out to be Ray Lewis' final home game, where they defeated the Indianapolis Colts 24\u20139.\nFrom their inaugural season until 2006, the Ravens wore white cleats with their uniforms; they switched to black cleats in 2007. From the mid-2010s onward, the NFL relaxed its rules regarding primary cleat colors, and Ravens players began wearing customized cleats in either purple, black, gold or white.\nOn December 20, 2015, the team unexpectedly debuted gold pants for the first time, wearing them with their regular purple jerseys against the Kansas City Chiefs. Although gold is an official accent color of the Ravens, the pants got an overwhelmingly negative response on social media by both Ravens fans and fans of other NFL teams, with some comparisons being made to the rival Pittsburgh Steelers' pants, and mustard.During the 2015 season, the NFL announced a jersey promotion called Color Rush in which teams would wear uniforms typically of one color head-to-toe during select prime-time games. The promotion was used three times that season; all the games that featured them were on Thursday Night and had both teams wear them in each. The following season, the league released uniforms for all 32 teams and announced they would be worn during all Thursday Night games that year, as well as on Christmas. The Ravens had one Thursday Night game in 2016; they wore their all-purple Color Rush uniforms and won 28\u20137 over the division rival Cleveland Browns. They had one other Thursday Night game the following season, in which they again wore the jerseys and won 40\u20130 over the Miami Dolphins. In their Christmas 2016 game against the Steelers, the Ravens wore their regular all-white uniforms while their rivals wore their Color Rush uniforms.\nOn September 13, 2018, the Ravens debuted a new combination in a road game against the Cincinnati Bengals, wearing white jerseys with purple pants. The purple pants are similar to the ones used for Color Rush except that it has side stripes of black and white; the Color Rush purple pants have gold and white stripes. Then on October 21 against the New Orleans Saints, the Ravens paired their new purple pants with their regular purple uniforms. Black socks were originally worn with this combination, but on January 2, 2022, the Ravens wore purple socks with the regular all-purple combination against the Los Angeles Rams, essentially replicating their Color Rush uniforms but with minimal gold elements.\nFor the regular season finale against the Browns on December 30, the Ravens wore their black uniforms with purple pants. The Ravens wore this combination again October 11, 2021, against the Indianapolis Colts on Monday Night Football in a 31\u201325 overtime win.", "hasanswer": false}]}

For decades, it was the most successful American magazine to publish ad-free, beginning with issue No. 33 (April 1957) and continuing through issue No. 402 (February 2001).\nAs a comic book, Mad had run the same advertisements as the rest of EC's line. The magazine later made a deal with Moxie soda that involved inserting the Moxie logo into various articles. Mad ran a limited number of ads in its first two years as a magazine, helpfully labeled \"real advertisement\" to differentiate the real from the parodies. The last authentic ad published under the original Mad regime was for Famous Artists School; two issues later, the inside front cover of issue No. 34 had a parody of the same ad. After this transitional period, the only promotions to appear in Mad for decades were house ads for Mad's own books and specials, subscriptions, and promotional items such as ceramic busts, T-shirts, or a line of Mad jewelry. This rule was bent only a few times to promote outside products directly related to the magazine, such as The Mad Magazine Game, a series of video games based on Spy vs. Spy, and the notorious Up the Academy movie (which the magazine later disowned). Mad explicitly promised that it would never make its mailing list available.\nBoth Kurtzman and Feldstein wanted the magazine to solicit advertising, feeling this could be accomplished without compromising Mad's content or editorial independence. Kurtzman remembered Ballyhoo, a boisterous 1930s humor publication that made an editorial point of mocking its own sponsors. Feldstein went so far as to propose an in-house Mad ad agency, and produced a \"dummy\" copy of what an issue with ads could look like. But Bill Gaines was intractable, telling the television news magazine 60 Minutes, \"We long ago decided we couldn't take money from Pepsi-Cola and make fun of Coca-Cola.\" Gaines' motivation in eschewing ad dollars was less philosophical than practical:\n\nWe'd have to improve our package. Most advertisers want to appear in a magazine that's loaded with color and has super-slick paper. So you find yourself being pushed into producing a more expensive package. You get bigger and fancier and attract more advertisers. Then you find you're losing some of your advertisers. Your readers still expect the fancy package, so you keep putting it out, but now you don't have your advertising income, which is why you got fancier in the first place\u2014and now you're sunk.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Roger Corman was attracted to the project because in the original draft of the script, the monster was invisible, which meant the film could be done cheaply. Executive producer Sam Arkoff insisted on a visible monster and space ship, but there was very little in the budget to realize these effects. Corman's original idea was an alien that was an ethereal force incapable of being seen.\nIn April 1955, it was announced in Variety the film would be the first for Pacemaker Productions, a new company formed by Roger Corman. By that stage, the film had been renamed The Beast with a Million Eyes by Corman's distributor James Nicholson. To circumvent union rules, it would be produced and directed by David Kamarsky, Corman's former aide, while Corman would executive produce. Paul Birch's casting was announced in April 1955.This film was Dona Cole's only on-screen credit, having appeared uncredited in Daddy Long Legs (1955) and The Long Grey Line (1955).The Beast with a Million Eyes was the third of a three-picture deal Roger Corman had with the American Releasing Company following The Fast and the Furious (1955) and Five Guns West (1955). Reportedly, cost over-runs on Five Guns West meant only about $29,000 remained to make the science fiction film for Pacemaker Productions.The title, Beast with a Million Eyes, reportedly came from American Releasing Company president James H. Nicholson. His lurid title and poster had film exhibitors signed on before seeing the finished film. The \"million eyes\" of the title refers to the alien's ability to see through the eyes of the animals and people it controls by inhabiting their bodies.Reportedly, The Beast with a Million Eyes was a non-union filming of a script originally titled The Unseen, with Lou Place set to direct. After one day's filming, the union threatened to shut down the production unless everyone signed with the Guild. With production running overtime, Roger Corman took over the film's directing chores and replaced the cinematographer with Floyd Crosby; but Corman took no official screen credit.Filming took place in Indio and the Coachella Valley, California. Corman shot 48 pages of interiors in just two days at a studio on La Cienega Blvd. in Los Angeles.The movie is also infamous for its exaggerated promotional poster.

This corruption is illustrated through examples of needs: a village needs a road and a hospital, a graveyard that needs a wall, and people that need toilets. In addition, the book describes the ways individuals navigated their business and how the government meets those needs. The book examines the role of intermediaries in the Indian political scenario and how they function in the government settings.\nThe book contrasts the lives of the anonymous poor with those of the rich and famous, and how the wealth gap undermines democratic processes. It reports on the flourishing phenomenon of middlemen who facilitate access to decision makers and manipulate government decisions. It is suggested that \"a whole caste of middlemen\" sustains and perpetuates corruption in India. It is prevalent from the lowest police post to the offices of the prime minister and president.A particular segment of the economy is examined to show how democratic institutions are easily manipulated by ambitious and well-funded businessmen, who seek preferential treatment directly or through intermediaries including organized crime figures. Through a detailed investigation, the author provides his own evidence, arguing that some of modern India's most successful entrepreneurs have thrived through bribes, manipulation, and possibly even murder.In the final segment of the book, Joseph argues that India's elite are the beneficiaries of corruption, using their financial and political clout to steer policy-making and legislation..

Nemo, a nine-year-old boy, has been thrust into a position where he must make an impossible decision\u2014to choose between his mother and father. In the seconds preceding the rest of his life, he wonders where each choice will take him. The forces of the universe working to bring about total chaos are counteracted by this boy's overactive imagination. The dilemma that causes the film's main problem (not knowing the future), once solved, makes it all the more difficult: \"I don't know the future, therefore I cannot make a decision. Now that I know the future I still cannot make one.\" The eloquent interplay between philosophical lifestyle and what forges reality is epitomized by the way the film constantly jumps between scenes of the young boy, the adolescent, and the mature man. The film takes a four-dimensionalist view of the nature and existence of life in the universe, with each decision branching off to create an entirely separate alternate universe. Mr. Nobody raises many ontological arguments about the subjective nature of time and investigates how actions have universal consequences, and how every single choice, irrespective of its simplicity or complexity, can make, alter, or change a lifetime.The film also makes substantial use of chaos theory, string theory, and the butterfly effect to accentuate the lack of control that humans, as individuals, possess. There are numerous scenes, at each stage of his life, where Nemo is subject to the whims of chance, often plunging into water, a place where humans lack control, as a visual symbol of the powerlessness attributed to the human condition. The theories are used to compound reality in the film, a reality in which time always moves in one direction\u2014the smoke never goes back into the cigarette. Then, at the end, when it seems the universe is on the precipice of ultimate chaos, making use of the Big Crunch theory, time halts and begins to reverse. This brings the freedom from choice Nemo had been seeking, for, as Nemo says in the film, \"as long as you don't choose, everything remains possible.\" The tale of Nemo Nobody reflects a life of choices, whether or not we made the correct choices, and what would happen if we could go back and change them. In the end, Mr. Nobody, at age 118, states that it doesn't matter what we choose, because each choice, once made, has just as much significance as any alternate choice would have. The film portrays a life where we are all subject to chance, the dimensions by which we construct our reality (height, length, width, and time), and the imagination of our former selves, and, once the boy Nemo knows the outcome of a given choice, he instinctively opts for another.The different colors used in the film have symbolic meanings. Each of the three main storylines has its own unique hue that highlights its originality and unlikeness to the others. The color differentiation can be traced as far back as Nemo's childhood, where his possible future wives, Jean, Elise, and Anna, sit on a bench, wearing yellow, blue, and red dresses, respectively. In his life with Jean, Nemo seeks material well-being and independence, and yellow\u2014the color of life and wealth\u2014emphasizes this. Choosing Elise, Nemo experiences the consequences of depression and despair, which are themes associated with the color blue. Finally, the true love and passionate relationship between Nemo and Anna is symbolized by the red color of Anna's dress. It is also noteworthy that the unborn Nemo is shown living in a white world, as white contains all colors of the visible spectrum, which supports the allegorical message of the film that all things are possible until a choice is made. At the end of his life, Nemo is a decrepit old man and lives in a white surrounding (room, clothes, doctor), indicating that the fate of the protagonist leads him back to his origins\u2014the point at which everything is possible.The idea of a child learning about their whole life in the womb only to have an angel take the memory away is a reference to the Jewish concept of Lailah, the Angel of Conception, and it also bears a resemblance to the Myth of Er as found in the Republic.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The website's critical consensus reads, \"The epitome of so-bad-it's-good cinema, Plan 9 from Outer Space is an unintentionally hilarious sci-fi 'thriller' from anti-genius Ed Wood that is justly celebrated for its staggering ineptitude.\" On Metacritic, the film received a score of 56 based on 13 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".Josiah Teal of Film Threat gave the film a 10/10, calling it a \"quintessential cult classic\" and writing that it is a \"testament to a love of cinema and making all the wrong creative choices.\" There are also claims that Wood managed to convey some interesting ideas. The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, for instance, claims that \"the film's reception modulated away from jovial mockery of its wanton indifference to normal professional standards of script, performance, and effects, in favour of a more nuanced appreciation of its dreamlike narrative assemblage of genre tropes, resonantly unspeakable dialogue, and irrepressible budgetary ingenuity.\"As of 2021, Plan 9 had failed to place in the IMDb Bottom 100, a list compiled using average scores given by Internet Movie Database users, though some of Wood's other movies had.

Eventually, Short dropped his claim and Twentieth Century-Fox was allowed to use the title. Short's production was never made. Several major studios were interested in producing films about the Underwater Demolition Teams, but only Twentieth Century-Fox obtained an exclusive guarantee of cooperation from the U.S. Navy.\nHenry Hathaway, one of the studio's most well received directors, was originally set to direct the film, which was to feature Millard Mitchell in a starring role. Richard Conte was also originally set to play \"Pete Vincent\", while Jack Elam was first cast as \"Sleepy\", and Craig Hill was set to play \"Lt. J. G. Franklin\". Assistant director Dick Mayberry briefly filled in for director Lloyd Bacon when Bacon fell ill with influenza.\nProducer Sam Engel wrote an original story, titled \"Frogmen in Korea\", as an intended follow-up to The Frogmen, but the project soon dissolved. A one-hour television remake of The Frogmen, titled Deep Water, was broadcast in May 1957 on The 20th Century Fox Hour. The program was directed by Roy Del Ruth and starred Ralph Meeker (Lawrence), James Whitmore (Flannigan), and Richard Arlen (Vincent).\nBecause working conditions for The  Frogmen were deemed too \"riotous\" for women, all female roles were written out of the screenplay and none appeared in the completed film.

It starred American rapper Mykki Blanco playing the role of a transgender Joan of Arc who gets burned at the stake. Madonna met Blanco through producer Mike Dean and became interested in working with her. After contacting her, Blanco flew to London and met her at her home. She had her listen to a finished version of the album and asked her to portray Joan of Arc in the video. Blanco is openly gay and HIV-positive, and Madonna felt she could relate to Joan's struggles; \"if you had existed as you in her time \u2014 you would have been burned at the stake as well\", she told her. According to Blanco, Madonna served as co-director and even worked on choreography, cinematography and costume design, but remained uncredited. On June 5, she shared two previews of the video on her Instagram account: one showed her wearing a veil, intercut with religious iconography, while the other depicted Blanco being burned.The video opens with a quote by Joan of Arc: \"One life is all we have and we live it as we believe in living it. But to sacrifice what you are and to live without belief, that is a fate more terrible than dying\". Told in a nonlinear narrative, it begins with Blanco held captive in a stone cell, she's wearing a dirty white robe with her wrists bound. She's then led by \"stone faced\" clergymen to her execution as she sings along to the lyrics. Blanco is then seen dancing, first in a cathedral wearing a gold corset, similar to the one Madonna wore on her Blond Ambition World Tour (1990), pleading with the men to spare her, and then at an altar. The final shot is of a naked Blanco, her head shaved off, being burned at the stake while a bunch of veiled nuns, one of them Madonna, look from below. The video ends with an \"inspiring\" quote from Blanco: \"I have walked this earth, Black, Queer and HIV positive, but no transgression against me has been as powerful as the hope I hold within\".It received positive reviews from critics. Althea Legaspi from Rolling Stone, called it \"cinematic\". Alexa Camp noted a \"blink-and-you'll-miss-it\" shot from Carl Theodor Dreyer's 1928 film The Passion of Joan of Arc at the very beginning. She also saw similarities to Madonna's 1989 video for \"Like a Prayer\", specifically in the use of religious imagery and the story revolving around a persecuted black person. Camp concluded that by casting a person of color and not herself as \"the oppressed\", Madonna was highlighting \"the disproportionate impact of the patriarchy on minorities\". For Paper's Justin Moran \"[Mykki Blanco's] take on Joan of Arc mirrors how his own everyday relishes the in-between\", also pointing out the singer's absence in the video. Mike Wass hailed the video as a \"gothic nightmare\" and \"eerie\". According to CNN's Chloe Melas, the video was \"fresh proof that Madonna has never been afraid to push the limits\".

In the dream, Lovecraft is visiting an antiquity museum in Providence, attempting to convince the aged curator there to buy an odd bas-relief Lovecraft himself had sculpted. The curator initially scoffs at him for trying to sell something recently made to a museum of antique objects. Lovecraft then remembers himself answering the curator:\n\nWhy do you say that this thing is new? The dreams of men are older than brooding Egypt or the contemplative Sphinx, or garden-girdled Babylon, and this was fashioned in my dreams.\nThis can be compared to what the character of Henry Anthony Wilcox tells the main character's uncle while showing him his sculpted bas-relief for help in reading hieroglyphs on it which came through Wilcox's own fantastical dreams:\n\nIt is new, indeed, for I made it last night in a dream of strange cities; and dreams are older than brooding Tyre or the contemplative Sphinx, or garden-girdled Babylon.\nLovecraft then used this for a brief synopsis of a new story outlined in his own Commonplace Book at first in August 1925, which developed organically out of the idea of what the bas-relief in the dream actually might have depicted. In a footnote for his writing down of his own dream, Lovecraft then finished with the suggestion \"Add good development & describe nature of bas-relief\" to himself for future reference.Cthulhu Mythos scholar Robert M. Price claims the irregular sonnet \"The Kraken\", published in 1830 by Alfred Tennyson, was a major inspiration, since both reference a huge aquatic creature sleeping for an eternity at the bottom of the ocean and destined to emerge from its slumber in an apocalyptic age.S. T. Joshi and David E. Schultz cited other literary inspirations: Guy de Maupassant's \"The Horla\" (1887), which Lovecraft described in Supernatural Horror in Literature as concerning \"an invisible being who...sways the minds of others, and seems to be the vanguard of a horde of extraterrestrial organisms arrived on Earth to subjugate and overwhelm mankind\"; and Arthur Machen's \"The Novel of the Black Seal\" (1895), which uses the same method of piecing together of disassociated knowledge (including a random newspaper clipping) to reveal the survival of a horrific ancient being.It is also assumed he got inspiration from William Scott-Elliot's The Story of Atlantis (1896) and The Lost Lemuria (1904), which Lovecraft read in 1926 shortly before he started to work on the story.Price also notes that Lovecraft admired the work of Lord Dunsany, who wrote The Gods of Pegana (1905), which depicts a god constantly lulled to sleep to avoid the consequences of its reawakening. Another Dunsany work cited by Price is A Shop in Go-by Street (1919), which stated \"the heaven of the gods who sleep\", and \"unhappy are they that hear some old god speak while he sleeps being still deep in slumber\".The \"slight earthquake\" mentioned in the story is likely the 1925 Charlevoix\u2013Kamouraska earthquake.S.T. Joshi has also cited A. Merritt's novella The Moon Pool (1918) which Lovecraft 'frequently rhapsodied about'. Joshi says that 'Merritt's mention of a \"moon-door\" that, when tilted, leads the characters into a lower region of wonder and horror seems similar to the huge door whose inadvertent opening by the sailors causes Cthulhu to emerge from R'lyeh'.Edward Guimont has argued that H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds was an influence on \"The Call of Cthulhu\", citing the thematic similarities of ancient, powerful, but indifferent aliens associated with deities; physical similarities between Cthulhu and the Martians; and the plot detail of a ship ramming an alien in a temporarily successful but ultimately futile gesture.", "hasanswer": false}]}

The dish which results is categorised according to the liquid content of the cooked coconut milk, which ranges from the most wet and soupy to the most dry: Gulai \u2014 Kalio \u2013 Rendang. The ingredients of gulai, kalio and rendang are almost identical with the exceptions that gulai usually has less red chilli pepper and more turmeric, while rendang has richer spices.\nIf pieces of meat are cooked in spicy coconut milk and the process stopped right when the meat is done and the coconut milk has reached its boiling point, the dish is called gulai. If the process continues until the coconut milk is partly evaporated and the meat has started to brown, the dish is called kalio. For traditional dry rendang, the process continues hours beyond this, until the liquid has all but completely evaporated and the color turns to a dark brown, almost black color. Thus not only liquid content but also color indicate which type of rendang is involved: gulai is light yellow, kalio is brown and rendang is very dark brown. Today, one mostly finds only two simpler categories of rendang: either dry or wet.\nAccording to Minangkabau tradition, their true rendang is the dry one. Although, unlike crispy dendeng balado spicy jerky, rendang's texture is not actually dry, since it is quite moist and rather oily. Rendang is diligently stirred, attended, and cooked for hours until the coconut milk has evaporated, turned into coconut oil, and the meat has absorbed the spices. It is still served for special ceremonial occasions or to honor guests. If cooked properly, dried rendang can last for three to four weeks stored at room temperature and is still good to consume. It can even last months stored in a refrigerator, and up to six months if frozen.", "hasanswer": false}]}

He begins his first day at the Love in Action gay conversion therapy assessment program in Memphis, Tennessee. \nChief therapist Victor Sykes tells the group that their sexuality is a choice influenced by poor parenting. He instructs them to perform harsh \"moral inventories\" of themselves and their families and requires them not to tell anyone else about what occurs during the sessions. While performing his moral inventory, Jared thinks of his life prior to entering the program. \nIn high school, he was happy, though he broke up with his girlfriend upon starting college. Once there, he became friends with another student, Henry. While staying the night in Jared's dorm room in bunk beds, Henry rapes Jared, apologizes and tearfully confesses doing the same to another young man. Traumatized, Jared returns home.\nHenry calls the Eamon home and poses as a school counselor in order to out Jared and ensure his silence. Jared tells his parents this was another student who had told him things about his past and was afraid of Jared revealing his secrets. Jared later agrees that he is attracted to men. After consulting with other pastors, Marshall prays over his son, and then signs him up for conversion therapy, to which Jared reluctantly agrees.\nNancy rents a nearby motel room for her and Jared to stay in until he completes the assessment; however, Jared soon discovers that the therapy has no set end point if he fails to convince Sykes that he has become heterosexual. Some students are confessing and playing the game so they can leave; others truly hope to change.\nJared tells his mother the program teaches the participants to see their parents as troubled and that is why they are not supposed to talk about what goes on to them, to safeguard the program's continued funding. Nancy insists Jared let her read the program's handbook, which contains questionable psychology and many grammatical and typographical errors.\nIt appears that Jared will be at the institution for some time. After failing an exercise, attendee Cameron is humiliated by Sykes in front of the group and intimidated with a fake funeral service. He is beaten with Bibles by both the therapists and his own family and is forcibly dunked in a bathtub as a horrified Jared looks on.\nReturning to his moral inventory, Jared thinks of a brief encounter he had with an art student in college. He uses it when it is his time to confess, but Sykes finds holding hands with a boy to be an inadequate admission and pushes him to give more explicit details. Jared says he will not lie, so Sykes pushes him to talk about Henry. He is shocked and refuses, so Sykes then attempts to make Jared \"use his anger\" and say he hates his father. Jared refuses to do this, as it is Sykes that he is angry with. \nJared storms out of the room, retrieves his phone and calls Nancy, begging her to pick him up. Sykes, his assistants and the other attendees corner him behind a locked door despite Nancy's presence. Cameron stands up for him and helps get Jared to Nancy, who takes him home.\nNancy is horrified that she has allowed her husband to enroll Jared in an unvetted program without researching its practices. Marshall remains adamant about Jared remaining in the program, but Nancy steadfastly overrules him. Soon after, Jared learns from the police, via his mother, that Cameron committed suicide while still in the program's care. Marshall approaches Jared to console him, but Jared turns away.\nFour years later, Jared is living in New York City with his boyfriend.

It has since been translated into 40 languages. The Vatican placed the book on its List of Prohibited Books. The sex researcher Alfred Kinsey was critical of The Second Sex, holding that while it was interesting as a work of literature, it was of no value to science. In 1960, Beauvoir wrote that The Second Sex was an attempt to explain \"why a woman's situation, still, even today, prevents her from exploring the world's basic problems.\" In a 1974 interview, she remembered that \"Camus was furious; he reacted with typical Mediterranean machismo, saying I had ridiculed the French male. Professors hurled the book across the room. People sniggered at me in restaurants. The fact [that] I had spoken about female sexuality was absolutely scandalous at the time. Men kept drawing attention to the vulgarity of the book, essentially because they were furious at what the book was suggesting\u2014equality between the sexes\". The attack on psychoanalysis in The Second Sex helped to inspire subsequent feminist arguments against psychoanalysis, including those of Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique (1963), Kate Millett's Sexual Politics (1969), and Germaine Greer's The Female Eunuch (1970). Millett commented in 1989 that she did not realize the extent to which she was influenced by Beauvoir when she wrote Sexual Politics.Philosopher Judith Butler argues that Beauvoir's formulation that \"One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman\" distinguishes the terms \"sex\" and \"gender\". Borde and Malovany-Chevallier, in their complete English version, translated this formulation as \"One is not born, but rather becomes, woman\" because in this context (one of many different usages of \"woman\" in the book), the word is used by Beauvoir to mean woman as a construct or an idea, rather than woman as an individual or one of a group. Butler writes that the book suggests that \"gender\" is an aspect of identity which is \"gradually acquired\". Butler sees The Second Sex as potentially providing a radical understanding of gender.Biographer Deirdre Bair, writing in her \"Introduction to the Vintage Edition\" in 1989, relates that \"one of the most sustained criticisms\" has been that Beauvoir is \"guilty of unconscious misogyny\", that she separated herself from women while writing about them. Bair writes that French writer Francis Jeanson and British poet Stevie Smith made similar criticisms: in Smith's words, \"She has written an enormous book about women and it is soon clear that she does not like them, nor does she like being a woman.\" Bair also quotes British scholar C. B. Radford's view that Beauvoir was \"guilty of painting women in her own colors\" because The Second Sex is \"primarily a middle-class document, so distorted by autobiographical influences that the individual problems of the writer herself may assume an exaggerated importance in her discussion of femininity.American theorist David M. Halperin criticizes Beauvoir's idealizing portrayal of sexual relations between women in The Second Sex. Critic Camille Paglia praised The Second Sex, calling it \"brilliant\" and \"the supreme work of modern feminism.\" Paglia writes that most modern feminists are merely \"repeating, amplifying or qualifying\" The Second Sex without realising their debt to it. In Free Women, Free Men (2017) Paglia writes that as a sixteen-year-old, she was \"stunned by de Beauvoir's imperious, authoritative tone and ambitious sweep through space and time\", which helped inspire her to write her work of literary criticism Sexual Personae (1990).", "hasanswer": false}]}

This is one function of stories that are told to children: to give them, at least, the basic understanding of attitudes and behaviors encountered in the real world. Through the story of the song, Clopin tells the children that it is a tale of \"a man and a monster\". Towards the end he gives them a riddle for them to guess whilst being told the rest of the story, that being: \"Who is the monster and who is the man?\", thus introducing the major theme of the film. What is meant by these words is to get behind what often are merely appearances, and by doing so we get to the actual truth. This aspect of the story can be related to real life because people often make the error of mistaking appearances (that also may be false) for the real thing or for something else entirely. In the beginning \"the picture explicitly compares the [otherness] of Quasimodo to the righteousness of Frollo\", playing on the stereotype that Quasimodo's deformities make him the monster, while his master Frollo is the man due to his sleeker looks. It is implied by the end of the film, however, that it is now indeed a paradox and reversal of the statement attributed to the two personalities, not by their physical appearances. Singing the reprise of the song, Clopin gives a girl a new riddle: \"What makes a monster and what makes a man?\", stating that Quasimodo is the man because of his humble kindness and selfless bravery, while Frollo is deemed to be the monster because of his selfishness, cruelty, and intolerance.\nThe work Mouse Morality: The Rhetoric of Disney Animated Film by Annalee R. Ward argues that the use of a play-within-a-play technique used in this opening number \"enables the filmmakers to condense some of the story, telling us the setting instead of showing it\".

Nemo, a nine-year-old boy, has been thrust into a position where he must make an impossible decision\u2014to choose between his mother and father. In the seconds preceding the rest of his life, he wonders where each choice will take him. The forces of the universe working to bring about total chaos are counteracted by this boy's overactive imagination. The dilemma that causes the film's main problem (not knowing the future), once solved, makes it all the more difficult: \"I don't know the future, therefore I cannot make a decision. Now that I know the future I still cannot make one.\" The eloquent interplay between philosophical lifestyle and what forges reality is epitomized by the way the film constantly jumps between scenes of the young boy, the adolescent, and the mature man. The film takes a four-dimensionalist view of the nature and existence of life in the universe, with each decision branching off to create an entirely separate alternate universe. Mr. Nobody raises many ontological arguments about the subjective nature of time and investigates how actions have universal consequences, and how every single choice, irrespective of its simplicity or complexity, can make, alter, or change a lifetime.The film also makes substantial use of chaos theory, string theory, and the butterfly effect to accentuate the lack of control that humans, as individuals, possess. There are numerous scenes, at each stage of his life, where Nemo is subject to the whims of chance, often plunging into water, a place where humans lack control, as a visual symbol of the powerlessness attributed to the human condition. The theories are used to compound reality in the film, a reality in which time always moves in one direction\u2014the smoke never goes back into the cigarette. Then, at the end, when it seems the universe is on the precipice of ultimate chaos, making use of the Big Crunch theory, time halts and begins to reverse. This brings the freedom from choice Nemo had been seeking, for, as Nemo says in the film, \"as long as you don't choose, everything remains possible.\" The tale of Nemo Nobody reflects a life of choices, whether or not we made the correct choices, and what would happen if we could go back and change them. In the end, Mr. Nobody, at age 118, states that it doesn't matter what we choose, because each choice, once made, has just as much significance as any alternate choice would have. The film portrays a life where we are all subject to chance, the dimensions by which we construct our reality (height, length, width, and time), and the imagination of our former selves, and, once the boy Nemo knows the outcome of a given choice, he instinctively opts for another.The different colors used in the film have symbolic meanings. Each of the three main storylines has its own unique hue that highlights its originality and unlikeness to the others. The color differentiation can be traced as far back as Nemo's childhood, where his possible future wives, Jean, Elise, and Anna, sit on a bench, wearing yellow, blue, and red dresses, respectively. In his life with Jean, Nemo seeks material well-being and independence, and yellow\u2014the color of life and wealth\u2014emphasizes this. Choosing Elise, Nemo experiences the consequences of depression and despair, which are themes associated with the color blue. Finally, the true love and passionate relationship between Nemo and Anna is symbolized by the red color of Anna's dress. It is also noteworthy that the unborn Nemo is shown living in a white world, as white contains all colors of the visible spectrum, which supports the allegorical message of the film that all things are possible until a choice is made. At the end of his life, Nemo is a decrepit old man and lives in a white surrounding (room, clothes, doctor), indicating that the fate of the protagonist leads him back to his origins\u2014the point at which everything is possible.The idea of a child learning about their whole life in the womb only to have an angel take the memory away is a reference to the Jewish concept of Lailah, the Angel of Conception, and it also bears a resemblance to the Myth of Er as found in the Republic.", "hasanswer": false}]}

In a 1986 interview, Moore said, \"What I'd like to explore is the areas that comics succeed in where no other media is capable of operating\", and emphasized this by stressing the differences between comics and film. Moore said that Watchmen was designed to be read \"four or five times\", with some links and allusions only becoming apparent to the reader after several readings. Dave Gibbons notes that, \"[a]s it progressed, Watchmen became much more about the telling than the tale itself. The main thrust of the story essentially hinges on what is called a macguffin, a gimmick ... So really the plot itself is of no great consequence ... it just really isn't the most interesting thing about Watchmen. As we actually came to tell the tale, that's where the real creativity came in.\"Gibbons said he deliberately constructed the visual look of Watchmen so that each page would be identifiable as part of that particular series and \"not some other comic book\". He made a concerted effort to draw the characters in a manner different from that commonly seen in comics. The artist tried to draw the series with \"a particular weight of line, using a hard, stiff pen that didn't have much modulation in terms of thick and thin\" which he hoped \"would differentiate it from the usual lush, fluid kind of comic book line\". In a 2009 interview, Moore recalled that he took advantage of Gibbons' training as a former surveyor for \"including incredible amounts of detail in every tiny panel, so we could choreograph every little thing\". Gibbons described the series as \"a comic about comics\". Gibbons felt that \"Alan is more concerned with the social implications of [the presence of super-heroes] and I've gotten involved in the technical implications.\" The story's alternate world setting allowed Gibbons to change details of the American landscape, such as adding electric cars, slightly different buildings, and spark hydrants instead of fire hydrants, which Moore said, \"perhaps gives the American readership a chance in some ways to see their own culture as an outsider would\". Gibbons noted that the setting was liberating for him because he did not have to rely primarily on reference books.Colorist John Higgins used a template that was \"moodier\" and favored secondary colors. Moore stated that he had also \"always loved John's coloring, but always associated him with being an airbrush colorist\", which Moore was not fond of; Higgins subsequently decided to color Watchmen in European-style flat color. Moore noted that the artist paid particular attention to lighting and subtle color changes; in issue six, Higgins began with \"warm and cheerful\" colors and throughout the issue gradually made it darker to give the story a dark and bleak feeling.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Meanwhile, archeologists Steve Banning (Dick Foran) and Babe Jenson (Wallace Ford) persuade magician Solvani (Cecil Kellaway) to finance an expedition in search of the tomb of Princess Ananka.

The film had what was described as a \"modest\" budget and reuses footage from The Mummy as well as reusing nearly the entire score from Son of Frankenstein. However, the film has no shared plot with the original film and is not considered a sequel or a remake.

Thompson later said that when the director showed up on the first day of shooting and looked at the script, Crabtree claimed it was not the film he had been hired to direct, as he did not do \"monster\" films. After a heated argument with the producers, Crabtree left the set and did not show up for several days. In the interim, Thompson himself directed the film.Fiend Without a Face was made entirely in England. Its Canadian setting was chosen because it would appeal to both American and British Commonwealth movie audiences, while still being easy to replicate using the English shooting locations. U. S. Air Force stock aviation footage was also used to establish the military base setting and to pad out the film's meager running time. The producers used primarily expatriate American and Canadian actors working in the United Kingdom, plus a few British actors dubbed by Americans.The film's visible brain creatures were created using stop-motion animation, an unusual practice for such a low-budget science fiction thriller of this era. The director of these effects sequences was Florenz Von Nordoff, while the actual stop-motion was done in Munich by Nordhoff's partner, German special effects artist K. L. Ruppel. Peter Neilson headed up the British practical effects crew.During July 1958, Fiend Without a Face first opened in the United States at the Rialto Theatre in New York City's Theater District. The film's producers placed an outdoor, front-of-the-house exhibit near the sidewalk that showcased a \"living and breathing Fiend\" in a steel-barred glass display case. It periodically moved its spinal cord tail, startling onlookers, and also made menacing sounds with the help of a concealed electrical device. The crowds that gathered to watch the caged Fiend grew so large that NYC police finally ordered the display case removed because it was creating a public disturbance.Five months later, Fiend Without a Face created a public uproar after its British premiere at the Ritz Theatre in Leicester Square in London's West End. The British Board of Film Censors had demanded a number of cuts before its release and finally granted the film an \"X\" certificate, but newspaper critics were still aghast at its horrifying special effects. Questions were actually raised in Parliament as to why British censors had allowed Fiend Without a Face to be released, notably: \"What is the British film industry thinking by trying to beat Hollywood at its own game of overdosing on blood and gore\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

She expresses her fear and distress toward ongoing racial mixing and uses biblical citations as divine justification for white supremacy.\nThe slave-holder, in many instances, was as much to be pitied as the slaves, but the Northerners could not see this. He (the slave-holder), too, was a victim of the system, often having inherited slaves along with his plantation. Where the slaves were well treated they were happy and contented, and their owners found consolation in this, using it as an argument in support of the institution. But some radicals could never see this side of the question. They dwelt continually on the cruelties of a few hard taskmasters and ignored the good people who had the welfare of their dependents at heart. It was hard for the Southerners to be reconciled to this spirit so widely manifested in the North. No matter what the better class of slave-owners might do, they had to bear the stigma and cruelty with the worst of tyrants. ...\nA strong attachment as a rule existed between the negro servants and their masters which could not be easily broken. When it came time to taking away a colored \"Mammy\" who had brought up the children of her white master, even nursing them at her own breast in an extremity, here was more involved than a Northerner could readily comprehend. This aspect of slavery was never taken into serious consideration by hot-headed Abolitionists who tried to foment war and bring about disunion. ...\nWhite supremacy is an issue of great importance. If some of the colored people are not curbed in their ambition to mix their blood with that of the white race, it will not be long until there will be no such thing as definite racial lines. The Negroes are going north and settling indiscriminately among the whites. Property values are being depreciated by this influx of colored immigration. But little sympathy was shown the South when a race of colored slaves was liberated among them. The North had no conception of what it meant for the white people of the South to preserve the color and racial lines, considering the fact that in some places the population was about equally divided, and there was no cooperation from the North to be had in the struggle. ...\n\nThe Book of Genesis, in its account of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, sons of Noah, teaches the supremacy of the white race.  Ham saw the nakedness of his father, but made no effort to cover him, and a curse was pronounced upon him and his posterity. Noah awoke from his wine and said, \"Cursed be Canaan [Ham]; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.\" \"Blessed be the Lord of God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.\" \"God shall enlarge Japheth [the white race], and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant\" (Gen. 9:25-27). This edict was imposed by a wise and just God, and should not work a hardship on the black race. It cannot be otherwise than it should be for their good. Until the curse is lifted from the human race, the very best position that the sons of Ham could be placed in is that of servants (not slaves), thus establishing white supremacy as foretold more than four thousand years ago. ...", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "462_176", "question": "What is the color of The Leech Woman?", "ctxs": [{"id": "462_63727", "text": "The Leech Woman got mixed reviews upon release. According to BoxOffice magazine's standing feature \"Review Digest\", which summarized the rankings of films by a standard set of publications, the film was called \"very good\" by Harrison's Reports; \"good\" by Film Daily and BoxOffice itself; \"fair\" by The Hollywood Reporter and Parents' Magazine, and \"poor\" by the New York Daily News and Variety. BoxOffice also compiled figures for its \"Boxoffice Barometer', a percentage scale on which 100 equaled \"normal\" box office receipts. The Leech Woman had an average score of 101. Eight theaters in cities around the US reported their percentages: Minneapolis, 140; Buffalo, Detroit, Indianapolis and San Francisco, 100 each; New Haven, 95; Boston, 90; and Omaha, 85.\nThe BoxOffice review says relatively little that is specific to the film itself, starting instead with the statement \"Dracula's various femme relatives, 'The Wasp Woman' [1959] and all the other gory gals of the screen, must move over and make room in their hall of infamy for this newcomer to the rank of distaff side chill dispensers\". But the anonymous review goes on favorably to call the film \"a solidly produced, ably acted spine-tingler\" and describes Dein as a \"business-like\" director and Gershenson a \"budget-stretching\" producer who \"combine[d] to elevate the offering several cuts above the norm\".Warren, however, quotes two contemporary reviews that thought little of The Leech Woman. The pseudonymous \"Tube,\" writing in Variety, called the film a \"lower-berth item\" with a \"tendency to meander into lengthy, irrelevant passages\", while The Monthly Film Bulletin used the phrase \"dull horror film\" to describe it. Warren himself finds the film to be not very well made, saying that it has a \"perfunctory get-it-over-with air\" and is saddled with a poor structure as \"More than half the film is spent simply setting up the rejuvention gimmick; June's life as a leech woman occupies a very small part of the film\". Nonetheless, he praises Gray's performance as \"the film's greatest strength\" and \"one of the few really memorable performances of her career\". But he writes that \"Gloria Talbott can't work up much energy\" in her role and that Williams was \"a hapless contract player (...) who had no choice about appearing in certain films\". Warren also says that \"no characters are likable, so we spend our time with unpleasant bores\".British horror and science fiction scholar Phil Hardy puts The Leech Woman into the category of \"one of several low-budget rejuvenation films of the early sixties\", but compliments \"Bud Westmore's striking makeup\" as \"the most notable feature of this workmanlike offering, the last to be directed by Dein, a Poverty Row regular\". Senn, on the other hand, says that Gray is \"let down by Bud Westmore's makeup department in her early scenes where her face looks like it needs rejuvenation less than just a good scrubbing\". But Senn, too, writes that Gray's \"performance as the female Mr. Hyde stands out\" in a film that is otherwise a \"juvenile but well-acted chiller that came at the tail end of Universal's string of 1950s sci-fi/horror melodramas\".In a synopsis, Eleanor Mannikka of AllMovie describes The Leech Woman as \"An uninspired horror film\" with a \"ragged story [that] begins in darkest Africa and in the even darker psyche of a mentally deteriorating woman\".In looking at race in the film, the anonymous reviewer at Blackhorrormovies calls it a \"parade of clich\u00e9s and stereotypes\" and points out that its \"portrayal of Africa is pretty typical of Hollywood in this era (and to some extent, up to the turn of the [21st] century)\" with its \"mystical rites with wildly gyrating natives\", its \"references to indigenous tribes as 'savages'\" and its \"'good' locals escorting the outsiders who either die or flee in terror (in this case, both)\". But \"the Malla character is an intelligent, well-spoken, classy lady - the type of black person not often seen in horror films of this era\". The reviewer also points out that Malla 'has a heart of gold compared to the Caucasian characters in the film, who are all despicable human beings\".Other critics, such as Bruce F. Kawin, bring up the roles that sexual identity and aging play in the film. Kawin writes that June's failed attempt to use Sally's pineal gland secretions is her undoing as the transformation ritual demands male secretions. \"The Leech Woman rejects a lesbian solution to June's problem (there is no radical feminist movement yet), which in context is presented as unnatural - that is, as another unnatural solution when what is needed is submission to nature, letting oneself age and die\".Aging is the specific focus of critic Dawn Keetley. To her, the film \"gets not only at what aging feels like for everyone, but, specifically, at what it feels like for a woman in a society that continues to value youth and beauty\" as June is forced to face the \"sudden horrific onset on aging\" over and again. Worse, when June \"reverts\" from being youthful to middle-aged, she experiences becoming \"older and older each time\".Likewise, aging (and sexism) is the topic of film scholar Vivian Sobchack. She writes, \"It is now a commonplace to acknowledge the complexity of ageism and sexism in white heterosexual culture in the United States\". Taking The Leech Woman as her text, and the relationship of June and Paul in particular, Sobchack notes that \"in a sexist as well as ageist technoculture, the visibly aging body of a woman has been and still is especially terrifying - not only to the woman who experiences self-revulsion and anger, invisibility and abandonment, but also to the men who find her presence so unbearable they must - quite literally - disavow and divorce her\". Sobchack further points out the additional complexity of the \"double standard\" of the aging man and woman, naming it as a \"standard that elicits a complex of engendered emotions from both the women and the men who bear it: fear, humiliation, abjection, shame, power, rage, and guilt\".", "hasanswer": false}]}

It was released in the United States by American International Pictures during the fall of 1963 as the bottom half of a double feature with Corman's X: The Man with the X-ray Eyes.\nAlthough Coppola had been involved in at least two sexploitation films previously, Dementia 13 served as his first mainstream \"legitimate\" directorial effort. Corman offered Coppola the chance to direct a low-budget horror film in Ireland using funds left over from Corman's recently completed The Young Racers, on which Coppola had worked as a sound technician. The producer wanted a cheap Psycho copy, complete with gothic atmosphere and brutal killings, and Coppola quickly wrote a screenplay with Corman's requirements. Although he was given total directorial freedom during production, Coppola found himself at odds with Corman after the film was completed. The producer declared it unreleasable and demanded several changes be made.\nIn 2017, Coppola's company, American Zoetrope, restored the film's director's cut under the supervision of James T.

In 1998, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader included the film in his unranked list of the best American films not included on the AFI Top 100.

{"id": "462_183", "question": "What is the color of The Lion Has Wings?", "ctxs": [{"id": "641_16171", "text": "The choice of an eagle as the team mascot honored the insignia of the New Deal program, the National Recovery Administration, which featured a blue eagle as its insignia.For the 1933 and 1934 seasons, the Eagles colors were light blue and yellow. In 1935, they added green to their uniforms and for several decades, their colors were kelly green, silver, and white. In 1954 the Eagles, along with the Baltimore Colts, became the second team ever in the NFL to put a logo on their helmets, with silver wings on a kelly green helmet. In 1969 the team wore two helmet versions: Kelly green with white wings in road games, and white with kelly green wings at home. From 1970 to '73, they wore the white helmets with Kelly green wings exclusively before switching back to Kelly green helmets with silver wings. By 1974, Joseph A. Scirrotto Jr. designed the silver wings within a white outline, and this style on a kelly green helmet became standard for over two decades.\nFrom 1948 to 1995, the team logo was an eagle in flight carrying a football in its claws, although from 1969 to 1972, the eagle took on a more stylized look.\nIn 1973, the team's name was added below the eagle, returning to its pre-1969 look. Both the logo and uniforms were radically altered in 1996, when the primary kelly green color was changed to a darker shade, officially described as \"midnight green.\" Silver was practically abandoned, as uniform pants moved to either white or midnight green. The traditional helmet wings were changed to a primarily white color, with silver and black accents. The team's logo combination (the eagle and club name lettering) also changed, with the eagle itself limited to a white (bald eagle) head, drawn in a less realistic, more cartoon-like style, and the lettering changed from calligraphic to block letters. The eagle head is the only NFL logo to \u201cface left\u201d which causes the right side of the logo to present a stylized \u201cE\u201d.\nSince 1996, the team has made only minor alterations, mostly related to jersey/pants combinations worn during specific games. For example, in 1997, against the San Francisco 49ers, the team wore midnight green jerseys and pants for the first of only two occasions in team history. The second occasion was in 2002, during the final regular season game at Veterans Stadium, a win over the division-rival Washington Redskins. A year later, in the first two games of the 2003 season (both home losses, to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New England Patriots), the Eagles wore white jerseys with white pants. After that, the white jerseys along with white pants were worn exclusively during preseason games from 2004 to 2011, with the exception of 2007 and 2010.\nThe 2003 season also saw the first (though subtle) change to the 1996-style uniform. On both white and green jerseys, black shadows and silver trim were added to both the green and white numbering. The stripe on the pants changed from black-green-black to black-silver-green on the white pants, and from a solid black stripe to one stripe of black, another of silver, with one small white stripe in between for the midnight green pants. The 2003 season also saw the team debut black alternate jerseys, with a green (instead of black) shadow on white numbers, and silver trim. These black jerseys have been worn for two selected home games each season (usually the first home game after a bye week and the season finale). In the 2003 and 2004 regular-season home finales, the team wore the green road pants with the black alternate jerseys, but lost both games. Since then, the Eagles have only worn the black jerseys with the white pants. However, due to the special 75th-anniversary uniforms serving as the \"alternates\" for one game in 2007, the Eagles could not wear the alternate black jersey that season per league rules at the time (alternate uniforms were permitted twice per season but only one can be used). The black jerseys with white pants, however, re-appeared for the 2008 Thanksgiving night game against the Arizona Cardinals. From 2006 to 2013, the Eagles have only worn the alternate black jerseys once a season and for the last November home game, but did not use them in 2007, 2010, and 2011. For the 2007 and 2010 seasons, the Eagles used throwback uniforms in place of the black alternates for their anniversary to commemorate past teams. The team also started wearing black cleats exclusively in 2004, although the rule was relaxed by the mid-2010s.\nTo celebrate the team's 75th anniversary, the 2007 uniforms featured a 75th-season logo patch on the left shoulder. In addition, the team wore \"throwback\" jerseys in a 2007 game against the Detroit Lions. The yellow and blue jerseys, the same colors found on Philadelphia's city flag, are based on those worn by the Philadelphia Eagles in the team's inaugural season, and had been the same colors used by the Frankford Yellow Jackets franchise prior to its suspension of operations in 1931. The Eagles beat Detroit, 56\u201321.The Eagles wear their white jerseys at home for preseason games and daytime games in the first half of the regular season from September to mid-October when the temperature is warmer. In night contests in the first half of the regular season, the Eagles do not need to wear white at home since the temperature is cooler. However, there have been exceptions, such as the home opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2003 and the Washington Redskins in 2007 that were played at night. In late October or beginning in November, the Eagles start to wear their colors at home (although they had done it earlier), be it the midnight green jerseys or a third jersey. On one occasion, the Eagles wore white at home after October in a meeting against the Dallas Cowboys on November 4, 2007, in order to make the Cowboys wear their blue road jerseys. Upon moving to Lincoln Financial Field in 2003, the Eagles wore white at home for at least their home opener, but in recent years they opted to wear their standard midnight green jerseys even during the warmest of autumn weather.\nIn the 2010 season against the Green Bay Packers, on September 12, 2010, the Eagles wore uniforms similar to the ones that were worn by the 1960 championship team in honor the 50th anniversary of that team. In weeks 4 and 6 of the 2010 season, the Eagles wore their white jerseys in a match-up against the Washington Redskins and Atlanta Falcons, respectively, before reverting to their midnight green jerseys for the rest of their home games.\nFor the 2012 season, Nike took over from Reebok as the NFL's official apparel licensee, but the Eagles decided that they would not be adopting Nike's \"Elite 51\" uniform technology. Aside from the Nike logo replacing the Reebok logo, the only other change is the league-wide revision of the NFL shield on the uniform (replacing the NFL Equipment logo). Other than that the uniforms essentially remain unchanged. The Eagles also revived their black alternate jersey and resumed wearing white pants with their white jerseys in the regular season.\nFor the 2014 season, the Eagles officially adopted the \"Elite 51\u2033 style uniform from Nike. However, they only broke out the midnight green jerseys and pants in the second half of that season due to the difficulty of producing their preferred shade of midnight green.\nRecently the team has discussed bringing back the \"Kelly Green\" uniforms similar to the uniforms worn in the 1960 NFL Championship season, which were last worn in the 2010 season opener vs. Green Bay. Traditionally, kelly green, silver and white had been the official team colors, until the 1996 season when it changed to the current \"Midnight Green\" uniforms. NFL rules and restrictions require that teams go through a waiting period before any major uniform changes and alterations can be made, which means it would likely be quite some time before any uniform changes are officially made.\nIn Week 6 of 2014 against the New York Giants, the team introduced black pants to complement their black jerseys, giving them a blackout uniform set. The Eagles won the game 27\u20130. The victory was their first shutout in 18 years. In Week 16 of 2016 (also against the Giants), the Eagles wore a variation of the all-black look as part of the NFL Color Rush program, but with solid black socks as opposed to black with white sanitary socks of the original look. The black jerseys/white pants combination was last seen during a preseason road game against the New England Patriots, after which the black jerseys were paired exclusively with the black pants.\nIn 2018, the Eagles' midnight green pants were not worn at all, marking the first such instance since the 1996 rebrand that the Eagles wore only white pants with their primary white or midnight green jerseys.\nIn Week 6 of the 2017 season, the Eagles debuted an all-white look with white jerseys, white pants and solid white socks in a road game against the Carolina Panthers. The all-white look began to be utilized full-time as a road uniform set in 2019 thanks to the NFL's decision to allow teams to wear solid color socks as an alternate look.\nDuring Week 10 of the 2021 season, the Eagles paired their white uniforms with the alternate black pants against the Denver Broncos, marking the first time the black pants were paired with a different colored uniform.\nIn 2022, the Eagles unveiled a new black alternate helmet, which would be worn alongside the all-black uniform. In addition, the team announced that throwback Kelly Green uniforms would return as an alternate uniform starting in the 2023 season. The team originally intended to release the uniforms in 2022, but due to production supply issues, the Eagles elected to delay its release to 2023. With the Kelly Green helmet becoming the team's alternate, the black helmet was shelved, and the Eagles returned to wearing their primary midnight green helmets with the all-black uniform.\nOn June 16, it was released to the media that the Eagles would be changing their wordmark to a more modernized design. The new wordmark would replace the old design immediately however would not be placed on the Team's Jerseys until the 2024 season.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Many of these are found in the Sierra Mixteca region. However, the state is best known for cemitas, mole poblano, chiles en nogada and chalupas.\nThe cemita is a kind of sandwich on a roll, related to the torta, particularly popular in Mexico City and the pambazo, which is of French origin and popular in several areas in central Mexico. The sandwich has its origin with two kinds of bread which were brought over from Spain during the colonial period: one called \"bizcocho de sal\", which was long and hard and a kind of hollow cracker. Both breads were developed for long storage and eventually were made in Puebla with grain from the Atlixco area. These two breads eventually fused into a unique type that became softer by the mid 19th century. The name is derived from a Jewish unleavened bread called \"semita\", which was brought over by Sephardi Jews to New Spain. These were also produced in Puebla state. The cemitas were prepared at home and filled with potatoes, beans and nopal cactus and eaten by the lower classes. Later, an establishment in the Mercado Victoria market began to sell them to the public filled with meat from bull's feet with a vinaigrette, herbs, onions and chili peppers. This new filling was a hit and eventually this and other variations became a staple in many markets and popular eateries. Today, a large number varieties exist but all are prepared using the same type of bread.\nThe best-known mole is named after the city of Puebla, mole poblano. The origin of this sauce is disputed and there are two versions of the legend that are most often cited. The first states that 16th century nuns from the Convent of Santa Rosa were worried because they had just found out that the archbishop was going to visit them and they had nothing to prepare for him except for an old turkey in the yard. Supposedly due to divine inspiration, they began to mix together many of the spices and flavorings they had on hand in the kitchen, including different types of chili peppers, other spices, day-old bread, chocolate and approximately twenty other ingredients. They let the sauce simmer for hours and poured it over the turkey meat. Fortunately, the archbishop was very pleased with the meal and the nuns were able to save face.The other story states that the sauce is of pre-Hispanic times and this was served to Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and the other conquistadors by Moctezuma II. The Aztecs did have a preparation called \"chilmulli\", which in Nahuatl means \"chili pepper sauce\". However, there is no evidence that chocolate was ever used to flavor prepared foods or used in chilmulli. What has happened is that the sauce gained ingredients as it was reinterpreted over the colonial period.Many food writers and gourmets nowadays consider one particular dish, the famous turkey in mole poblano, which contains chocolate, to represent the pinnacle of the Mexican cooking tradition.\nAccording to the legend of chiles en nogada, there were three sisters from the city of Puebla who were in Mexico City. When the Army of the Three Guarantees entered the capital at the end of the Mexican War of Independence, they were feted by many. At one of these parties, the three sisters fell in love with three of the army's officers. Soon after, Agust\u00edn de Iturbide himself was set to visit the city of Puebla. Remembering the sisters, the soon-to-be emperor wanted to visit them. Wanting to impress Iturbide but not knowing how to cook, the sisters turned to the nuns of the Santa Monica convent who were famous for their food. The nuns decided to invent a dish for the sisters, which would represent the three colors of the new Mexican flag. On the appointed day, the banquet was prepared with the dish now called chiles en nogada, which pleased Iturbide. The dish contains poblano chile, walnuts, cream and pomegranate seeds, and offered seasonally (August\u2013September) in local restaurants.\nChalupas are thick corn tortillas fried in lard then covered in red or green chili pepper sauce and topped with shredded meat and other things. According to legend, they were named after the barges that the Aztecs used to travel in areas such as Tenochtitlan (today Mexico City). Chalupas are popular in other areas of central Mexico but are considered a specialty of Puebla, where they are served from humble street carts to upscale restaurants.", "hasanswer": false}]}

She expresses her fear and distress toward ongoing racial mixing and uses biblical citations as divine justification for white supremacy.\nThe slave-holder, in many instances, was as much to be pitied as the slaves, but the Northerners could not see this. He (the slave-holder), too, was a victim of the system, often having inherited slaves along with his plantation. Where the slaves were well treated they were happy and contented, and their owners found consolation in this, using it as an argument in support of the institution. But some radicals could never see this side of the question. They dwelt continually on the cruelties of a few hard taskmasters and ignored the good people who had the welfare of their dependents at heart. It was hard for the Southerners to be reconciled to this spirit so widely manifested in the North. No matter what the better class of slave-owners might do, they had to bear the stigma and cruelty with the worst of tyrants. ...\nA strong attachment as a rule existed between the negro servants and their masters which could not be easily broken. When it came time to taking away a colored \"Mammy\" who had brought up the children of her white master, even nursing them at her own breast in an extremity, here was more involved than a Northerner could readily comprehend. This aspect of slavery was never taken into serious consideration by hot-headed Abolitionists who tried to foment war and bring about disunion. ...\nWhite supremacy is an issue of great importance. If some of the colored people are not curbed in their ambition to mix their blood with that of the white race, it will not be long until there will be no such thing as definite racial lines. The Negroes are going north and settling indiscriminately among the whites. Property values are being depreciated by this influx of colored immigration. But little sympathy was shown the South when a race of colored slaves was liberated among them. The North had no conception of what it meant for the white people of the South to preserve the color and racial lines, considering the fact that in some places the population was about equally divided, and there was no cooperation from the North to be had in the struggle. ...\n\nThe Book of Genesis, in its account of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, sons of Noah, teaches the supremacy of the white race.  Ham saw the nakedness of his father, but made no effort to cover him, and a curse was pronounced upon him and his posterity. Noah awoke from his wine and said, \"Cursed be Canaan [Ham]; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.\" \"Blessed be the Lord of God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.\" \"God shall enlarge Japheth [the white race], and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant\" (Gen. 9:25-27). This edict was imposed by a wise and just God, and should not work a hardship on the black race. It cannot be otherwise than it should be for their good. Until the curse is lifted from the human race, the very best position that the sons of Ham could be placed in is that of servants (not slaves), thus establishing white supremacy as foretold more than four thousand years ago. ...", "hasanswer": false}]}

During pre-production, test shots in color and 3D were made. A few color tests of the large-scale ant models were also made, but when it was time to shoot the 3D test, Warner Bros.' \"All Media\" 3D camera rig malfunctioned and no footage could be filmed. The next day a memo was sent out that the color and 3D aspects of the production were to be scrapped; widescreen black-and-white would now be the film's presentation format. Warner Bros. hoped to emulate the \"effective shock treatment\" effect of its previous science fiction thriller The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms; ultimately, however, the film was never made in widescreen. Because of the preparation of certain scenes, many of the camera set-ups for 3D remain in the film, like the opening titles and the flamethrowers shots aimed directly at the camera.Although Warner Bros. was dissatisfied with the color results, the film's titles were printed in vivid red and blue against a black-and-white background to give the film's opening a dramatic \"punch\". This effect was achieved by an Eastman Color section spliced into each release print. The 1985 VHS tape release, the subsequent LaserDisc and later DVD release have retained this black-and-white-with-two-color title effect.The entrance to the ants' final nest was filmed along the concrete spillways of the Los Angeles River, between the First and Seventh Street Bridges, east of downtown. The depiction of the Chihuahuan Desert of southern New Mexico is actually the Mojave Desert near Palmdale, California. Mercy Hospital was a real institution and is now Brownsville Medical Center.James Whitmore wore \"lifts\" in his shoes to compensate for the height difference between himself and James Arness. Whitmore also employed bits of \"business\" (hand gestures and motions) during scenes in which he appeared to draw more attention to his character when not speaking.The Wilhelm scream, created three years earlier for the film Distant Drums, is used during the action sequences: when a sailor aboard the freighter is grabbed by an ant, when James Whitmore's character is caught in an ant's mandibles, and when an overhead wooden beam falls on a soldier in the Los Angeles storm drain sequence.The giant ants, painted a purplish-green color, were constructed and operated by unseen technicians supervised by Ralph Ayers. During the climactic battle sequence in the Los Angeles sewers, there is a brief shot of one ant moving in the foreground with its side removed, revealing its mechanical interior. This filming error was obscured on the DVD and Blu-ray releases of the film.The film poster shows a gigantic ant with menacing cat-like eyes rather than the normal compound eyes of an ant.\nThe stridulations (the sounds the giant ants emit on the soundtrack) were the calls of bird-voiced tree frogs mixed together with the calls of a wood thrush, hooded warbler, and red-bellied woodpecker.

One origin story tells how Muhammad chose his foundation mares by a test of their courage and loyalty. While there are several variants on the tale, a common version states that after a long journey through the desert, Muhammad turned his herd of horses loose to race to an oasis for a desperately needed drink of water. Before the herd reached the water, Muhammad called for the horses to return to him. Only five mares responded. Because they faithfully returned to their master, though desperate with thirst, these mares became his favorites and were called Al Khamsa, meaning, the five. These mares became the legendary founders of the five \"strains\" of the Arabian horse. Although the Al Khamsa are generally considered fictional horses of legend, some breeders today claim the modern Bedouin Arabian actually descended from these mares.Another origin tale claims that King Solomon was given a pure Arabian-type mare named Safanad (\"the pure\") by the Queen of Sheba. A different version says that Solomon gave a stallion, Zad el-Raheb or Zad-el-Rakib (\"Gift to the Rider\"), to the Banu Azd people when they came to pay tribute to the king. This legendary stallion was said to be faster than the zebra and the gazelle, and every hunt with him was successful, thus when he was put to stud, he became a founding sire of legend.Yet another creation myth puts the origin of the Arabian in the time of Ishmael, the son of Abraham. In this story, the Angel Jibril (also known as Gabriel) descended from Heaven and awakened Ishmael with a \"wind-spout\" that whirled toward him. The Angel then commanded the thundercloud to stop scattering dust and rain, and so it gathered itself into a prancing, handsome creature - a horse - that seemed to swallow up the ground.

To thy forelock, I bind Victory in battle. On thy back, I set a rich spoil and a Treasure in thy loins. I establish thee as one of the Glories of the Earth... I give thee flight without wings.\" Other versions of the story claim Allah said to the South Wind: \"I want to make a creature out of you. Condense.\" Then from the material condensed from the wind, he made a kamayt-colored animal (a bay or burnt chestnut) and said: \"I call you Horse; I make you Arabian and I give you the chestnut color of the ant; I have hung happiness from the forelock which hangs between your eyes; you shall be the Lord of the other animals.

From September through December 1902, a hand-colored print of A Trip to the Moon was screened at M\u00e9li\u00e8s's Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Robert-Houdin in Paris. The film was shown after Saturday and Thursday matinee performances by M\u00e9li\u00e8s's colleague and fellow magician, Jules-Eug\u00e8ne Legris, who appeared as the leader of the parade in the two final scenes. M\u00e9li\u00e8s sold black-and-white and color prints of the film through his Star Film Company, where the film was assigned the catalogue number 399\u2013411 and given the descriptive subtitle Pi\u00e8ce \u00e0 grand spectacle en 30 tableaux. In France, black-and-white prints sold for \u20a3560, and hand-colored prints for \u20a31,000. M\u00e9li\u00e8s also sold the film indirectly through Charles Urban's Warwick Trading Company in London.Many circumstances surrounding the film\u2014including its unusual budget, length, and production time, as well as its similarities to the 1901 New York attraction\u2014indicate that M\u00e9li\u00e8s was especially keen to release the film in the United States. Because of rampant film piracy, M\u00e9li\u00e8s never received most of the profits of the popular film. One account reports that M\u00e9li\u00e8s sold a print of the film to the Paris photographer Charles Gerschel for use in an Algiers theatre, under strict stipulation that the print only be shown in Algeria. Gerschel sold the print, and various other M\u00e9li\u00e8s films, to the Edison Manufacturing Company employee Alfred C. Abadie, who sent them directly to Edison's laboratories to be duplicated and sold by Vitagraph. Copies of the print spread to other firms, and by 1904 Siegmund Lubin, the Selig Polyscope Company, and Edison were all redistributing it. Edison's print of the film was even offered in a hand-colored version available at a higher price, just as M\u00e9li\u00e8s had done. M\u00e9li\u00e8s was often uncredited altogether; for the first six months of the film's distribution, the only American exhibitor to credit M\u00e9li\u00e8s in advertisements for the film was Thomas Lincoln Tally, who chose the film as the inaugural presentation of his Electric Theater.In order to combat the problem of film piracy that became clear during the release of A Trip to the Moon, M\u00e9li\u00e8s opened an American branch of the Star Film Company, directed by his brother Gaston M\u00e9li\u00e8s, in New York in 1903. The office was designed to sell M\u00e9li\u00e8s's films directly and to protect them by registering them under United States copyright. The introduction to the English-language edition of the Star Film Company catalogue announced: \"In opening a factory and office in New York we are prepared and determined energetically to pursue all counterfeiters and pirates. We will not speak twice, we will act!\"Various trade arrangements were made with other film companies, including American Mutoscope and Biograph, the Warwick Trading Company, the Charles Urban Trading Co., Robert W. Paul's studio, and Gaumont. In these negotiations, a print sale price of US$0.15 per foot was standardised across the American market, which proved useful to M\u00e9li\u00e8s. Later price standardisations by the Motion Picture Patents Company in 1908 hastened his financial ruin, as his films were impractically expensive under the new standards. After 1908, his films waned from the fashions of time as fanciful magic fell out of vogue.", "hasanswer": false}]}

Generally, the genus has 64 subordinate taxa, three of which are well-known and are ostensibly named for the fruit color of the best-known cultivar: white, red, and black mulberry (Morus alba, M. rubra, and M. nigra, respectively), with numerous cultivars and some taxa currently unchecked and awaiting taxonomic scrutiny. M. alba is native to South Asia, but is widely distributed across Europe, Southern Africa, South America, and North America. M. alba is also the species most preferred by the silkworm, and is regarded as an invasive species in Brazil and the United States.The closely related genus Broussonetia is also commonly known as mulberry, notably the paper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera).Despite their similar appearance, mulberries are not closely related to raspberries or blackberries. All three species belong to the Rosales order.

Not allowed within 100 feet of the strip mall for at least a year, Jay and Silent Bob visit Brodie Bruce at his comic shop where they learn that Miramax Films is adapting Bluntman and Chronic, the comic book based on their likenesses. \nThe pair visit Holden McNeil, co-creator and co-writer of Bluntman and Chronic, and demand that he give them their royalty money from the film, but Holden explains he sold his half of the rights to co-creator and artist Banky Edwards. Seeing the film's negative reception online, the pair set out for Hollywood to prevent the film from ruining their image, or at least to receive the royalties owed to them.\nEn route, they befriend an animal liberation group: Justice, Sissy, Missy, Chrissy, and Brent. The organization is a front; Brent is a patsy, who will free animals from a laboratory as a diversion while the girls rob a diamond depository. Jay throws Brent out of their van to get closer to Justice, to whom he is attracted to. Justice is fond of the pair, but reluctantly accepts them as new patsies. While the girls steal the diamonds, Jay and Silent Bob free the animals, stealing an orangutan named Suzanne. They escape as the police arrive and the van explodes, believing the girls have perished.\nFederal Wildlife Marshal Willenholly (whose name is taken from Land of the Lost characters [1]) arrives at the crime scene; oblivious to the diamond heist, he claims jurisdiction due to the escaped animals, all of which have been recovered but Suzanne. The police find footage of a video Sissy made of Jay claiming to be \"the clit commander\", with \"Clit\" edited to be an acronym for Coalition for the Liberation of Itinerant Tree-Dwellers. Willenholly declares the crime an act of terrorism and calls for backup to hunt \"the two most dangerous men on the planet.\" He finds Jay and Silent Bob at a diner near Vasquez Rocks, and chases them into the sewer system of a nearby dam. Suzanne helps the duo in losing Willenholly by luring him off the dam, but is subsequently abducted by a Hollywood animal acting agency. \nThe duo then hitch a ride and arrive in Hollywood, and eventually, the Miramax lot. Chased by a team of security guards through the lot and several movie sets, including Good Will Hunting 2: Hunting Season, and reclaiming Suzanne from the set of Scream 4, Jay and Silent Bob end up in the dressing room of Jason Biggs and James Van Der Beek, the actors playing Bluntman and Chronic respectively in the film. Suzanne beats up the actors, knocking them out, and Jay and Silent Bob assume the roles while Van Der Beek and Biggs are arrested after getting mistaken for the duo.\nMeeting the film's antiwhite director Chaka Luther King, who mistakes them for Biggs and Van Der Beek's stunt doubles, Jay and Silent Bob are then escorted onto the set and forced to fight Mark Hamill, playing the supervillain of the film Cocknocker (a combination of Hamill's roles as The Joker, The Trickster, and Luke Skywalker) in a Star Wars-esque battle. Willenholly, armed with a shotgun, arrives to capture the pair, but Justice protects them, admitting the CLIT organization was only a diversion. The other thieves arrive and a climactic gun fight ensues. Jay and Silent Bob locate Banky and demand that he shut down production of the movie. Banky refuses on account of both the large sum of money Miramax offered him for the film and that the internet will continue to troll them regardless. Silent Bob then informs Banky that he violated their original likeness rights contract by selling the film rights of Bluntman and Chronic to Miramax without their permission, and therefore could face legal trouble if he doesn't give them their legally entitled royalties. Banky finally relents and agrees to give the duo half of his payment for the film.\nJustice then turns herself and her former team in to Willenholly in exchange for a shorter sentence and dropping the charges on Jay and Silent Bob. The duo spend their royalty money locating everyone who mocked them, their characters, and the movie on the internet, including children and members of the clergy, and travel to assault them. The scene cuts to the El Rey theater where a bunch of people exit, including Dante, Randal, Banky, Steve-Dave Pulski, Walt \"The Fanboy\" Grover, Willam Black, Hooper LaMonte, and sisters Alyssa and Tricia Jones, having just watched the Bluntman and Chronic movie, to poor reception. Jay and Silent Bob, accompanied by Justice and Willenholly (now an FBI agent), go across the street to enjoy the after party, featuring a performance from Morris Day and The Time.\nAfter the credits, God (Dogma) closes the View Askewniverse book.[2]", "hasanswer": false}]}

{"id": "462_205", "question": "What is the color of Mr. No Problem?", "ctxs": [{"id": "57_33803", "text": "Mr. Nobody can be seen as a tale about choice. Nemo, a nine-year-old boy, has been thrust into a position where he must make an impossible decision\u2014to choose between his mother and father. In the seconds preceding the rest of his life, he wonders where each choice will take him. The forces of the universe working to bring about total chaos are counteracted by this boy's overactive imagination. The dilemma that causes the film's main problem (not knowing the future), once solved, makes it all the more difficult: \"I don't know the future, therefore I cannot make a decision. Now that I know the future I still cannot make one.\" The eloquent interplay between philosophical lifestyle and what forges reality is epitomized by the way the film constantly jumps between scenes of the young boy, the adolescent, and the mature man. The film takes a four-dimensionalist view of the nature and existence of life in the universe, with each decision branching off to create an entirely separate alternate universe. Mr. Nobody raises many ontological arguments about the subjective nature of time and investigates how actions have universal consequences, and how every single choice, irrespective of its simplicity or complexity, can make, alter, or change a lifetime.The film also makes substantial use of chaos theory, string theory, and the butterfly effect to accentuate the lack of control that humans, as individuals, possess. There are numerous scenes, at each stage of his life, where Nemo is subject to the whims of chance, often plunging into water, a place where humans lack control, as a visual symbol of the powerlessness attributed to the human condition. The theories are used to compound reality in the film, a reality in which time always moves in one direction\u2014the smoke never goes back into the cigarette. Then, at the end, when it seems the universe is on the precipice of ultimate chaos, making use of the Big Crunch theory, time halts and begins to reverse. This brings the freedom from choice Nemo had been seeking, for, as Nemo says in the film, \"as long as you don't choose, everything remains possible.\" The tale of Nemo Nobody reflects a life of choices, whether or not we made the correct choices, and what would happen if we could go back and change them. In the end, Mr. Nobody, at age 118, states that it doesn't matter what we choose, because each choice, once made, has just as much significance as any alternate choice would have. The film portrays a life where we are all subject to chance, the dimensions by which we construct our reality (height, length, width, and time), and the imagination of our former selves, and, once the boy Nemo knows the outcome of a given choice, he instinctively opts for another.The different colors used in the film have symbolic meanings. Each of the three main storylines has its own unique hue that highlights its originality and unlikeness to the others. The color differentiation can be traced as far back as Nemo's childhood, where his possible future wives, Jean, Elise, and Anna, sit on a bench, wearing yellow, blue, and red dresses, respectively. In his life with Jean, Nemo seeks material well-being and independence, and yellow\u2014the color of life and wealth\u2014emphasizes this. Choosing Elise, Nemo experiences the consequences of depression and despair, which are themes associated with the color blue. Finally, the true love and passionate relationship between Nemo and Anna is symbolized by the red color of Anna's dress. It is also noteworthy that the unborn Nemo is shown living in a white world, as white contains all colors of the visible spectrum, which supports the allegorical message of the film that all things are possible until a choice is made. At the end of his life, Nemo is a decrepit old man and lives in a white surrounding (room, clothes, doctor), indicating that the fate of the protagonist leads him back to his origins\u2014the point at which everything is possible.The idea of a child learning about their whole life in the womb only to have an angel take the memory away is a reference to the Jewish concept of Lailah, the Angel of Conception, and it also bears a resemblance to the Myth of Er as found in the Republic.", "hasanswer": false}]}
